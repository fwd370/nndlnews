Funeral workers wanted in Singapore: At least 800 job vacancies available over next few years,"Faced with an ageing population, Singapore’s annual deaths are set to rise from about 24,000 in 2021 to 40,000 in 2040. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-funeral-jobs-available-annual-deaths-increase-2994166,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's funeral industry is looking to fill at least 800 vacancies over the next few years, amid an expected rise in demand for such services.
The country's annual deaths have been climbing steadily with an ageing population. They are set to nearly double from about 24,000 in 2021 to 40,000 in 2040, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA).
Funeral firms have been looking to hire a new generation of funeral workers. In-demand positions include funeral directors and operations crew.
Passion Bereavement Care founder and funeral director Deborah Kang said most of her employees are recommended by other staff and even the bereaved families. 
















The funeral services provider has grown its team by a third over the past few months, but the number of clients has outstripped its growth, tripling over the same period.
Competition for talent is stiff, with hundreds of funeral companies across Singapore looking to hire more workers. 
Some firms said they have relaxed their criteria for potential employees and are more open to taking in those exploring a mid-career change.
Casket Fairprice corporate development manager Rachael Tay said such a move has managed to help raise its headcount by about 50 to 60 per cent in the past year alone, “even though it does take a longer time to get such workers operationally ready”.

NOVEL WAYS TO RETAIN TALENT
Adding to the industry's manpower woes is the stigma associated with working in the funeral business, observers said.
Nevertheless, funeral firms are looking at different ways to attract and retain talent, from having more work from home arrangements to implementing fewer standby shifts.
Direct Funeral managing director Jenny Tay highlighted the need to look after her employees’ well-being. 
""Through our line of work, we understand the importance of health. So recently, we also implemented yearly medical check-ups for our staff, to at least give them (a) peace of mind about their health,” she said.
The younger generation of workers prefer more stable career options, noted Ms Tay. 
“We do have proper work-life balance, in terms of having proper shifts and rostering. 
“They do not have to be on a 24-hour standby. That’s a big perk. Being able to be aligned with their career preferences will help greatly moving forward.”
Despite a rise in the number of local job applicants for such roles, industry players said they are largely tapping on foreign talent to help fill up their vacancies.
RELYING ON FOREIGN WORKERS
The Association of Funeral Directors believes the local talent pool is not enough and needs to be supplemented by foreign workers to meet the higher demand.
However, Mr Hoo Hung Chye, the association’s executive director, said funeral services come under the service sector, where the number of foreign workers that can be hired in some skilled roles such as embalmers is limited by a tightened quota.
Mr Hoo, who is also the senior funeral director at the Singapore Funeral Services, urged the authorities to relax restrictions for funeral companies to hire more foreign workers. 
“We feel that there should be some leniency in terms of how we can get skilled labour to help our industry.”
Even though the industry is grappling with manpower constraints, those who are keen are coming forward. 
Mr Foo Yong Oon, 26, is among 10 new staff members who recently joined Passion Bereavement Care. He is part of the company’s logistics crew.
""This job is very meaningful, which makes me want to continue and get even better at it,"" he said."
Woman and 14-year-old girl taken to hospital after KPE accident involving 9 vehicles,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kpe-accident-9-vehicle-pileup-oct-27-3031011,"SINGAPORE: A 40-year-old woman and a 14-year-old girl were taken to hospital on Thursday (Oct 27) after an accident involving eight cars and a van on the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE).
The accident occurred on the KPE in direction of the Tampines Expressway after the Bartley Road East exit.
The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) were alerted to the accident at about 4.45pm. 
The woman was driving one of the cars involved in the accident. She and the teenager were taken conscious to the hospital.
Footage posted online of the accident's aftermath showed most of the vehicles in the centre lane of the expressway, with SPF and SCDF at the scene.

SAF formally establishes Digital and Intelligence Service,"The Singapore Armed Forces now has four services: Digital and Intelligence Service, the Army, Navy and the Air Force.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-armed-forces-saf-digital-intelligence-service-inauguration-parade-3028641,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) officially established its fourth service - the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) - on Friday (Oct 28).
This comes two months after Parliament approved amendments to the SAF Act and the Constitution to include DIS as a service under the SAF.
First announced in March, the DIS was set up to integrate the SAF’s capabilities in dealing with a wide spectrum of external threats, including those in the digital domain.
To mark the occasion, two guard-of-honour contingents formed by DIS - wearing the new service’s white and grey ""Number 1” ceremonial dress uniform - took part in an inauguration parade on Friday.
The event was held at SAFTI Military Institute and officiated by President Halimah Yacob.
Madam Halimah also presented a letter of appointment to Brigadier-General (BG) Lee Yi-Jin - who will head the new service - and conferred DIS its State Colours.

With 23 years in the service, BG Lee served in various command appointments, including Commanding Officer of the 21st Battalion Singapore Artillery, Commander of the 3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade and Commander of the 6th Singapore Division and Headquarters Sense and Strike. 
He also held various key staff appointments, including as Assistant Chief of the General Staff (Plans) and Group Chief Policy and Strategy at the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).
The 42-year-old also oversaw contact tracing operations as Commander of the Health Surveillance Task Force in 2020. 
As Director of Military Intelligence and Chief of the C4I (command, control, communications, computers and intelligence) community, BG Lee laid the foundations for the establishment of the DIS - helping to chart its mission, define its role within the SAF and design its organisational and manpower structure.
Meanwhile, BG Mark Tan, who is also Defence Cyber Chief, has been appointed Chief of Staff Digital and Intelligence Staff.
Military Expert 5 (ME5) Noh Kok Tiong has been named Chief Expert of DIS.

SAF’s new Digital and Intelligence Service to recruit more digital experts













Speaking at Friday's parade, Mdm Halimah said the establishment of the new service is timely and necessary for the SAF to adapt to changing security threats.
“In the past decade, we have witnessed many attacks on other countries, not through traditional armed conflicts, but through the digital realm,” she said, adding that such attacks can be orchestrated by state and non-state actors.
“The impact of these digital attacks is real and can result in disruption of essential services, data theft, and even local elections.”
To fulfil its mandate, she said the DIS will not only need a highly-skilled digital corps, but also those trained in other domains such as psychology and social sciences to understand the motivations and means of hybrid threats, and respond decisively.
""My hope is that the DIS will nurture a skilled and competent workforce that will not only defend our digital borders, but also contribute to a strong national digital ecosystem in Government and key sectors of the economy,"" she said.

DEFENDING THE DIGITAL DOMAIN 
The DIS will have a service headquarters, four commands as well as a Digital Ops-Tech Centre, which will equip the SAF with a quick response force to meet new operational requirements on the digital frontier. 
At a media briefing on Wednesday, Colonel Letchumanan Narayanan, who heads the implementation of the DIS office, said it will take time to build up the capabilities of the new service, citing challenges such as attracting new talents.
“We are currently mostly an (SAF) regular force, we have a good proportion of full-time national servicemen (NSF) and defence executive officers but we expect the NSF and NSmen (operationally-ready national servicemen) to grow over time,” he said.
While he did not reveal the strength of the new service due to operational reasons, COL Letchumanan said the bulk of the workforce will come from the military domain expert scheme, which recruits and trains SAF regulars to develop deep expertise and specialisation in key areas such as engineering and intelligence. 
Currently, there are three vocations under the scheme. They are: Command, Control, Communications, Computers expert (C4X), military intelligence expert, as well as digital and intelligence systems engineer.
NSmen with matching talents and relevant civilian expertise can also express their interest to serve in the DIS through the Enhanced Expertise Deployment Scheme, which aims to better optimise and maximise manpower resources to meet operational needs.
In March, MINDEF announced that selected NSFs will undergo a new scheme where they can take up modules to earn academic credits at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) that contribute to a degree in data science and AI, computer science or computer engineering, while serving four years of national service. 
“It’s going to be the work of a generation and I think 10 years from now, you should see a far more capable DIS but also still with the same mindset of starting up and evolving quickly, such is the nature of our job,” said COL Letchumanan."
Two victims of staged kidnap scams found in Cambodia after travelling from Singapore,"The two university students were told to travel to Cambodia and record videos of themselves pretending to be kidnap victims.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/staged-kidnap-scam-victims-students-cambodia-singapore-fake-china-police-3030701,"SINGAPORE: Two university students living in Singapore were found in Cambodia after being tricked into travelling there as part of staged kidnap scams, said the police on Friday (Oct 28).
In both cases, the victims' parents who were based in China received videos of their sons with their hands tied together. They also received ransom demands from unknown people.
The parents reported the cases to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Oct 19 and Oct 22.
The first case involved a 21-year-old student who has been living in Singapore for at least four years, while the second case involved a 22-year-old student who had been living in Singapore for at least three years. 
The students in both cases received calls from scammers who claimed to be police officers from China. The scammers told the victims that they were implicated in the spread of misinformation in China – in the first case, about monkeypox, and the second, about COVID-19 in Guangdong.
The scammers demanded the victims' assistance in investigations and told them to travel to Cambodia to carry out ""missions"", said the SPF.
When the victims arrived in Phnom Penh, they were instructed by the scammers to record videos of themselves pretending to be kidnapped victims for the purposes of scam education and investigations.
They were also asked to stay at different hotels and to cease all communication with their family and friends. 
The scammers then sent the videos to the victims' parents and demanded ransoms – RMB 2,000,000 (S$389,797) in the first case and RMB 800,000 in the second case. No ransoms were paid.
With the help of the Cambodian National Police (CNP) and the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Phnom Penh, the police located the victims in Phnom Penh and reunited them with their families.
Police investigations into both cases are ongoing.

“The exercise of police powers is an exercise of state powers. Overseas law enforcement agencies do not have any legal powers to conduct investigations in Singapore without the approval of the Singapore Government,"" said Mr David Chew, director of the Commercial Affairs Department.
""Demands made by overseas law enforcement officers requesting victims to comply with their orders in Singapore, including orders to remit money overseas, transfer money into Singapore bank accounts, deliver documents in Singapore or travel overseas to carry out secret police missions are illegal, and should be ignored.""
He advised members of the public targeted by these criminals, especially foreign students in Singapore, to check with the police, or call their embassies or high commissions to verify the claims of the purported police officers from their home country. 
""As police powers cannot be exercised outside our national borders, once victims or their money leaves Singapore, we have to rely on foreign authorities to help trace it and ensure the safety of victims,"" said Mr Chew. 
He thanked the Cambodian police for their support and assistance in locating and ensuring the safety of the two victims.
""The police take a serious view against any person who may be involved in scams, whether knowingly or unwittingly. Anyone found to be involved in such scams will be subjected to police investigations,"" said the SPF.

Members of the public are advised by the police to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties with the + prefix phone numbers that originate from overseas.
Ignore such calls and the caller’s instructions. No government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms (WeChat or Facebook), or ask for personal banking information such as Internet banking passwords.
For foreigners receiving calls from people claiming to be from the police in their home country, call their embassy or high commission to verify the claims of the caller.
Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank details, such as Internet bank account usernames and passwords, OTP codes from tokens, are useful to criminals.
Do not make any fund transfers if the caller is of dubious identity.
Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before acting.
If an overseas law enforcement officer is ordering you to do things in Singapore from overseas under the colour of their national office, hang up the call and check with the SPF.
Those with information related to such crimes can call the police hotline at 1800 255 0000, or dial 999 for urgent police assistance.
To seek scam-related advice, members of the public may call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800 722 6688 or visit its website."
"Lorry driver investigated after metal plates fall from vehicle, causing jam at KPE entrance",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kpe-nicoll-highway-entrance-jam-lorry-driver-investigated-3030101,"SINGAPORE: The police are investigating the driver of a lorry after metal plates fell from the vehicle and caused a traffic jam at an entrance to the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) on Monday (Oct 24).
Traffic on a slip road leading to the expressway was blocked by the metal plates, leading to a 30-minute jam, a Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesperson told CNA on Friday.
LTA was alerted to the incident at the Nicoll Highway entrance to the KPE towards the Tampines Expressway at around 4.45pm on Monday. 
LTA's vehicle recovery services and traffic marshals were dispatched to investigate, and they found that the metal plates had rendered the road impassable. 
The slip road was immediately closed off and vehicles were guided away from the area, the spokesperson added. 
""Preliminary assessment was that the metal plates could have fallen off from a lorry and this was confirmed when the driver of the lorry subsequently returned to the incident site with lifting equipment to retrieve the metal plates,"" the spokesperson said. 
Footage of the incident circulating online showed a long line of vehicles stuck in a jam on the slip road. Pictures posted on social media showed several metal plates on the road, blocking the movement of vehicles. 
The slip road was closed for about seven hours to facilitate repairs as the fallen metal plates had damaged the road surface. 
It reopened to traffic at midnight after localised resurfacing works were completed. 
""LTA would like to take this opportunity to remind drivers of goods vehicles to check that their load is properly secured before moving off to ensure the safety of all road users,"" the spokesperson said. 
The police added that no injuries were reported. Investigations are ongoing.

DBS’ Piyush Gupta explains how the bank deals with digital trust in an era of deep fakes and misinformation,"In an exclusive interview with CNA’s Asia First, Mr Gupta spoke about the challenges of tackling cybersecurity and privacy, and establishing trust in the digital world.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cybersecurity-privacy-piyush-gupta-dbs-digital-trust-3030521,"SINGAPORE: As deep fakes and misinformation emerge as the biggest challenges in the digital world, there will be a need for a global infrastructure to tackle the problem, DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta said on Friday (Oct 28).
Every day, DBS identifies more than 100 phishing sites parading as the bank and while these sites can get taken down within an hour or two, more solutions are needed to tackle bigger problems, he said.
“When you think of the enormity of this problem on a global scale, if somebody is doing a deep fake, out to some other part of the world, different geography, do I have the access … to bring it down? It’s not that straightforward,” he told CNA’s Asia First in an exclusive interview.
















“I think you're going to need a global infrastructure, ‘Interpol of the Internet’, if you will, to try and really think about: ‘how do you make these things happen?’”
Security is “paramount” today, said Mr Gupta on the sidelines of the world’s first global SGTech forum on digital trust being held in Singapore.
“There are not only state actors, but large criminal syndicates, who are always trying to get into … not only end user devices - what you carry in your pocket - but the intermediate devices.""
DBS’ SECURITY STRATEGIES
DBS invests a lot of time and energy in its peripheral defense, using what is called an “onion layer strategy”, with seven or eight layers of security, he said.
“I go with the premise that this is not a matter of if, but when. Some time or the other, somebody can get in. So, the other thing we do around security is use a lot of techniques which assume that somebody's going to get inside,” he said.
Among these techniques are micro-segmentation, pattern recognition, analytics and the use of artificial intelligence, he said.
One of the things DBS does, is that it contracts agencies that are constantly operating on the dark web and the deep web, that scour the web to see if there is any reference to DBS or its brands, he said.
This also helps check “is Piyush Gupta’s picture floating around anywhere spouting things which I've never said”, he quipped.
However, the process is “quite cumbersome”, he said. The focus, once such cybersecurity threats are found, is to take them down as quickly as possible, he added.
Responding to a question on how DBS stays one step ahead of scammers and hackers, Mr Gupta said that it is not possible.

“The truth is, you can't get ahead of the curve. I have no idea who might do a deep fake (and) when - you only have to be responsive, reactive, and be able to do that in as close to real time as you can,” said Mr Gupta.
THE NOTION OF PRIVACY
Mr Gupta also spoke about privacy as another aspect of digital trust during the wide-ranging interview.
Privacy is harder to manage than security, given that it is “not an absolute”, Mr Gupta said.
“The notion of privacy varies considerably from cultures. How the West liberal thinks about data privacy is oftentimes very different from Asia, where the rights of public and right of society often trump the rights of the individual,” he said.
The concept also varies by age and time, making consent architecture applicable to multiple countries challenging, he said.
While privacy and security are essential ingredients for digital trust, there is more to it, he said.
“If you really want to get the same kind of trust in a digital domain that you often have in the physical world, you need to be thinking about, first of all, reliability,” he said.
“The systems have got to be available and work when you need them, and the experience has got to be easy and seamless.”
He acknowledged DBS’ disruption to digital banking services last year and highlighted a recent days-long outage of South Korean super app Kakao.
In the case of Whatsapp, which also recently experienced issues, Mr Gupta noted that people were quick to say: “Can’t trust it, we need to find an alternative.”
ESTABLISHING TRUST
Accountability is also important in establishing digital trust, he said.
“If something goes wrong, do we know who's accountable? How do you establish accountability? And then all of this needs to rest on a bedrock of rule of law … a society where some things go wrong, we have an element of recourse you can go for a legal construct,” he said.
Specifically on establishing trust when it comes to DBS’ digital assets trading platform, Mr Gupta said that one of the good things about blockchain, and distributed ledger technology in general, is that the underlying protocols are built on being able to establish authenticity and trust much better than the old paradigm.
In contrast, the traditional system relies on institutions like banks for information, he said.
“Even though we believe that that (the old paradigm) is trustworthy, it is really quite easy to change the record, to hack the system, whereas the digital ledger or blockchain technology requires a preponderance of evidence across a multiplicity of players to be able to actually change records,” he said.
He noted that blockchain and distributed ledger technologies can be better forms of authentication and authorisation than traditional measures.
The challenge is getting to a stage of exponential large scale, and whether people are willing to accept it, he said. The process will take time, he added.
However, these newer technologies are not without their faults, he said.
“Increasingly, you also need to have guardrails to make sure people are not misusing the system. Today, you can authenticate and authorise, but you can't keep out bad actors,” he said, citing money laundering as an example.
“There are agencies today who do purity checks to make sure that tokens are authentic, genuine, they're not being tainted. But again, the software infrastructure - I suppose this will also need to improve.”"
Indonesia to extend gas supply contract with Singapore by 5 years: Energy minister,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/indonesia-extend-gas-supply-contract-singapore-5-years-energy-minister-3030416,"JAKARTA: Indonesia will extend its gas supply contract with Singapore by five years, Energy Minister Arifin Tasrif told reporters on Friday (Oct 28), but the distribution volume is expected to be lower.
The current contract for piped natural gas via the Grissik-Batam-Singapore Pipeline is due to expire next year.
Tasrif told Reuters last week that the new contract might be signed as early as next week.
Under the new contract Indonesia will likely supply a lower volume of gas to Singapore.
""First, domestic demand is also rising, and then these wells are also depleting,"" he said, without elaborating.
Separately, Dwi Soetjipto, chairperson of Indonesia's upstream oil and gas regulator SKK Migas, told reporters that the supply volume may be lowered by 30 per cent to 40 per cent, as local industries, such as fertiliser producers were seeking more gas.
Both officials said that Indonesia would get better pricing for the new contract but declined to disclose details.
Gas supplies to Singapore commenced via the 468km pipeline in 2003."
Man jailed for assaulting cabby who refused flag-down job as he was waiting for taxi booking,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/koh-liang-cai-man-jailed-assaulting-cabby-who-refused-flag-down-job-he-was-waiting-taxi-booking-3030381,"SINGAPORE: After drinking alcohol at Zouk, two men approached a taxi hoping to flag it down for a ride home.
However, the cabby rejected the request as he was waiting for a phone booking for a better fare. As a result, he was assaulted by the two men.
One of the men, 30-year-old Koh Liang Cai, was sentenced to four weeks' jail on Friday (Oct 28). He pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt.
The court heard that Koh was drinking at Zouk in River Valley Road on New Year's Eve two years ago with several people including co-accused 31-year-old Muhammad Taleb Kishen Muhammad Faisal.
At around 2.30am on Jan 1, 2020, Koh finished drinking and spotted a taxi parked at the side of the road. The cabby had just gone there and was waiting for a taxi booking via a phone call, as that would result in him getting a better taxi fare.
Koh called Taleb to head to the taxi with him. They spoke to the cabby through the passenger seat window, with Taleb asking if the cabby could ferry his wife home.
The taxi driver rejected the request and told Taleb to get another cab from the taxi stand at Clarke Quay instead.
Koh then reached through the front passenger seat window and punched the taxi driver once between his temple and eye.
Taleb then went to the driver's side window and held the victim down. Koh then threw another punch at the back of the cabby's head.
Taleb began punching the cabby's face multiple times, landing blows mainly on his eye and nose. He also placed the victim in a chokehold. Koh subsequently left the area.
Soon after, police officers came by the scene and Taleb released his hold on the victim. The victim did not punch either of the two men, the court heard.
He also did not drive his cab away, as he was afraid of injuring the people around his taxi.
He suffered injuries from Taleb's attacks, but felt only pain from Koh's assault, the prosecutor said.
The prosecutor asked for four weeks' jail for Koh. Taleb's case is pending. 
For voluntarily causing hurt, Koh could have been jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$5,000, or both."
Singapore’s total employment grows in Q3 but job market shows signs of slowing momentum: MOM,"Unemployment rates inched up from a six-year low while retrenchments rose to 1,600 from the previous quarter’s all-time low of 830.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/total-employment-q3-mom-labour-report-advance-estimates-retrenchments-3030266,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's labour market continued to improve in the third quarter of 2022, with total employment - excluding migrant domestic workers - growing by 75,600.
This surpasses the previous quarter's growth of 66,500.
""With this expansion, total employment surpassed its pre-pandemic level by 1.7 per cent in September 2022,"" said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in its advance estimates on Friday (Oct 28).
Non-residents accounted for most of the expansion, mainly in construction and manufacturing.
More residents also found employment, although the pace of increase has eased, noted MOM.
But unemployment rates and retrenchments rose in the third quarter. The number of retrenchments increased to 1,600 from the previous quarter’s all-time low of 830.
While the removal of COVID-19 restrictions and border measures have supported the labour market's recovery in recent quarters, there are signs of slowing momentum in the third quarter, said MOM.
""In the coming months, a deteriorating global economic environment, higher global inflation, as well as geopolitical tensions, will impact the labour market,"" it added.
TOTAL EMPLOYMENT
Non-resident employment grew steadily across all sectors, with the increases concentrated in the construction and manufacturing sectors which are more reliant on foreign workers.
More were also hired in the accommodation sector amid heightened demand for manpower resulting from the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
As for resident employment, increases were led by the outward-oriented sectors of information &
communications, professional services and financial services.
But ""sustained declines"" were observed in administrative & support services, said MOM, partly reflecting the gradual scale-back of COVID-related roles such as safe-distancing ambassadors and vaccination centre workers.
""In the final quarter of 2022, some unevenness in growth could emerge across sectors,"" the ministry said in its report. 
""Demand in tourism- and consumer-related sectors should remain robust, supported by the recovery of international visitor arrivals and hiring for the year-end festive season. In contrast, trade-reliant sectors such as manufacturing may experience more subdued employment growth as external demand weakens.""

Singapore economy to slow further in 2023 amid global challenges: MAS



















Singapore's core inflation rises further to 5.3% in September, edging towards 14-year high













UNEMPLOYMENT, RETRENCHMENTS
After falling to a six-year low in August, unemployment rates edged up slightly in September to 2 per cent overall, 2.9 per cent for residents and 3.1 per cent for citizens.
""However, the rates remained within the pre-COVID range,"" said MOM.
While retrenchments also increased, the figure remains lower than the pre-pandemic quarterly average.
Layoffs in the third quarter were from services, primarily due to business reorganisation or restructuring, as well as manufacturing as a result of the discontinuation of product lines, said MOM.
It noted that the manufacturing sector has been facing increasing headwinds amid the global slowdown.
""Firms may also be restructuring business operations and laying off employees in anticipation of a weakened global economy, against the backdrop of high inflation, tighter central bank monetary policies and geopolitical uncertainties,"" said the ministry.
It added that based on polls on firms' hiring and wages sentiment, companies remain optimistic about hiring.
""This will further support employment growth in the final quarter of 2022, as employers hire more actively for the year-end festive season,"" said MOM.
""The proportion of firms intending to raise wages in the next three months has also held steady at
about one in four, indicating that firms remain prudent about raising wages. The risk of a wage-price spiral hence remains low for now.""
NTUC assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said that despite a fairly good labour market report compared with a year ago, there remains ""significant uncertainty"" over the global economy's trajectory of recovery.
There are also various risk factors locally and globally, such as high inflation, energy prices, cost of living, geopolitical and global economic uncertainties.
""Notwithstanding, I am cautiously optimistic that both the retrenchment and unemployment figures for the rest of 2022 will remain low and the biggest challenge from the figures and in-demand jobs is the need to overcome the structural unemployment problem,"" he said in a Facebook post.
He noted that MOM's comment on the wage-price spiral and companies' intention to raise wages comes on the back of various pronouncements such as the ""great resignation"", ""great reshuffling"", and ""quiet quitting"".  
Mr Tay added: ""I guess this comes at a time to allay fears and concerns over wage-price spiral in the economy and to reassure the market that this may not be out of control especially as companies and businesses react to what’s happening globally and the relatively mixed and uncertain outlook for 2023.
""I also expect tripartite partners would want wages to rise in tandem with productivity.""
In his post, Mr Tay also said that he expects the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons to continue to remain high, with tight labour market conditions pervading for the rest of the year.
He added that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that both the retrenchment and unemployment figures for the rest of 2022 will remain low.

HDB resale flat prices propped up by 'unrelenting interest' in million-dollar deals: Analysts,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-resale-flat-prices-strong-demand-million-dollar-transactions-property-3030186,"SINGAPORE: Continued strong demand and “unrelenting interest” in million-dollar deals are among factors that have pushed up prices of Housing Board resale flats for the 10th consecutive quarter, analysts said.
Official figures released on Friday (Oct 28) showed Housing and Development (HDB) resale prices for the third quarter were up 2.6 per cent from the previous three months, slightly above the flash estimate of 2.4 per cent provided by HDB earlier this month.
“The continued rise in resale prices in the third quarter was a result of steadfast demand for HDB resale flats and unrelenting interest in million-dollar deals, both of which fuelled overall resale price growth,” said Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Group.
The third quarter also saw 7,546 resale flat transactions, up 10.7 per cent from the earlier quarter.
The exuberant HDB resale market - even in the face of rising interest rates - prompted authorities to announce another slew of property curbs last month.
This included tighter limits on housing loans and a wait-out period of 15 months for private property owners downgrading to HDB resale flats.
Analysts said the effects of these measures will likely be felt in the coming quarter, and help to moderate price growth.
STRONG DEMAND AND MILLION-DOLLAR DEALS
Several factors are fuelling the persistently strong demand for HDB resale flats.
For one, first-time buyers with “urgent housing needs” are increasingly unwilling to wait out long completion times for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, said PropertyGuru Singapore’s country manager Tan Tee Khoon.
There is also an “enduring” preference for larger homes, Dr Tan said, citing a survey by his firm that showed 44 per cent of resale flat buyers taking a keen interest in jumbo flats.
“Due to their size and the dwindling supply of these bigger flat types, these in-demand flats can command price premiums, which contributed to the number of million-dollar HDB flats transacted.”
Other bigger flat types have also seen keen demand and in turn, higher prices.
Resale transaction numbers for four-room, five-room and executive flats in the third quarter were the highest since the fourth quarter of 2021, said Mr Sandrasegeran. 
Among them, executive flats saw the largest growth with a total of 552 resales transacted, versus 475 in the second quarter.

This demand for larger homes is “one of the main drivers” for headline-grabbing million-dollar flat sales, said Mr Sandrasegeran, adding that around 65 per cent of the 277 million-dollar flats sold in the first nine months of this year were five-room units.
Overall, the pace of million-dollar flat sales has surpassed that of last year, Dr Tan said.
There were 111 million-dollar HDB resale flat transactions that breached the million-dollar mark in the third quarter of 2022 – a record number of such deals in one quarter alone, he said.
Meanwhile, more estates continue to see resale flats breach the seven-digit mark, as high private property prices prompt more “downgraders” to turn towards the HDB resale market.
“These buyers are likely to turn towards non-mature estates, which are further away from the city centre, but more affordable than their city-fringe counterparts,” Dr Tan added.
Another factor driving home buyers to the HDB resale market, according to Mr Sandrasegeran, is how “fixed” interest rates offered by HDB act as a “safe and promising option” in an environment of continued interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve, which has had a spillover effect on local rates.
The concessionary interest rate for HDB loans is pegged at 0.1 per cent above the prevailing Central Provident Fund (CPF) Ordinary Account (OA) interest rate of 2.5 per cent. This is reviewed quarterly, but has remained unchanged since 1999.

PRICE GROWTH TO MODERATE: EXPERTS
However, the pace of growth in third-quarter HDB resale prices has also slowed compared to the second quarter, when prices rose 2.8 per cent.
This slower price growth indicates that the housing sector is starting to feel the effects of rising interest rates and inflation, said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.
“Rising inflation will erode buyers’ affordability, especially middle- and lower-income Singaporeans, who form the bulk of purchasers. As more budget is used for necessities and daily expenditures, buyers may be less willing to pay more for their next home,” she said.
Ms Sun noted that Singapore’s HDB resale market will remain attractive in the long term, even with the cooling measures in place.
This boils down to factors such as a tight domestic labour market, strong household balance sheets and sustained income growth; all of which will continue to prop up housing demand.
“Past trends indicate that our property market is highly resilient and usually rebounds within six months of a cooling measure (announcement),” she said.
But industry experts are still expecting price growth to moderate in the coming quarter as the effects of the latest property curbs, such as a lower loan-to-value limit for HDB loans, kick in.
The costs of financing an HDB flat will also increase due to rising mortgage rates, said PropertyGuru's Dr Tan.
Banks have already been making swift adjustments to their mortgage rates, with the three local lenders – DBS, OCBC and UOB – raising their fixed rate home loans to as high as 3.85 per cent earlier this month.
“As buyers and sellers recalibrate their expectations, it is expected that sales will slow in the immediate term,” said Dr Tan.
Huttons Asia’s senior director of research Lee Sze Teck agreed, noting that HDB resale prices are likely to moderate in the fourth quarter in the wake of the latest cooling measures.
“Private property owners will now need to sell off their private property and wait 15 months before they can buy an HDB resale flat. This effectively cuts off the demand from (these buyers),” he said.
That said, some demand may flow to the 4-room flats and inadvertently push up prices for this smaller flat type.
Under the new curbs, the 15-month wait-out period will not apply to those aged 55 and above, who will still be able to move from a private property to a four-room or smaller HDB resale flat.
Mr Lee noted that in the third quarter, three-room and four-room flats saw average price growth of 2 per cent and 1.7 per cent from the previous three months.
He also pointed to a recent sale of a four-room flat at Pinnacle@Duxton for S$1.37 million, which marks the most expensive four-room flat in Singapore to date.
Meanwhile, HDB resale volume should stay in the range of 6,500 and 7,000 in the fourth quarter, translating into a full year volume of around 28,000 units, said Mr Lee.
“The largest-ever BTO launch in November may draw some demand away from the resale market,” he added.
“Prices are likely to moderate further to 1 per cent to 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, giving rise to a full year price gain of not more than 10 per cent.”"
Disbarred lawyer Samuel Seow gets jail and fine for abusing employees in 2018,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/samuel-seow-theng-beng-disbarred-entertainment-lawyer-sentenced-court-abusing-employees-2018-3030226,"SINGAPORE: Former lawyer Samuel Seow Theng Beng was sentenced to four weeks' jail and fined S$1,500 on Friday (Oct 28), over an incident in 2018 where he abused employees - including his niece - in a clip that went viral.
This comes after the Court of Three Judges struck Seow off the rolls over the same incident, after a career of about 20 years. 
Seow, 49, had pleaded guilty previously to one charge each of voluntarily causing hurt and using criminal force. Two other charges were taken into consideration.
The incident occurred at Seow's former law firm in South Bridge Road on Apr 17, 2018.
He forcefully poked an employee's forehead with his finger and pushed a file she was holding. He also approached his own niece, who worked for him at the time, by grabbing her arm and slapping her.
The incident later went viral due to two leaks: When an audio recording of the incident was leaked in 2018, and when closed-circuit television camera footage capturing the incident was posted on YouTube in 2019.
Seow's case was protracted, with a series of additional hearings about his mental condition and a change of lawyers midway. In the end, the court declined to impose a mandatory treatment order for him to undergo psychiatric treatment.
Lawyer Edmond Pereira on Friday asked for leniency, saying that ""six minutes of sheer madness"" have changed Seow's life.
He said Seow has been ""punished with the ultimate in respect of his career"", as he is no longer allowed to practise as a lawyer.
He has faced two actions - one by the Law Society which resulted in his disbarment, and one by the State Courts for the criminal charges, said Mr Pereira.
He added that Seow was subject to cyberbullying.
The prosecution had asked for at least three weeks' jail and a fine, while the defence asked for one to two weeks' jail and a fine.
District Judge Ronald Gwee said the case called into sharp focus the relationship between employers and employees.
He said ""many of us"" may have personally experienced having bosses who are ""overbearing, demanding, bad-tempered"" or any other negative adjectives.
However, this situation in particular was one where the employer crossed the line and used violence against an employee, said the judge.
Such acts must be condemned, he said.
Seow's lawyer asked for the jail term to be deferred to early November, saying it was customary for Seow's family to meet for All Saints' Day. The judge granted him a deferment to Nov 3."
Singapore's private home prices up by 3.8% in third quarter,"Fewer people bought private property in this quarter due to rising interest rates and higher prices, says one property analyst.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-private-home-prices-rise-38-cent-q3-ura-3030061,"SINGAPORE: Private home prices rose at a slower pace of 3.8 per cent in the third quarter of this year after a strong second quarter.
It was largely driven by the prices of non-landed homes across Singapore, which went up 4.4 per cent this quarter.
The private residential property price index increased to 187.8, up from 180.9 in the second quarter, according to real estate statistics released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday (Oct 28).
Prices of non-landed properties rose 4.4 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent last quarter.
Non-landed home prices in the core central region rose by 2.3 per cent, compared with 1.9 per cent in the previous quarter.
Those in the rest of the central region went up by 2.8 per cent, a decrease compared with the 6.4 per cent jump in the second quarter.
Prices of non-landed homes outside the central region saw the biggest jump, increasing by 7.5 per cent in the third quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the last quarter.
""By market segment, prices rose the most in the suburbs or outside the central region, which increased by 7.5 per cent. This is the steepest quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2009"" when that figure was 16.1 per cent, said OrangeTee & Tie’s senior vice president of research and analytics Christine Sun.
Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons Asia, said three major launches in this region in the third quarter - AMO Residence, Lentor Modern and Sky Eden@Bedok - are probably the drivers behind the increase in prices.

HDB resale transactions rise 10.7% in Q3













Landed home prices increased by 1.6 per cent in the third quarter of this year, compared with a 2.9 per cent rise in the previous quarter.
Resale transactions accounted for about 60.5 per cent of all sale transactions in the third quarter. There were 3,719 resale transactions, compared with 4,236 units in the preceding three months.
Ms Sun said not as many people bought private property this quarter due to ""rising interest rates and higher prices"", pointing to URA data that showed a 9.7 per cent decline in sales volume between the second and third quarters of this year.
RENTS GREW AT FASTEST QUARTERLY PACE SINCE 2007
Rentals of private homes posted an overall increase of 8.6 per cent in the third quarter to hit a new high, after rising 6.7 per cent in the previous quarter.
In the first nine months of this year, rents have risen by 20.8 per cent, Ms Sun said. ""Tenant budgets are stretched to new limits"" as rents grew at the fastest quarterly pace since the third quarter of 2007, she added.
Rentals of non-landed properties in the core central region increased by 7 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 7.7 per cent in the previous quarter. Those in the rest of the central region rose by 9.6 per cent, up from the 5.9 per cent increase in the last three months.
Rentals of non-landed properties outside the central region increased by 8.8 per cent, up from 7.7 per cent, while landed property rentals jumped 10.9 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 3.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
Ms Sun noted that with ""demand far outstripping supply and units readily snapped up by the highest bidder"", many landlords have increased their asking prices above market value.
As a result, tenants are signing longer leases of up to three years ""to secure units and lock in better rates"", Ms Sun explained.
She also said that rising interest rates and inflation are making the situation worse. ""More landlords pass on their increased mortgage repayments and living costs to tenants ... putting a squeeze on tenants' rental affordability,"" Ms Sun said.
She warned renters not to expect a ""quick respite"" from surging rent prices, as the trend of tenants signing longer leases will impact the number of homes available for rental, which may bump up demand.
What will also intensify demand are private homeowners who buy unsubsidised HDB resale flats, who will be affected by a 15-month wait-out period. They are likely to rent in the interim, driving demand, Ms Sun said.
Singapore introduced several property cooling measures on Sep 30, including a new 15-month wait-out period for private homeowners who sell their property prior to submitting an application to buy an HDB resale flat.
Mr Lee of Huttons' noted that the return of foreign students to Singapore and the sustained hiring of expatriates could have been another reason for strong rental demand in the third quarter. 
There has also been ""some 'musical chairs' movement of tenants as the rising rents have exceeded their budget and displaced some of them"", Mr Lee said.
""Some of them have moved from the core central region to the rest of the central region, while some have moved from the rest of the central region to outside the central region,"" pushing up rents in both regions, he added. 
With more homes slated for completion next year, the pace of rental price growth could slow from mid-2023, Ms Sun noted.
SUPPLY
Developers launched 1,455 uncompleted private residential units, excluding ECs, for sale in the third quarter, down from 1,956 units in the preceding quarter.
A total of 2,187 private homes, excluding ECs, were sold in the third quarter, a slight dip from 2,397 sold by developers in the preceding three months. 
No EC units were launched for sale this quarter, while just 28 such units were sold. Last quarter, developers launched 616 EC units for sale and sold 193. 
A total of 3,619 units, including ECs, are expected to be completed in 2022, said URA, while another 20,098 units, including ECs, are expected to be completed in 2023. 
In total, 28,800 units, including ECs, are expected to be completed in 2022 and 2023, close to three times the 10,400 units completed in 2020 and 2021. 
""This will help to cater to housing needs in the immediate term,"" URA said. ""More supply with planning approval, totalling around 31,400 units as of the (third quarter of 2022), will be completed beyond 2023."" 
OUTLOOK 
Ms Sun said climbing interest rates, geopolitical tensions and global recessionary risks may be why investors are losing confidence in equities and riskier assets, choosing instead to invest in real estate, ""widely regarded as a safe-haven asset or a hedge against inflation"". 
""Strong household balance sheets, tight domestic labour market and sustained income growth"" will also prop up housing demand, she said, adding that while rising mortgage rates and prices are squeezing buyers, some will still snap up property before interest rates rise further. 
She said private home prices are projected to rise between 9 per cent and 11 per cent this year. 
""For investors and landlords, surging rents are still cushioning the impact of higher mortgage payments now. If mortgage rates continue to soar and competition stiffens (with more new homes on the market next year), some landlords may face difficulty coping with,"" Ms Sun warned. 
""The situation may worsen when property tax and cost of living increase further."""
Man jailed for trying to pass magazines containing 32 needles to his brother in prison,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/abdul-khaliq-mohammed-shan-man-jailed-trying-pass-his-brother-prison-magazines-32-needles-them-3030161,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to jail on Thursday (Oct 27) for trying to pass magazines with 32 needles hidden in them to his brother in prison.
Abdul Khaliq Mohammed Shan, 60, was given five months' jail and an additional enhanced sentence of 88 days' jail, as he committed the offence while on remission for past offences.
He pleaded guilty to one charge under the Prisons Act of attempting to introduce unauthorised articles into prison.
The court heard that Abdul Khaliq went to the Prison Link Centre in Changi on Jan 19 this year, and handed to the service counter three magazines: Augustman, Her World and Female Magazine.
The magazines were meant for his brother, an inmate in Cluster B of Changi Prison Complex.
Later that day, a visit officer checked the three magazines. She was deployed at the centre to censor reading materials from visitors before handing them to inmates, and was required to scan such materials with a handheld metal detector to check for contraband items.
While scanning the magazines with her metal detector, she found a total of 32 sewing needles hidden in the spines of the magazines.
The needles were between 3.5cm and 4.5cm long.
A prisons officer lodged a police report that same day.
During investigations, Abdul Khaliq claimed that an unidentified man went to his house a few days before his scheduled visit to the prison, and asked for help to pass the magazines to Abdul Khaliq's brother.
Abdul Khaliq claimed he did not know this man's name, had never seen him before and did not have his contact details.
By failing to check the identity of the unknown man or the contents of the magazines before attempting to take them into prison, Abdul Khaliq failed to exercise reasonable care, the court heard.
Abdul Khaliq is currently being rehabilitated at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. He was admitted there in April this year and is due to be discharged in 2025.
The prosecutor asked for four to five months' jail, with an enhancement of 89 days' jail.
Unauthorised sewing needles are sharp objects that could be easily concealed and abused in the wrong hands, and should not be introduced into a secure prison environment, he said.
Abdul Khaliq had also committed the offence about halfway through his remission period for previous offences.
For attempting to introduce unauthorised articles into prison, he could have been jailed up to 12 months, fined up to S$3,000, or both."

CNA Explains: How dangerous are the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 COVID-19 variants?,"What are these new Omicron subvariants and could they cause another COVID-19 wave in Singapore? 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-bq1-bq11-omicron-subvariants-infectious-transmissible-vaccine-covid-19-vaccination-3028401,"SINGAPORE: Singapore on Sunday (Oct 23) confirmed four cases of the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 Omicron subvariants, all of which were imported infections. 
The Ministry of Health (MOH) said it will closely monitor information about new strains, the prevalence of circulating variants in the local community and provide updates should there be significant developments.
Just how infectious are the new subvariants and should people be concerned? Here's what we know so far.
WHAT ARE THE BQ.1/BQ.1.1 VARIANTS?
First detected in Nigeria in July, the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 subvariants are sub-lineages of the Omicron variant BA.5. The strains have since been detected in more than 50 countries.
The number of BQ.1/BQ.1.1 cases has recently been rising in parts of Europe and North America.
""Observations from those countries suggest that BQ.1/BQ.1.1 are possibly more transmissible than previous BA.5 sub-lineages, but there is currently no evidence that they cause more severe illness,"" Singapore's Health Ministry said on Oct 26.
BQ.1.1 has just one mutation more than BQ.1, which itself is only a few mutations away from BA.5.2, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh in response to queries from CNA.
The executive director at A*STAR’s Bioinformatics Institute said that BA.5.2 still dominates globally, but noted that BQ.1.1 now comprises 10 per cent of all sequenced samples in recent weeks and ""has been rising accordingly"".
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also weighed in on the BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 variants, telling CBS News that the two strains have dangerous ""qualities or characteristics"" that could evade some of the current interventions.
HOW TRANSMISSIBLE ARE BQ.1 AND BQ.1.1?
BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 have spread quickly in the United States in the last few weeks, particularly in New York.
Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that both variants made up more than 16 per cent of the total circulating coronavirus variants in the United States. 
The BQ.1 variant had previously made up only 5.8 per cent of circulating variants, while BQ.1.1 had made up 3.6 per cent of all variants, said the CDC.
Dr Fauci said that BQ.1.1 variant is particularly adept at dodging the protective antibodies from prior infection or vaccination.
""These variants (BQ.1 and BQ.1.1) can quite possibly lead to a very bad surge of illness this winter in the US as it's already starting to happen in Europe and the UK,"" said Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warned that the two variants are likely to drive up cases in the coming weeks to months in Europe. It also said that it expected the two variants to account for more than half the infections in Europe between mid-November and early December.

Commentary: New COVID-19 variants have arrived. How worried should you be?



















CNA Explains: What you need to know about the XBB COVID-19 variant













Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease specialist who serves as the technical lead for COVID-19 response at the World Health Organization said in a video posted on Twitter that ""at the present time there are more than 300 sublineages of Omicron that WHO and (its) partners are tracking worldwide.""
""All of the subvariants of Omicron are showing increased transmissibility and properties of immune escape,"" she said
Dr Van Kerkhove added that none of these subvariants are dominant and that there have been no change in severity in the BQ.1.1 and BQ.1 variants.
She however added that ""it's very early and we have very limited data to assess this"".
WILL BQ.1/BQ.1.1 CAUSE A COVID-19 WAVE IN SINGAPORE?
Dr Maurer-Stroh said he expects to see more BQ.1.1 infections globally in the coming weeks.
However, he added: ""This may be less pronounced in Singapore since we just had a wave here and the levels of immunity in the population are higher.""
The BQ.1.1 variant is just one of several lineages currently circulating that has a new spike surface pattern compared to earlier versions, he said, adding that this makes it easier for these variants to infect and reinfect people.
Still, it is likely not more virulent as its rise can be explained by better ability to evade immune responses, said Dr Maurer-Stroh.
Dr Van Kerkhove said that countries need to be prepared and they need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with an increase in hospitalisations.
ARE CURRENT VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS ENOUGH?
Yes, the recommendation for timely boosters would help prolong protective immunity, said Professor Lisa Ng, executive director at A*STAR's infectious diseases labs.
Dr Fauci said that it is ""somewhat encouraging news"" that both strains are sub-lineages of the BA.5 variant, so ""there are almost certainly going to be some cross-protection that you can boost up"".
Meanwhile, Dr Van Kerkhove also said that the current vaccines are effective.
""We (WHO) don't see a change in severity yet and our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,"" she said.
MOH previously said the current mRNA vaccines will be replaced by bivalent vaccines, as recommended by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination.
“The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine, with the same dosage for boosting,” it said.
The bivalent shots will be more effective than the original vaccine in triggering an immune response against newer COVID-19 variants, said Prof Ng.
MOH also said that those aged 50 and above should also receive an additional booster dose between five months and one year from their last dose, to keep up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination.

Man arrested for allegedly attacking elderly man with a chopper,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-arrest-man-attack-chopper-new-upper-changi-road-3028946,"SINGAPORE: A 31-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday (Oct 26) for allegedly attacking an elderly man with a chopper along New Upper Changi Road.
Police officers responded to a report of the case at about 3.35pm on Wednesday. The suspect fled the scene before the police arrived. 
The victim suffered injuries on his head and was taken conscious to the hospital.
Through ground enquiries and using footage from police cameras, officers from Bedok Police Division established the identity of the man and arrested him on Wednesday night.
""A chopper was recovered from a nearby rubbish bin and seized as a case exhibit,"" said the police.
The man will be charged in court on Friday with voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon. The offence carries a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, caning, or a combination of such punishments.

"Five teenagers, aged 14 to 16, arrested for suspected trafficking of cannabis ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/five-teenagers-suspected-drug-trafficking-arrested-cannabis-cnb-3028751,"SINGAPORE: Five teenagers were arrested for the suspected trafficking of cannabis in two separate cases this month, said the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) on Thursday (Oct 27).
The suspects - three aged 14 and two aged 16 - are students from local and international schools, CNB said in a news release.
About 226g of cannabis, estimated to be worth close to S$7,000, food products believed to be infused with cannabis, and drug utensils were seized across the two cases.

In the first case, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the Parcel Post Section detected a parcel containing suspected drug paraphernalia. 
In a follow-up operation, CNB officers arrested a boy and a girl, both aged 16, at Bukit Batok Street 21 for suspected drug trafficking offences. 
About 59g of cannabis, some believed to have been mixed with tobacco and rolled into joints, and drug paraphernalia were seized from the girl's home.

In the second case, a 14-year-old boy accompanied by his father surrendered about 115g of cannabis at a neighbourhood police post. 
The teenager was later escorted to his home, where about 52g of cannabis and food products believed to be infused with cannabis were seized.
In a follow-up operation, CNB officers arrested two more 14-year-old boys for suspected drug trafficking. One was arrested in the Clementi Road area, and the other in the Serangoon Road area.
CNB officers also recovered food products believed to be infused with cannabis from a residential block in the Serangoon Road area.
Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.

""PREVENTIVE EDUCATION IS KEY""
In its news release, CNB highlighted the dangers of cannabis use for young abusers.
""There is well-founded and strong research that has shown short-term and long-term adverse effects associated with cannabis use, including cognitive impairments to youth abusers' developing brains,"" it said.
""These findings corroborate with Singapore's position that cannabis should remain an illicit drug.""
CNB Enforcement Division director Lim Fung Suan called on parents to help educate their children on the dangers of drugs.

‘Humanise’ energy to help people understand roles and choices: World Energy Council chief,"While several countries try to find ways to use greener energy, one territory in Australia has been relying only on renewable energy from 2020.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/renewable-energy-transition-climate-change-world-energy-council-chief-3028816,"SINGAPORE: Conversations on energy tend to centre around money, carbon emissions and electricity, but there is a need to ""humanise"" the topic, said the secretary-general of the World Energy Council.
Making the topic more relatable would help people understand how and why clean energy transition matters to them, said Dr Angela Wilkinson, who is also chief executive of the UN-accredited global energy body operating in 100 countries.
""We tend to talk … about energy transition in terms of trillions of dollars or gigatonnes of carbon or megawatt hours of electricity, and it goes right over people's heads,"" she said in an interview with CNA on Wednesday (Oct 26), on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week. 
""We want a useful energy transition and that means we need to humanise it. People need to understand their roles and choices and they need to understand how to play their part.""
















This would ensure that ""we connect the dots between clean, affordable, reliable and sustainable, rather than just trying to think about one of those and risking crisis in the others"", said Dr Angela.
Moving towards clean energy also involves ""hundreds of thousands"" of smaller steps by communities using energy everywhere in the world, she said.
The world has to shift its thinking away from the supply of energy, which is often prioritised by countries, towards demand-driven solutions that require asking people how they use energy.
""If they had more energy, where would that energy add most value to their lives? And then you start thinking about 'if that's the value add, how do I make that affordable?',"" she said.
ACHIEVING 100 PER CENT RENEWABLE ENERGY
While solutions to tap renewable energy are being explored by several governments to combat climate change and ensure energy security, one Australian district is already living the dream.
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), home to about 456,000 people, has been running completely on renewable energy since 2020.
""Wind and solar farms around our city now supply our territory with all of our electricity needs. This is a great example of what's possible if governments set clear goals,"" ACT's Minister for Water, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury, told CNA.
The change happened as leaders set ambitious, but clear, targets to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate change, while gaining support from the civil service and business community, he said.
""I think a lot of people didn't expect that we could,"" said Mr Rattenbury.
The territory's reliance on clean energy also gives it some degree of energy security and price stability, at a time when electricity prices are increasing quickly in other parts of Australia, he added.
Ongoing 20-year contracts with renewable energy suppliers guarantee the ACT steady electricity prices, which are the lowest in the country.

Mr Rattenbury advised countries and cities to create a well-connected grid that integrates different sources of energy in various geographic regions.
""We will see some areas will have better resources for solar, more sunshine, others will have better wind resources. And of course, they will generate at different times,"" he said, adding that such a diversity of sources strengthens energy security.
GETTING BUY-IN FOR CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
Trialling new clean energy technologies is one way for countries to move towards a greener future, but buy-in from big industry players has not been forthcoming, said Mr Andre Stolz, chief operating officer of Singapore-based clean tech firm EcoWorth Tech.
""A lot more needs to be done and that is where startups can come in to play different roles of bringing truly revolutionary technologies to the market and make an even bigger impact, versus the technologies that are out there since decades (ago),"" he said.
He acknowledged however that it can be challenging for these new technologies to be adopted by big players, who are risk-averse and do not want to be the first movers.
This is especially so for Asian firms, said Mr Stolz.
""They look at counterparts maybe in Europe or the US where they have a bigger leadership role and … then try to adapt readily available solutions, which makes it a bit more difficult for us to be adopted, "" he said.
""But that's maybe an opportunity for these companies here in Asia to make a step ahead and to accelerate their decarbonisation plans.”"

What you need to know about the new assisted living HDB flats in Queenstown for seniors,"How big are the new senior-friendly Community Care Apartments in Queenstown? What are the services provided and lease options available?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/community-care-apartments-hdb-flats-bto-queenstown-seniors-faq-3028446,"SINGAPORE: Built-in wardrobes and service packages are among the features of the new senior citizen-friendly Community Care Apartments (CCA) in Queenstown that will be launched in the upcoming Build-to-Order (BTO) exercise in November.
Community Care Apartments are an assisted living public housing concept jointly developed by the Ministry of National Development (MND), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB).
Aimed at providing more housing options for the elderly, the flats will come with care services that can be tailored to seniors' needs.  
Located within the Queensway Canopy BTO development, it is the second pilot of its kind in Singapore – the first was launched in February 2021 in Bukit Batok.
Here is what you need to know about the new CCA flats.
WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES?
With an internal floor area of about 32 sq m, the units come with a wide wheelchair-friendly main door with a built-in bench at the side.
The bathrooms are wheelchair-accessible and will have slip-resistant flooring and grab bars. The service yard, which has a clothes drying rack, is accessible from the toilet. 
There will be a built-in wardrobe, cabinets and a furnished kitchen to allow seniors to move in quickly with minimal renovations needed.
The flats are designed with an open layout and come with easy-to-slide partitions that separate the living room and bedroom.

WHAT ARE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE?
Besides senior-friendly fittings, CCA flats are designed for seniors to live independently with some healthcare assistance where needed. 
All residents will subscribe to a Basic Service Package, which includes the help of an onsite community manager.
The manager will help arrange add-on care and support services, assist in simple home fixes, and coordinate activities in communal spaces. 
The package also comes with basic health checks, 24-hour emergency monitoring and response, as well as key card access to individual flats. 
Residents can also enjoy access to care services and wellness and social activities at an Active Ageing Centre (Care) located in the Social and Wellness Hub. The hub is next to the CCA block.
They will also get priority admission to a nearby nursing home on the Alexandra Hospital campus if required.
Seniors who may need help with daily living activities or household services can opt for services at additional costs.
The optional services include a shared caregiving service that provides assistance with daily living activities, such as moving around, washing, dressing, eating and using the toilet.
There is also a housekeeping service and meals can be delivered to the home for an extra charge. Residents can also opt for a laundry service.
Prices for these optional services will be reviewed periodically, said the authorities.

WHO'S ELIGIBLE?
To be eligible for the CCA flats, applicants and their spouse, if any, must be 65 years old and above. Families must have at least one Singaporean applicant, and singles must be Singaporeans. 
The average gross monthly household income cannot exceed S$14,000.
Applicants who own private property or an HDB flat must dispose of the property within six months of collecting their keys to the CCA unit. 
Seniors who have received two housing subsidies before and have bought a studio apartment or a short-lease two-room Flexi flat before are not eligible. 
Applicants can choose their lease from 15 years to 65 years, in five-year increments. The lease chosen must be able to cover all applicants and their spouses, if any, until at least 95 years old. 
Priority will also be given to those with care needs, where at least one applicant or essential occupier requires permanent assistance with their daily living activities.
According to HDB, this means always requiring some assistance with activities such as washing or showering, going to the toilet, getting dressed, eating, walking and moving around, as well as transferring, such as moving between the bed and a chair or wheelchair.

HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?
The total cost of the unit consists of two components: The price of the flat and the price of the Basic Service Package. The flat will need to be paid for upfront. 
For the Basic Service Package, residents can choose between two regular payment plans.
In the first plan, S$164 will be paid for the first month at the start of the lease, together with a S$1,968 security deposit that is refundable. The resident then pays S$164 every month for the rest of the lease.
Under the second plan, the resident will pay S$6,200 for the first three years at the start of the lease. Throughout the rest of the lease, they will pay S$6,200 every three years.
Fees will be reviewed periodically and are subjected to the Health Ministry's approval. 
The first CCA project was launched in Bukit Batok in the February 2021 BTO exercise. The pilot drew an application rate of 4.2 applicants per unit. 
For a 15-year lease, the price of a flat in Bukit Batok without first-timer housing grants, resale levy and other payments ranged between S$35,000 and S$40,000. This did not include the Basic Service Package cost.
The flat price rose to between S$42,000 and S$48,000 for a 20-year lease, and between S$48,000 and S$54,000 for a 25-year lease. 
For a 30-year lease, it was between S$52,000 and S$60,000. The longer 35-year lease placed the flat price at between S$56,000 and S$64,000.

Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan reiterates 'deep disappointment' over Myanmar situation,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/myanmar-coup-asean-five-point-consensus-vivian-balakrishnan-reiterates-deep-disappointment-mfa-3028601,"SINGAPORE: Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan on Friday (Oct 27) reiterated Singapore's ""deep disappointment"" over the situation in Myanmar, which has been trapped in a cycle of violence since a coup in February last year.
He was speaking at a Special Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Jakarta, convened to assess progress on the implementation of a Five-Point Consensus on Myanmar and to discuss possible next steps ahead of the biannual ASEAN Summits in Phnom Penh next month.
""The foreign ministers discussed the situation in Myanmar and expressed deep regret over the loss of lives from the recent airstrikes in Kachin State,"" said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement on Friday.
""Minister Balakrishnan reiterated Singapore's deep disappointment at the lack of progress in the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus, the escalation of violence and the worsening situation on the ground.""
The airstrikes last Sunday killed at least 50 civilians, including singers and officers of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), according to media reports.
An ethnic minority force that has long fought for greater autonomy for the Kachin people, the KIA has opposed military rule in the wake of last year's coup, which ousted an elected civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The regime change has prompted the emergence of opposition movements, some armed, across the country, which the military has countered with lethal action.
Southeast Asian countries have led efforts to bring peace to Myanmar, but the junta has done little to implement the consensus agreed upon last April.
At Thursday's meeting, Dr Balakrishnan urged Myanmar's military authorities to ""swiftly and fully implement"" the plan, which includes granting the ASEAN Chair's Special Envoy on Myanmar access to all stakeholders and facilitating the swift, equitable and transparent distribution of humanitarian assistance to all in need, without discrimination, said MFA.
""He reaffirmed the need for ASEAN to engage all stakeholders in Myanmar soon and called for constructive dialogue among all parties concerned to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of the people of Myanmar.""
The foreign ministers agreed to continue discussing recommendations to be proposed to ASEAN leaders at the upcoming summits, MFA added.
Thursday's meeting at the ASEAN secretariat in the Indonesian capital was not attended by any representatives from Myanmar.

"Shipyard operator fined S$200,000 over negligence that led to worker death",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/asia-pacific-shipyard-fined-negligence-workplace-death-2019-3028536,"SINGAPORE: A shipyard operator was fined S$200,000 on Thursday (Oct 27) in relation to the death of a worker who died after he was hit by a forklift in 2019.
On May 26, 2019, 30 year-old Bangladeshi painter and blaster Rahman Zillur was assigned to work on Asia Pacific Shipyard's (APS) site.
""Rahman was walking along a slipway when a forklift transporting a blasting pot to the shipyard’s storage area suddenly accelerated forward, crashed through a guardrail and fell into the slipway,"" the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a press release.
""The forklift struck Rahman, and he died at the scene from his injuries.""
The worker operating the forklift, Shanmugam Sivarasu, was sentenced on Jul 21 to 11 months' jail, said MOM. He had operated the forklift without any training, while knowing the machine's brakes were faulty.
""His reckless act directly caused the death of Rahman,"" said MOM.
The supervisor in charge of the team working at the site, Yeduvaka Mali Naidu, was on Aug 10 sentenced to 11 months' jail after the prosecution's appeal.
He had allowed the untrained Shanmugam to operate forklifts on multiple occasions despite knowing that he was not certified, trained nor competent to do so, the Manpower Ministry said.
""In addition, he was also aware that the brakes of the forklifts were faulty, but he still used the faulty forklifts and allowed the untrained Shanmugam to do so,"" MOM said.

An MOM investigation found that APS, as the occupier of the workplace, had failed to prevent the unauthorised operation of forklifts, ensure their proper maintenance and that maintenance and repair was only performed by competent persons.
""APS’s failures resulted in the fatal accident,"" MOM added.
Lax practices on the ground culminated in the fatality that happened in 2019, said Sebastian Tan, the ministry's director of occupational safety and health inspectorate, adding that the incident was ""unacceptable and totally preventable"".
""Top management must take the lead by ensuring workplace safety and health management systems are effective, while supervisors and workers need to carry this through by ensuring safety practices are adhered to during operations,"" said Mr Tan.

"Singapore's 6-month treasury bill hits 4.19% yield, highest since 1988","This marks the highest yield on a six-month T-bill since more than 30 years ago, when the return rate peaked at 4.73 per cent.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/yield-6-month-t-bill-hit-419-latest-auction-highest-1988-3028411,"SINGAPORE: Yields on Singapore's six-month Treasury bill (T-bill) hit a multi-decade high on Thursday (Oct 27), with the latest auction reporting a cut-off yield of 4.19 per cent per annum.
This marked the highest yield on a six-month T-bill since September 1988, when the return rate peaked at 4.73 per cent.
T-bills are short-term debt securities issued and backed by the Singapore Government, with maturities of one year or less.
Like the Singapore Savings Bonds – another type of Singapore Government Securities – its yields have been on an uptrend this year, as global central banks go on a rate-hike race to curb inflation.
The latest cut-off yield is up from the 3.77 per cent reported for the six-month T-bill issued last week, and up from 0.55 per cent at the start of the year.
Amid rising returns, demand for T-bills has also been heating up.
The latest auction received applications amounting to S$10.9 billion for a total allotment of S$4.6 billion.
The previous issue was also over-subscribed, with S$10.2 billion worth of bids for a total allotment of S$4.5 billion.
All non-competitive bids of S$1.8 billion were allotted in the latest auction, while only 14 per cent of competitive bids were allotted at the cut-off yield, according to results released on the website of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Beyond Singapore Savings Bonds and fixed deposits, what other low-risk investments are there?



















CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?













T-bills are issued via an auction process where competitive and non-competitive bids are placed. 
A competitive bid allows applicants to specify the yield they are willing to accept, while a non-competitive bid is one where investors only specify the amount they want to invest but not the yield.
At each auction, up to 40 per cent of the total issuance size will be allotted to non-competitive bids. If the amount of non-competitive bids exceeds this limit, the allotment will be made on a pro-rated basis. 
Those with successful bids will be allotted the T-bill at the cut-off yield, or the highest accepted yield among successful competitive bids submitted at the auction.
Unlike Singapore Savings Bonds where interest is paid out twice a year, T-bills are issued at a discount and investors will receive the full face value at maturity.
For example, if you applied successfully for a six-month T-bill, you will first receive the full interest – calculated based on the cut-off yield – and get your full principal back when the T-bill matures six months later.
The latest T-bill is set to be issued on Nov 1 this year and will mature on May 2.
SINGAPORE SAVINGS BONDS
Demand also remained strong for Singapore Savings Bonds.
The latest tranche, which has a record-high average return of 3.21 per cent over 10 years, received applications worth S$2.2 billion, doubling from the previous issue.
With only S$900 million worth of savings bonds to be allotted, the quantity ceiling format – applied when applications exceed the issuance size – kicked in, with those who applied for S$10,000 or lower being fully allotted.
Approximately 29.15 per cent of those who applied for S$10,500 or higher were allotted either S$10,000 or S$10,500, with the selection being done randomly, according to results released on MAS’ website.
This tranche of savings bonds will be issued on Nov 1 this year and mature on Nov 1, 2032.

The case for Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman, 57, was heard in court on Thursday (Oct 27). It was adjourned for a pre-trial conference in November, during which fresh trial dates will be taken.
Abdul Rashid faces two charges for flouting COVID-19 regulations by failing to wear a mask inside and outside the State Courts on Jul 2 last year, and in East Coast Lagoon Food Village on Mar 19 last year.
He first appeared in court with British anti-masker Benjamin Glynn last year, claiming to be his lawyer. However, Abdul Rashid was turned away for inappropriate attire.
He later said he did not have a licence to practise but was an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"".
Glynn was given six weeks' jail in August last year for his offences and later deported. During his trial, closed-circuit television footage was played showing him and Abdul Rashid with their masks pulled down to their mouths or chins in court and outside of court.

Abdul Rashid was later charged with mask-related offences and stood trial. On the first day of trial earlier this month, he represented himself.
He said he had a heart condition, and said that the authorities who investigated him had no authority to do so, as he was a ""private, sovereign citizen"".
Less than half an hour into his defence, the judge halted proceedings saying he found it very difficult to follow the incoherent evidence.
He ordered Abdul Rashid to be remanded for two weeks at IMH for psychiatric evaluation.
If convicted of failing to wear a mask when it was required, he can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both per charge."

Singapore and Malaysia signed two water agreements in 1961 and 1962. The first expired in August 2011 and the second agreement will expire in 2061. Under the second agreement, Singapore may draw and use 250 million gallons of raw water per day from the Johor River.
In return, Singapore is obliged to provide Johor with treated water up to 2 per cent of the water imported.

Imported water from Malaysia is one of Singapore's four sources of water, the other three being local catchment water, desalinated water and NEWater, which is high-grade reclaimed water purified with advanced membrane and ultraviolet technologies.
""As one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, we have to think outside the box and tap on technology and innovation to enhance our water resilience,"" said Ms Fu.

She cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent challenge, where Singapore and Malaysia worked closely and found ways to maintain the flow of essential goods and workers, including PUB's staff at the Johor River Waterworks. 
Apart from that, the two countries also face similar climate challenges.
""We are met with extreme weather events including sudden intense rainfall, or prolonged periods of dry weather. Water security, or insecurity, is a common challenge that affects both of us,"" said Ms Fu, adding that Singapore looks forward to working with Malaysia on issues such as water security, as well as coastal and flood protection.

Singapore currently has five NEWater plants in Bedok, Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Changi, with a combined capacity of around 170 million gallons a day.
This can meet up to about 40 per cent of the country's current water demand of 430 million gallons a day.

NEWater is mainly supplied to industries such as wafer fabrication and pharmaceutical plants, which have stringent water quality requirements. It is also injected into reservoirs during dry spells, and mixed with rainwater before it is treated and piped to households for potable use.
A guide also took the delegation through the three-purification process of NEWater, its commercial and potable uses, before the king was presented with a guest book to sign.
The king's final stop for the tour, which lasted less than half an hour, was a visit to the control room of the plant.
















During his state visit, Singapore and Malaysia reaffirmed the excellent state of bilateral ties, ""rooted in wide-ranging cooperation in areas such as infrastructure and education, as well as extensive people-to-people ties"", said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a press statement on Thursday. 
""They also discussed ways to further cooperation, including in emerging sectors like digitalisation and climate change.""
At a state banquet held in the king’s honour at the Istana on Wednesday, President Halimah said that his visit caps a fruitful year of high-level exchanges between Singapore and Malaysia, and reaffirms the close ties between the neighbours.  
“It reaffirms the close relationship between our two countries, which have been linked by bonds of kinship through the generations. There are strong people-to-people ties at all levels,” Madam Halimah said. 
The president added that bilateral cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia – each other’s second-largest trading partner – has grown from strength to strength, especially in areas such as trade, investment, and tourism."
"CCA coach molested 13 students over more than 2 years in school lab, chalet ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cca-coach-molested-13-students-over-more-2-years-school-lab-chalet-3028071,"SINGAPORE: An allied educator who was also the coach of a co-curricular activity (CCA) in a secondary school molested a total of 13 students over more than two years.
The 39-year-old man, who cannot be named due to gag orders imposed by the court, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Oct 27) to six charges. 
They include multiple charges of molestation, procuring an indecent act by a young person and using insulting behaviour causing alarm and distress. Another 23 charges will be considered in sentencing.
The court heard that the offender was an allied educator since 2008, at a school not named in court documents.
He taught English and Literature and was the coach for a CCA that was similarly not identified in court documents.
Between the end of 2015 and 2018, the man molested 13 students who were members of the CCA in a laboratory. The blinds in the lab were always closed on his instructions, and he would remind students that ""whatever happens in the ... lab stays in the ... lab"".
The man also molested students during overnight chalets organised for CCA members. He was the only coach or teacher who would stay overnight with the students.
 
BOY MOLESTED IN CHALET
Sometime in end-2015, a 13-year-old boy attended the annual CCA chalet upon the offender's invitation. 
On the second night of the chalet, while others were playing card games, the boy fell asleep on the sofa in the living room.
He woke up later because he felt someone molesting him, and realised he was lying on a bed. He could not recall how he ended up there. 
The offender was pressed against his back. Scared, the boy did not know how to react and pretended to be asleep. He waited for about half an hour for the offender to fall asleep before feeling it was safe to leave.
Between June 2016 and December 2017, the offender asked this same boy for a kiss on the lips in the school lab. 
The boy was reluctant but felt pressured to comply, so he kissed the man's lips. He felt disgusted and extremely uncomfortable, but kept silent about both incidents.
He felt helpless and did not know who to approach for help. He did not confide in his friends or family as he did not know how to explain the situation and was unsure of how they would react, the prosecutor said.
He called the helpline of the Sexual Assault Care Centre at the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) in December 2017 as he felt extremely stressed about the incidents. 
He told them he had been molested by his CCA coach since Secondary 1, but he did not respond to follow-up calls and messages because he felt afraid.
MAN'S LEWD CONVERSATIONS
Between March 2017 and December 2017, a 14-year-old boy went to the lab to discuss matters about the CCA with the accused.
During the conversation, the accused said that the boy's leg was hairy and asked if it was similarly hairy elsewhere. The boy did not reply.
The man then made a lewd comment and offered to show the boy his own hair. The boy rejected him, but the man plucked out a hair and held it near the boy's face.
The boy felt shocked, insulted and disgusted, the court heard.
The man also molested a 13-year-old boy in October 2018 while they were in the lab. He asked the boy a lewd question while molesting him, shocking the boy who asked to go to the toilet.
The boy did not dare to confront the offender or tell him about his discomfort as he was afraid of the man.
After this, the boy went to the lab less frequently as he was afraid he would be molested again. He would go there only if many other students were around.
Sometime in mid-2018, the offender used a metal blackhead extractor to extract a blackhead from a 15-year-old boy's nose while they were in the lab.
After doing so, he asked the boy to sit on his lap. Thinking the man wanted to extract more blackheads, the boy complied.
However, the man turned his chair around so that they were facing away from the rest of the students in the lab. He then spoke to the boy while molesting him.
The case came to light in October 2018, when one of the CCA members told his mother that he had witnessed the coach touching and kissing some of his CCA mates.
On Thursday, the judge said he intended to have the offender examined at the Institute of Mental Health.
His case was adjourned and he will return to court in November.
In response to CNA's query, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the man has not been employed by the ministry since November 2018. 
""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,"" it added."
Singapore economy to slow further in 2023 amid global challenges: MAS,"Slowing global economic activity and continued COVID-19 curbs in some countries are expected to weigh on growth in Singapore’s major trading partners.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-economy-2023-external-headwinds-mas-review-inflation-labour-demand-3027936,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore economy is projected to slow further at a “below-trend pace” in 2023 amid growing challenges in the external environment, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Thursday (Oct 27).
With that, overall labour demand “should soften somewhat” alongside a moderation in wage growth, the central bank added in its latest half-yearly macroeconomic review.
Advance estimates showed that the Singapore economy grew at 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter, just below the revised figure of 4.5 per cent in the previous three months. Growth was supported in part by industries which continued to benefit from the reopening of borders.
But moving forward, the significant tightening of global financial conditions and continued COVID-19 curbs in some countries are expected to weigh on growth in Singapore’s major trading partners.
This means that the country’s trade-related sector will continue to see subdued growth in the quarters ahead, the MAS wrote in its report.
“Dampened global and regional trade flows will adversely affect activity in Singapore’s manufacturing, wholesale, water transport and storage sectors, even as global supply frictions continue to ease,” it said.
Specifically, the global electronics industry, which enjoyed a strong post-pandemic demand surge until early this year, has seen its outlook deteriorate “rapidly” in recent months. Global chip sales contracted 3 per cent year-on-year between July to August, leading the industry into a “consolidation phase”. 
For Singapore, end demand for electronics products has pulled back in the country’s top two markets –China and the United States – amid high inflation, tighter financial conditions and consumers pivoting to spending on services. Growth in investment demand for technology equipment in the US also “slowed considerably” since its peak last year, it said.
MAS added that a sharper decline in final demand moving forward “could presage an inventory correction of end-products, which would exacerbate the fall-off in sales of intermediate semiconductor inputs, and in turn worsen the oversupply of chips”.
Slowing external demand from heightened global inflation and tighter financial conditions will also continue to dent growth prospects in the financial sector.
In the near term, the outlook for the sentiment-sensitive segments within this sector – such as the fund management industry – is expected to be bearish, alongside further tightening moves by central banks globally, according to the report.
It is also a less rosy prospect for the travel and consumer-facing sectors, which should continue to recover next year, albeit with slower momentum as consumer sentiment could take a hit from inflation and an uncertain economic environment. In addition, unfulfilled pent-up consumption demand is likely to go towards overseas travel, rather than domestic spending.
Likewise for construction, labour shortages and elevated costs of construction materials will weigh on the outlook even as activity continues to pick up in 2023.
“Overall, GDP growth is likely to stay muted in the coming quarters,” MAS said, reiterating the official growth forecast for 2022 at a range of 3 to 4 per cent.
“Amid weaker external demand conditions, the economy is projected to slow further to a below-trend pace in 2023, dragged down by the trade-related cluster.”

SOFTER LABOUR DEMAND, WAGE GROWTH
The moderation in global growth and tightening financial conditions will have “some impact” on labour demand, primarily in the external-oriented manufacturing and modern services sectors, MAS said.
“Notably, the slowdown in global manufacturing demand could act as a drag on the domestic sector’s workforce expansion, given the spillovers through worldwide supply chains, particularly in electronics production. Labour demand in external-oriented modern services could also ease,” it added.
But given the “significant wage flexibility” as well as underlying shortages for skilled workers, labour market adjustments in the external-oriented sectors “should largely take place via a downshift in job vacancies and wage growth, rather than by means of large-scale job losses”. 
“Overall, given the starting point of a very tight labour market, there could be some scope for labour demand to weaken and job vacancies to fall without a significant rise in resident unemployment,” said MAS.
Firms will continue to hire non-residents to fill manpower gaps, particularly in sectors such as construction, marine shipyard and process. Together with moderating labour demand, excess labour market tightness should be further alleviated in the first half of next year.
Accordingly, wage growth is expected to moderate in 2023, but “remain slightly above pre-COVID rates”, it said.
“While labour supply constraints are projected to ease in the second half of 2022, they should continue contributing to above-average wage growth, as the effects of a tight labour market on nominal resident wage growth take about three quarters to be fully transmitted,” the report said.
Meanwhile, other factors, such as the progressive wage model for low-wage workers, will add “short-term boosts” to wage growth.
INFLATION TO REMAIN HIGH
Turning to inflation, MAS reiterated its forecasts for core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport costs, to average around 4 per cent this year. Overall headline inflation should come in at around 6 per cent.
This is due to imported inflation likely remaining “significant” across a range of goods and services, while a tight labour market will continue to support firm wage increases.
Also, amid conducive demand conditions, businesses are expected to raise prices further to pass on the imported and domestic costs that have accumulated within production chains in Singapore and abroad.
Latest data showed Singapore’s core inflation rising further to 5.3 per cent in September, driven mainly by larger increases in the prices of food, services and retail and other goods. This is higher than the 5.1 per cent in August.
Headline consumer price index, or overall inflation, was 7.5 per cent year-on-year in September, unchanged from August.
Core inflation is expected to remain elevated in the first half of next year, before “moderating more discernibly” in the second half as cost pressures ease and demand conditions soften, MAS said.
For 2023, taking into account all factors including a hike in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), core and headline inflation are projected to average between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent, and 5.5 to 6.5 per cent respectively. 
Excluding the effects of the GST increase, core inflation will come in at 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, while headline inflation is set to average at 4.5 to 5.5 per cent.
MAS reiterated that the cumulative effects of its five monetary policy tightening moves since October last year will help “ensure medium-term price stability as a basis for sustainable growth in the economy”."
Woman and father who went to jail in her place over traffic accident charged with perverting justice,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-whose-father-went-jail-her-place-over-traffic-accident-gets-charged-along-dad-audrey-ong-hui-ling-david-ong-3027876,"SINGAPORE: A woman whose father went to jail in her place over a traffic accident was charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice on Thursday (Oct 27), along with her father.
Audrey Ong Hui Ling, 26, was handed four fresh charges. These are for conspiring with her father to pervert the course of justice, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and causing grievous hurt to a motorcyclist by a negligent act endangering human life.
According to charge sheets, she was allegedly driving her father's car without a licence when she failed to stop the vehicle to check for oncoming traffic along Tampines Avenue 2 on Oct 15, 2019.
She then executed a U-turn and collided with a motorcycle, leaving the motorcyclist with a fractured wrist.
Her father, 56-year-old David Ong, was given three charges mirroring his daughter's. They are for conspiring to pervert the course of justice by agreeing to assume criminal liability and for allowing his daughter to drive his car when she had no driving licence nor insurance.
The pair hired lawyer S S Dhillon, who asked for time to take instructions, saying this was a ""complex case"".
They will return to court next month.
THE CASE
The High Court quashed David's conviction earlier this month. According to proceedings then, David allegedly took Audrey's place even though the latter was behind the wheel during the October 2019 accident.
David pleaded guilty in September 2020 to the offence of causing grievous hurt by an act in a negligent manner endangering human life or the personal safety of others.
He was sentenced to five days' jail, which he served, and was banned from driving for two years.
At the time, he claimed he was responsible for the accident, which was a result of his negligence and fatigue from working long hours.
However, in April this year, the police were alerted to an audio recording from David's in-car camera of a conversation he had with his daughter. Court documents did not indicate who alerted the police.
The conversation suggested that David told his daughter he would ""take her place"", the High Court stated on Oct 7.
The penalties for conspiring to pervert the course of justice are a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or both.
For causing grievous hurt by a negligent act, Audrey could be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000, or both.
For allowing his daughter to drive his car when she did not have a licence or insurance, David could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$1,000, or both."
One in three parents in Singapore hesitant to get children vaccinated against COVID-19: Study,"Those with reservations about getting their children vaccinated had a lower level of trust in their children’s doctors, the study found.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parents-hesitant-children-vaccinated-covid-19-3027831,"SINGAPORE: A third of parents in Singapore are hesitant to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, a new study has found. 
The study was conducted between November last year and March this year by a group of paediatricians from the Khoo Teck Puat – National University Children’s Medical Institute at the National University Hospital (NUH). 
It surveyed 628 parents aged between 32 and 45, two-thirds of whom were Singaporeans, on the impact of social media and other factors on vaccine hesitancy towards their children. 
Singapore started offering COVID-19 vaccinations for children between the ages of six months and four years from Tuesday (Oct 25). Children between the ages of five and 11 were also able to get their booster doses from this date. 
















STRENGTHEN RAPPORT WITH CHILDREN’S DOCTORS
Those with reservations about getting their children vaccinated also had a lower level of trust in their children’s doctors. Just 41.8 per cent of vaccine-hesitant parents said they fully trust their child’s doctor.
The same sentiment was shared with 68.3 per cent of parents who would allow their children to be vaccinated.
The recent study found that parents with higher income and education levels had fewer reservations about getting their child vaccinated. 
The vaccination status of parents played a part in their decisions too, with those unvaccinated against the coronavirus being more apprehensive about having their child vaccinated. 
Another finding from the study was that fathers were slightly more vaccine-hesitant than mothers. Among fathers, 39.1 per cent were vaccine hesitant, compared to 30.4 per cent of mothers.

While there was no difference between vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant parents in their use of social media to obtain information about COVID-19, parents who were vaccine-hesitant were less likely to use other sources such as newspapers to obtain relevant information. 
To reduce vaccine hesitancy, doctors have to strengthen their rapport with parents of young children, researchers recommended. 
Dr Low Jia Ming, associate consultant at the NUH’s Khoo Teck Puat – National University Children’s Medical Institute, said: “This requires us to work with each and every parent during opportune moments, during the consultations, to address any of their concerns that they have … and to work together to ensure that they receive the vaccinations in a reassured fashion.”

About 240 assisted living HDB flats for seniors to be launched in Queenstown in November BTO exercise,"The Community Care Apartments in Queenstown integrates senior-friendly housing with care services that can be scaled according to a person’s needs.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-bto-queensway-canopy-assisted-living-flats-seniors-cca-november-exercise-3027816,"SINGAPORE: About 240 assisted living Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats will be launched in Queenstown in the upcoming November Build-to-Order (BTO) exercise.
The Community Care Apartments (CCA) will provide senior-friendly housing with care services that can be scaled according to a person’s needs. 
They aim to better support seniors to age independently within the community, said the Ministry of National Development (MND), Ministry of Health (MOH) and HDB in a joint factsheet on Thursday (Oct 27).
This is the second CCA pilot, with the first in Bukit Batok - launched in February 2021 - drawing an application rate of 4.2 applicants per unit.
The flats in Queenstown will be part of the Queensway Canopy BTO development, sited alongside blocks of three-room and four-room flats.
“This deliberate integration is to encourage and promote intergenerational bonding as well as foster inclusivity and community interaction,” said the authorities.
Located at Queen’s Crescent, Queensway Canopy is situated within the Health District @ Queenstown. 
The district is where HDB, the National University of Singapore (NUS), healthcare partners like the National University Health System (NUHS) and local grassroots organisations collaborate to pilot new strategies to create a built environment that promotes a healthy lifestyle and active and healthy ageing. 
The nearby Alexandra Hospital will also enable medical and healthcare services to be incorporated into the care services for residents.

The blocks in the development will have staggered heights, from six to 40 storeys, and will be orientated to “maximise the views” from their units, said the authorities.
On the side of the development fronting the rail corridor is a stretch of interconnecting rooftop gardens overlooking the canopy of trees. 
FLAT FEATURES
Each CCA unit will be equipped with senior-friendly fittings, including grab bars, wheelchair-accessible bathrooms with slip-resistant flooring and wide wheelchair-friendly main doors.
The flats – with an internal floor area of about 32sqm – come with a built-in wardrobe, cabinets and a furnished kitchen. This will allow seniors to move in quickly with minimum renovations needed.
They are designed with an open layout and come with sliding partitions to separate the living room and bedroom for privacy.

Each CCA unit will be paired with essential services so seniors can live independently with some healthcare assistance when needed. Services include 24-hour emergency monitoring and response, as well as basic health checks.
An onsite manager will help link residents up with relevant care service providers according to their needs. They will also help with simple household fixes.
Seniors who require assistance with daily activities or household services such as meal delivery, laundry and housekeeping can opt-in for these services at additional costs.

People with mental health conditions lack opportunities even as firms try to embrace inclusivity   ,"Despite more companies making efforts, only two in five workers in Singapore feel that their employers provide adequate support for mental well-being.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-inclusivity-employment-lack-opportunities-3027271,"SINGAPORE: Work opportunities for people with mental health conditions may not be easy to come by, but one organisation is helping to train and connect them with employers.   
The Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) MINDSET Learning Hub has coached about 900 people who are at risk of, or recovering from, mental health conditions since it was established six years ago.   
The organisation, a collaboration between MINDSET Care Limited and SAMH, partners with employers in industries such as cleaning, food and beverage, and retail to boost employment opportunities for its trainees.  
However, even as more employers are open to offering positions to these job seekers, there is still a lack of opportunities, especially in white-collar professions, it said.  
















A TEA BAR RUN BY THE DIFFERENTLY-ABLED  
One employer providing jobs for the differently-abled is Hush TeaBar. There, patrons can experience having a silent cup of tea led by the deaf, and supported by persons with mental health conditions.  
Beyond hiring them, the firm – founded by mental health advocate and former Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong – offers benefits such as flexible work arrangements and a trust-based leave system where medical certificates are not required.  
This was particularly important for Hush TeaBar employees like Ms JJ Goh, an engagement and experience curator who is recovering from depression and borderline personality disorder. 
She said that a flexible arrangement helps ease stress and keeps her in the job.  
""I had to quit my initial job during the long-term treatment, and that's kind of unhealthy. I mean, if let's say you were to keep changing jobs, it also kind of adds extra mental health stress,"" she told CNA.  
MEETING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS NOT AN EASY TASK  
However, meeting each employees' spectrum of mental and emotional needs is not an easy task, especially more so for those suffering from mental health or other conditions.  
""Confidence can be lacking generally as a team. Only because they've been marginalised, maybe for a big part of their lives,"" said Ms Ong of her employees.  
""We still have those interpersonal challenges … we are also more emotionally intense,"" she added. ""Understandably, you know, because all of us are a bit more sensitive because of what we've come through … These would be some of the challenges that we have as a team of differently-abled people.""  
Ms Ong, whose own experiences with mental health conditions and the healing process motivated her to set up the tea bar, said she hopes that companies go beyond employment to focus on empowerment.

Steady increase of companies seeking to provide mental health support for employees: Expert







                           hr 
                












To promote self-care and empathy, the tea bar provides counselling sessions to help employees better understand and support each other.  
Mr Low Kok Wah, deaf lead at Hush TeaBar’s department of engagement and experience, told CNA in sign language that the sessions helped colleagues who are hearing-impaired and those who are suffering from mental health conditions see similarities though their differences.  
""I felt more aware of their mental health and started to show my support for them, although the road ahead is rough because of their mental health conditions, just as it is for me, a deaf person."" Mr Low signed.  
MORE FIRMS INTRODUCING WELFARE POLICIES  
With mental well-being increasingly seen as essential for retaining employees and boosting productivity, more companies are introducing welfare policies, said Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of permanent recruitment in Asia Pacific at recruitment company Randstad.  
""Companies are making provisions in the workplace to take a more holistic approach on what it means to employ a person,"" she said. ""To keep (people) engaged and employed and producing wealth over a longer period of time, means that (they) take an active care in (their) personal lives.""  
For instance, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, whose products include sports drink Pocari Sweat, has made working from the office optional for its employees in Singapore, and holds weekly engagement sessions for team leaders to check in on employee morale.  
But despite more companies making efforts, only two in five workers in Singapore feel that their employers provide adequate support for mental well-being, a recent study by the National Council of Social Services found.  
A lack of understanding of what employees really need is likely why workers do not resonate with the benefits provided, said Ms Dass. She recommended engaging professional advisors to address the gap.  
""I think the first thing a company needs to do is maybe get an outside-in approach, where they get consultants or support to basically indicate and help them redesign the benefits that they offer people and what is actually required for mental health support,"" said Ms Dass.  
""It all starts with an education and an understanding of what they're dealing with and how this impacts the employees on a day-to-day basis and the people who surround them.""  
PUSH FOR MORE WORKPLACE INCLUSIVITY   
More companies are gradually making greater efforts to encompass inclusion and diversity in their policymaking and processes to hire those with different needs, said Ms Dass.  
Persons with mental health conditions sometimes find interactions difficult, but many of them are equipped with the skills to contribute in workplaces, said Dr Geraldine Tan, principal psychologist at The Therapy Room.  
""With human relationships or social relationships, they find it a little bit more difficult. But with a lot of understanding from the environment, they blossom, they can contribute because they have the capability and skills,"" said Dr Tan.  
She added she hopes to see the stigma surrounding mental health fade and become a condition that is accommodated by employers and workspaces in Singapore.  
""Imagine if we are able to give them that space and nurture them in our environment or in the work environment,"" she said. ""The amount of work that they can contribute or the level that they can contribute is going to bring so much more benefits to the society and into the organisations,"" she said.

Man to get stern warning for making bomb threat on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/la-andy-hien-duc-man-accused-making-bomb-threat-singapore-airlines-flight-sq33-plead-guilty-3027771,"SINGAPORE: A man will be given a stern warning for making a bomb threat on a Singapore Airlines flight, but will plead guilty to another charge of slapping a man on the same flight.
The prosecution intends to administer a stern warning to La Andy Hien Duc, 37, after reviewing the report from the Institute of Mental Health, the court heard on Thursday (Oct 27).
The charge of using threatening words likely to cause alarm carries a fine of up to S$5,000.
La Andy Hien Duc's lawyer Johannes Hadi told CNA that his client suffers from schizophrenia.
The man will plead guilty in November to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by slapping a man's cheeks on SQ flight SQ33 from San Francisco to Singapore on Sep 28.
The American was originally charged in September with one count each of slapping a man’s cheeks and using threatening words by stating there was a bomb on the flight.
After the alleged bomb threat, the police were alerted and the plane landed safely at Changi Airport under the escort of Republic of Singapore Air Force fighter jets.
Officers from the Airport Police Division and Special Operations Command’s K-9 Unit, as well as the Singapore Armed Forces’ Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group, were mobilised to investigate the threat, which turned out to be false.

“The prices for these three products have not been adjusted since 2020 as part of FairPrice’s ongoing efforts to moderate the cost of living for daily essentials,” it added.
Singapore’s core inflation rose to 5.3 per cent in September, driven mainly by larger increases in the prices of food, services and retail and other goods.
In June, the Government announced a S$1.5 billion support package to counter inflation, providing immediate relief for lower-income and more vulnerable groups.

“Rice is a key staple and basic necessity for most households in Singapore. With the current unprecedented inflation coupled with supply chain disruptions, rising cost of living is a top concern for consumers,” said FairPrice Group CEO Vipul Chawla on Thursday.
“To allay these concerns, FairPrice continues to strengthen our efforts to moderate the cost of living. Our latest price drop applies to rice products that are not only popular, but also products where prices have been kept stable for the past two years to ensure we give exceptional savings to the community.”
FairPrice said it regularly initiates efforts to benchmark prices for daily essentials in Singapore. Earlier this year it provided a 10 per cent discount on four cooking oil products to address concerns on elevated oil prices, as well as providing a special discount for its Pasar fresh eggs for a week in view of rising egg prices.
“This latest initiative complements our earlier efforts this year to drop prices for staples and essentials and we hope this brings some respite to families, empowering them to stretch their dollar further”, said Mr Chawla."
FAQ: Is it safe to store money in apps? Here's what you need to know,"Before putting money in a digital wallet, do you check if the provider is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore? Or read through its terms and conditions? CNA asks lawyers whether you should be doing these things.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/digital-wallets-mobile-apps-money-inside-safe-3014631,"SINGAPORE: As the use of cash declines, it is now common to see people waving their phones at a payment reader or scanning a QR code to pay for a purchase.
For those who don't qualify for credit cards or would rather not use them for contactless payments, digital wallets where users can pre-load funds are a popular option. 
One commonly used option in Singapore is GrabPay, by tech behemoth Grab. Major e-commerce platforms like Shopee, Lazada and Qoo10 also have their own versions of digital wallets.
Mobile app payments that can be linked to credit or debit cards, or have a stored value function to pre-load funds, have been around since e-commerce took off. But the industry saw rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic amid a boom in online shopping and a growing preference for contactless payments.
So much so that they look set to overtake credit cards as the most popular online payment method in Singapore by 2024, according to a report by US financial technology firm FIS that tracked payment trends in 2020.
These apps accounted for 29 per cent of e-commerce transaction value in Singapore last year, up from 20 per cent in 2020, and closing the gap with credit cards which for now retain their lead in market share at 42 per cent, according to FIS' most recent report in 2022.
For in-store purchases, these apps are also growing in popularity as consumers shift away from cash. The industry grew from 11 per cent to 14 per cent of in-store transaction value in 2021, and is expected to hit 23 per cent by 2025.
But are there enough safeguards in place to protect consumers? How safe is your money in these e-wallets? Here's what you need to know:
Q: How are digital wallets regulated in Singapore?
They are regulated under the Payment Services Act, which came into force in early 2020.
Digital wallet providers are required to obtain a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore based on their monthly transaction volumes for regulated activities and size of daily electronic money (e-money) float.
The licensable activities include account issuance, domestic and cross-border money transfer, e-money issuance, digital payment token dealing or exchange and merchant acquisition.
Those with transactions of more than S$3 million a month for any licensable activity, or S$6 billion a month for two or more activities, or hold a daily e-money float of more than S$5 million will be categorised as a major payment institution.
Digital wallet providers who hold the major payment institution licence include GrabPay and ShopeePay.
Those with transaction volumes and e-money float sizes below the above thresholds will have to apply for a standard payment institution licence.

Q: What are the consumer safeguards in place?
Given the scale of their operations and accompanying risk, major payment institutions are subject to more rules than standard payment institutions.
For example, they must comply with requirements to safeguard money received from customers and stored as e-money in digital wallets.
This can either be in the form of an undertaking or a guarantee given by a bank or financial institution in Singapore to be fully liable to the customer for the money. Alternatively, they can deposit customer funds into a trust account maintained by a bank or financial institution here.
“These safeguards are meant to ensure that customers' funds are kept separate from other funds – such as the digital wallet provider's own proprietary funds – and not used for payment of the digital wallet provider's debts,” said Ms Elaine Chan, co-head of financial services regulatory practice at WongPartnership.
Standard payment institutions do not need to adhere to these requirements, although they must disclose this to their customers.
Authorities have previously said the lighter regulation for this category of payment services firms is in line with the smaller scale of operations, as well as to encourage innovation.
Asked if this means one is safer than the other, WongPartnership partner Tian Sion Yoong said: “To the extent that a major payment institution has these regulatory requirements to safeguard customer money, then perhaps it could be seen as ‘safer’ in that sense.”
But a standard payment institution may decide to put in place these safeguards despite not being mandatory, he added.
Consumers who have concerns should check directly with the institutions about what is being done to safeguard customers' money, said Mr Tian, who is a partner at the law firm’s financial services regulatory and financial technology practices.
Other experts noted that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has a “stringent” process when assessing applications, be it major or standard payment institutions, thereby ensuring that only those who meet its standards get awarded a licence.
Applicants are required to submit detailed information on their policies regarding consumer protection, cybersecurity, anti-money laundering and others. They then go through several tests and simulations conducted by the regulator, said Mr Leong Chuo Ming, partner at Withers KhattarWong.
“The application process is actually quite brutal because MAS really wants to make sure these providers know what they are doing,” he added.
Other safeguards include e-wallet providers being barred from providing cash withdrawal services and having a cap of S$5,000 on the amount of funds that can be stored in these digital wallets.
These are partly intended to protect users, as well as ensuring stability of the overall financial system and deter money laundering, said Ms Etelka Bogardi, financial services regulatory partner at Norton Rose Fulbright.
Q: Some digital wallet providers have a clause that says users may not be able to recover their money if the business fails. Should I be worried?
No, according to experts that CNA spoke to.
Mr Leong described the clause as a “standard” inclusion in the terms and conditions as a way to protect a business from “as much unforeseen circumstances as possible”. 
Ms Bogardi echoed that the clause lays out the worst-case scenario, and is no different from risk disclosure statements found in other types of service agreements.
And should a major payment institution become insolvent, the regulatory safeguards will kick in to allow a better prospect of recovery, the lawyers said.
For example, if there was an undertaking or guarantee from a bank, customers may seek to recover their funds from the bank, said Mr Daniel Liu, partner at WongPartnership’s restructuring and insolvency and special situations advisory practices.
And if the customer funds have been deposited into a valid trust account, these funds would be considered ""ringfenced"" and not part of the company’s assets for liquidation.
“In terms of ownership, they would belong to the customer,” Mr Liu said, adding that as part of the legal process, customers will have to file a proof of debt with the liquidator.
“It will take some time because the liquidators need to take control of the affairs of the company and understand what's going on. But if a valid trust has been declared over the customer’s funds, that customer will likely be able to get his or her money back.”

But your recovery prospects are less optimistic when a non-major payment institution runs into financial woes, since user protection requirements are not mandatory.
When a business is wound up, its assets – including customers' funds – are liquidated. If no consumer safeguards are in place, secured creditors will be paid first, followed by other preferential debt such as the liquidator’s fees and employees' wages.
Customers would fall into the category of unsecured creditors and will rank equally as other unsecured creditors. This group may then receive a proportionate distribution of the remaining assets based on the amount they are owed, said Mr Liu, adding that chances for a full recovery are minimal.
That said, FIS noted that the risk of customers losing their money due to a sudden exit by a provider in Singapore is “very low”. 
This is due to the stringent rules put in place by authorities as part of the Payment Services Act and the fact that an overwhelming majority of non-bank wallet providers in Singapore are “major corporations linked to big tech, regional super apps and the like”, said Ms Yvonne Szeto, vice-president of commercial for Asia-Pacific at Worldpay from FIS.
Q: What should customers look out for when using a digital wallet?
Still, it never hurts to be a prudent consumer.
A key thing to do, according to experts, would be to check if a digital wallet provider is licensed by the MAS.
This can be done via the financial institution directory on MAS’ website, which shows a provider’s licence type and activities they are authorised to provide. Consumers should also check and avoid any service provider that has been placed on the MAS' investor alert list, said Mr Tian.
“Any digital wallet operator that misrepresents itself as being licensed or regulated by MAS when it is not, may not be reliable and could be a scam,” he said.
While the terms and conditions of service agreements aren’t exactly page-turners, users should try to read them before clicking “I agree”. In particular, look out for details about the safeguarding of customer funds in the event of an insolvency, which are typically included in these agreements.
“If there isn’t anything in there about how they are safeguarding the funds, then that’s a question mark,” said Ms Chan.
Mr Leong cautioned against putting more funds than what is needed into a digital wallet.
“Don’t use it as a bank account. That’s not what it’s meant for,” he said.
He also advised staying vigilant against phishing scams, which remain “one of the main risks” for digital wallet users.
In cases that have happened in Singapore, scammers would deceive victims into giving up their personal details, banking credentials and one-time password. The scammers would then use this information to apply for e-wallets and make unauthorised transactions.
The police in January issued a warning about the re-emergence of such phishing scams.

"Singapore, Malaysia can transfer double the amount of electricity to each other after upgrade of interconnectors",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-malaysia-electricity-clean-energy-interconnectors-3026961,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and Malaysia can now transfer double the amount of electricity to each other following the upgrading of the electricity interconnectors between both countries, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said on Wednesday (Oct 26).
The new interconnectors can now accommodate bidirectional electricity flows of about 1,000 megawatts between the two countries.
The interconnector is also being used to import power from Laos under the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which began in June this year. 
Electricity interconnectors are high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries so that excess power from wind and solar farms, for instance, can be shared and traded.
“This is another important milestone in enhancing regional energy connectivity, and will facilitate future import trials around our region,” Dr Tan said during a speech at the Asia Clean Energy Summit, as part of the Singapore International Energy Week at Marina Bay Sands.
The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore project serves as an important “pathfinder” to advance regional interconnectivity, underpinned by the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) Power Grid vision, Dr Tan said.
He added that the four countries look forward to further discussions on enhancements and future plans to support continued multilateral power trades in the region.
FACILITATING CLEAN ENERGY TRADE
Dr Tan, who is also Manpower Minister, spoke about how governments should work together to establish regulatory frameworks, infrastructure and the ecosystem, to facilitate clean energy trade in the region.
This will also provide more assurance for cross-border energy trade and enhance regional connectivity, he said. 
Countries should conduct trials and pilots to gain insights on clean energy trade, as well as upgrade infrastructure to facilitate these projects.
He added that countries in the region should also provide infrastructure project opportunities to accelerate clean energy development and trade. The Energy Market Authority, for instance, has launched requests for proposals for electricity import projects from the region, he said.
Singapore has received more than 20 proposals to import electricity from five countries – Australia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, he said, adding that the country remains on track to meet its imports target of 4 gigawatts by 2035. 
“Prospective importers are keen to work with companies in the region to co-develop projects which can also serve the domestic demand of source countries,” he said.
He added that the region and global community should work together to plan and implement energy transition towards a shared future. 
“The clean energy transition is challenging, especially as we are also grappling with a global energy crisis. No one country can do it alone, and we need to work together to advance our collective interest,” he said. 
Beyond regional and international meetings held regularly to discuss and develop solutions to a shared energy crisis, countries need to strengthen collaborations bilaterally and multilaterally to achieve concrete progress on clean energy projects, Dr Tan said.
He pointed to various partnerships that Singapore has entered into, highlighting recent agreements with Australia, Vietnam, Laos, Brunei and most recently, Cambodia.
Dr Tan said that having cross-border trade of clean energy can help to make regional projects more commercially viable.
“We are a diverse collection of countries with varying capacities to generate and pay for clean energy. Having a wider base of consumers willing to offtake clean energy can provide the base demand and improve a project’s financing options,” he said.
A REGIONAL POWER GRID
Dr Tan also said that countries will need to explore innovative business models to boost the commercial viability of clean energy trade projects. 
“These models need to address how we can better enhance regional grid connectivity, strengthen regional energy security and resiliency, and unlock investments in renewable energy and employment opportunities in the source countries,” he said.
“In particular, given the intense global demand for subsea cables and electricity imports infrastructure, it will be important to explore both the longer-term provision of regional operations and maintenance capabilities and the anchoring of subsea cable manufacturing facilities in the region.”

To advance its understanding, Singapore is partnering with the United States on a feasibility study on regional energy connectivity in Southeast Asia, Dr Tan said.
“It will assess the benefits, technical feasibility, and economic viability of developing a regional power grid network comprising both land and sea-based interconnections in Southeast Asia,” he said.
He added that the study will also propose possible forms of such a regional network, taking into consideration implemented and planned connections, as well as other possible connections involving regional countries.
""This will help to facilitate clean energy trade projects in the region, which can spur further investments,"" said Dr Tan.
""The study will be part of the Net Zero World Initiative led by the US, which the US plans to work hand in hand with Singapore and Southeast Asian partners to co-create and implement highly tailored, actionable technical and investment plans to support energy decarbonisation in the region."""

Singapore to invest additional S$165 million in food security programme: DPM Heng,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-food-security-investment-dpm-heng-3026951,"SINGAPORE: A food security programme led by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) will receive an additional S$165 million in funding, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Wednesday (Oct 26).
Launched in 2019 with an initial investment of S$144 million, the Singapore Food Story R&D Programme supports Singapore's 30 by 30 goal – a push for the country to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.
The additional investment brings the total amount committed to the programme to more than S$300 million.
""The significant step-up in investment is an expression of our commitment to food security, and our belief in the value and potential of the agri-food sector,"" Mr Heng said during a speech at the Singapore International Agri-Food Week gala dinner at Gardens by the Bay.
The Singapore Food Story programme was launched with an initial focus on aquaculture, urban agriculture, future foods and food safety. The additional investment will see its scope expanded.
""First, we will build new capabilities to expand the range of foods that our farms produce,"" said Mr Heng, who is also the Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies.
""Currently, our farms produce mainly leafy vegetables, eggs and fish. We will expand the foods produced to include more fruited vegetables and crustaceans.
""Soon, I hope prawn mee with mostly Singapore-produced ingredients could be a common sight in our hawker stalls.""

Through genetics and breeding of agri-inputs such as fish fry and seeds, the programme will also seek to improve productivity and nutritional qualities while increasing resistance to disease and climate change, Mr Heng said.
""Take fish for example. We are looking to develop superior fingerlings suited for tropical aquaculture that can contribute to a 30 per cent increase in farming productivity,"" he said.
""We are also seeking to reduce fish mortality from common fish diseases from the present 70 per cent to 100 per cent, to between 20 per cent (and) 50 per cent.""
The programme will also deepen Singapore's capabilities to be an innovation node for future foods, Mr Heng said.
""Alternative protein is a promising area to meet Singapore's food and nutrition needs in an urban environment,"" he said, noting that Singapore was the first jurisdiction in the world to grant regulatory approval for the sale of cultured meat.
""We will be developing new analytical methods for food safety assessment, which can better deal with unexpected hazards in food innovation without requiring lengthy testing,"" Mr Heng added.
""This will provide an important foundation for the innovation of future foods in Singapore.""

Mr Heng said that research and development efforts in Singapore would also contribute to the food needs of the region and the world.
To illustrate this, he used the examples of rice, dairy products and alternative proteins to represent traditional, modern and future foods respectively.
He highlighted how the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory is working on making rice cultivation more sustainable, while Singapore-based companies like Oatside and WhatIF Foods have created plant-based milk alternatives.
He also discussed the work of local companies such as Shiok Meats, Esco Aster and Next Gen Foods.
""Alternative proteins are potentially more sustainable compared to traditional cattle and poultry farming, consuming much less water and arable land, with a smaller carbon footprint,"" Mr Heng said.
Concluding his speech, Mr Heng said that agri-tech and food-tech remains a bright spot, although the global food challenge has become more pressing.
""Singapore is keen to do our part, for ourselves and the region,"" he said.
""We are doubling down on the Singapore Food Story to strengthen our food resilience goals.

"Man posed as pimp, 'lingerie consultant' to lure women into giving him sex acts and sending pictures, videos",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-posed-pimp-lingerie-consultant-tricked-women-sex-acts-pictures-videos-3026486,"SINGAPORE: Over about four years, a married man targeted five women into sending him sexually explicit pictures and videos by posing as a pimp from a prostitution ring or the boss of a lingerie business.
One victim, who told him she was in debt and needed money, wound up doing sex work and was tricked into having sex with him. 
Muhammad Nazri Sapar, 32, pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Oct 26) to 15 charges, including cheating by personation, criminal intimidation and extortion.
Another 31 charges will be considered in sentencing, which was adjourned to November.
The court heard that Nazri carried out the crimes between November 2014 and April 2018 on five women who were aged between 19 and 33 at the time.
He had two schemes to get free sexual services and sexually explicit pictures and videos from Malay women, whom he specifically targeted, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Ying Min.
The first was his fake persona as a pimp in a prostitution ring. He created a Facebook account in 2014 posing as a woman, using photos he got online.
In November 2014, he added a 19-year-old woman on Facebook. The victim told him she was in debt and needed money, and he suggested that she work as a sex worker.
He said a ""Nurul Huda"" would contact her, and texted the victim posing as Nurul Huda, claiming she was a sex worker in a prostitution ring.
Nurul Huda told the victim about working as a sex worker and said the victim would have to send nude photos to join the ring. The victim would also have to let the pimp try her sexual services, he said.
The victim agreed and sent nude photographs of herself to the pimp, which was really Nazri.
She subsequently joined the concocted prostitution ring, and Nazri arranged for clients for her. The victim worked as a sex worker from November 2014 and April 2015.
According to Nurul Huda's instructions, she charged S$50 for oral sex and S$100 for sex, and was allowed to keep all of her earnings.
In exchange, Nazri would ask her for photos and videos of her sexual engagements with clients. The victim estimated that she sent Nazri more than 20 photos and fewer than 10 videos during the six months.
In April 2015, Nazri realised that the victim had stopped her sex work. He posed as Nurul Huda and told the victim that the pimp was disappointed that she had stopped without informing him.
He told the victim that she had to have a session with the pimp in order to exit the industry. The victim agreed and had sex with Nazri.
Over about three years after this, Nazri sent a series of threatening and harassing emails to the victim. He sent her compromising photos of her and threatened to post them online, to let her family know she was involved in sex work, or to get her sister involved in such work.
He told the victim to do any of the following if she did not want him to make good on his threats: To find new girls for him, record herself having sex with other men and send him the footage, be a sex worker, send him nudes daily or be his mistress.
Initially, the victim tried to find new girls for Nazri. When she failed, she opted to be his mistress instead. However, Nazri ""remained unsatisfied"" and the victim eventually sent him photos of herself performing sex acts on other men. 
Despite this, Nazri continued to threaten her so he could get more of such photos and videos. The victim eventually reported the matter to the police in April 2017.
As a second modus operandi, Nazri posed as a female lingerie consultant who was purportedly trained overseas. He made Facebook posts saying he was urgently looking for a personal assistant.
He advertised attractive working conditions and remuneration, with a starting pay of S$2,500 for a home-based job with flexible hours.
As part of the selection process, Nazri asked the applicants to send him photographs and videos of themselves in underwear and claimed to be an expert in female health.
One woman was tricked into sending him 59 videos and 87 photos from September 2017 to January 2018.
A SCAM FOR FREE SEX: PROSECUTOR
The prosecution sought 11 to 13 years' jail and three to six strokes of the cane for Nazri.
Ms Lim said Nazri's ""multi-faceted and multi-victim scheme was essentially a scam for free sexual services and sexually explicit material"".
He wove an ""elaborate tale of operating a prostitution ring"", conjuring fictitious characters and posing as them at various points, she said.
When the victims ""expressed reticence or hesitation"", Nazri would lie that they were about to get the job over other potential candidates. He also manipulated his existing victims into looking for further potential victims for him, said Ms Lim.
She said Nazri's culpability was at the highest level as he acted with clear premeditation and showed no remorse or doubt when going about ""his spree of offending behaviour"".
He will return to court for sentencing on Nov 16."

Mohamad Fazli Mohamad Salleh added in a Facebook post that he has asked for upgrading works at the other zones to be expedited. 
Enhancements are also being carried out at Bangunan Sultan Iskandar's arrival bus halls.
""Some of the automated clearance lanes are undergoing replacement and installation works,"" ICA said on Oct 19, adding that those lanes would not be operational from Oct 16 until Nov 10.

It did not specify how many automated clearance lanes would be available."
Can Singapore achieve its e-sports hub ambitions?,"Singapore is currently hosting one of the biggest video gaming tournaments in the world in The International, a Dota 2 championship event.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/esports-singapore-challenges-global-hub-ambition-sportsg-business-3026386,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore pursues its ambition of becoming a global e-sports hub, agencies here are cautioning industry players against getting carried away.
Local sports governing body Sport Singapore (SportSG) wants e-sports firms to first properly consider the suitability of housing certain business functions here.
It also sees the need for e-sports activities to be conducted responsibly, with consideration for the detrimental effects of overplaying.
Singapore is making strides in the fast-growing e-sports scene, seeking to host more events in hopes of becoming a top sporting venue.
















But challenges remain as foreign e-sports teams - which could share their expertise and train the next generation of players here - still find it hard to break into the local e-sports scene, citing high financial barriers of entry.
CHALLENGES REMAIN
Despite Singapore’s efforts to position its e-sports enterprises as credible partners for global organisations keen to host e-sports events in Asia, some industry players are balking at the high costs of doing business here.
Europe-based OG Esports’ chief executive officer JMR Luna said Singapore has the resources and capabilities to grow its e-sports scene, citing its higher income population, better infrastructure and stable government, compared to other countries in the region.
However, the city-state could be friendlier to foreign e-sport companies exploring their options here, he said.
""If they become very protectionist about their own companies, then a company like mine will never be able to come.”

Mr Luna noted that there are not many European e-sports companies in Singapore now, and that the larger players are all local firms.
Mr Dean Tan, division head for ecosystem development and industry development in SportSG's Technology and Innovation Group, urged e-sports firms to properly consider where to best house certain functions of their businesses, when considering whether to enter the Singapore market.
“We see opportunities for design and development, research and development (and) such functions to be housed in Singapore,” he said.
“I would encourage some of these companies to continue to rationalise what are the key executive functions that make sense to be based in Singapore, as compared to other functions that could probably be based in other countries.""
While e-sports can draw visitors from abroad, Mr Tan noted that such events and activities should be held in a responsible manner, including being mindful of the detrimental effects of overplaying and over-training.

GRABBING A SLICE OF THE PIE
Singapore has been eager to capture a slice of the growing e-sports market, as part of efforts to cement its status as a top global sporting venue.
The industry's revenue grew from US$996 million globally in 2020 to US$1.14 billion last year, according to market research firm Newzoo, with the figure projected to hit US$1.38 billion this year.
Singapore laid out its ambitions back in August 2020, with the creation of the Singapore Games Association, which aims to develop the local games and e-sports ecosystem by building a strong Singaporean core, and serving as a voice for the local e-sports community.

SportSG’s Mr Tan said the plan to host more events here goes beyond just e-sports itself, and applies to traditional sports too.
""I think we are always looking out for events that can uplift the social and the sporting economic outcomes for Singapore,” he said.
ATTRACTING A GLOBAL AUDIENCE
While SportSG said it is looking to hold more e-sports events here, such as virtual boxing and other video games, key stakeholders in the sector have also highlighted other benefits.
Singapore is currently hosting one of the biggest video gaming tournaments in the world in The International, an annual multi-million dollar Dota 2 world championship event. Last year’s edition saw players competing for more than US$40 million in total prize money.
This year, the tournament is being held in Singapore for the first time, with playoffs taking place earlier in October while the Singapore Indoor Stadium will host the grand finals this coming weekend.
Mr Roy Kek, chief executive officer and co-founder of EMERGE Esports, a Singapore-based professional gaming and e-sports talent management firm, said spectators have come from around the world to watch the tournament, giving a boost to local tourism and businesses.
""We don't just have Singaporeans who attend our events. We also have many foreigners who came down as well,” he said.
He added that hosting such a major event would hopefully provide a sense of pride and ownership to Singaporeans - and generate hype comparable to other key sports events such as the Olympic Games."
Man who paid S$1 million to company in hope of getting Singapore PR sentenced to jail for lying to MOM,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-1-million-company-singapore-pr-jail-lying-mom-3026321,"SINGAPORE: Hoping to obtain Singapore permanent residency so he could work in the country and his children could live here, a man paid S$1 million to a company after being asked to do so as an “investment”.
He then submitted false information to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to get an Employment Pass.
Yu Huajie, a 37-year-old China national, was given seven weeks’ jail on Wednesday (Oct 26). He pleaded guilty to two charges of making false statements in his declaration for an Employment Pass. Another two charges were taken into consideration.
The court heard that Yu wanted to settle down and legalise his stay in Singapore in 2018. He approached a man in China known only as “Bing Bing” for help.
Bing Bing told Yu that Yu could acquire an Employment Pass in Singapore by investing S$1 million into a company in Singapore.
Yu agreed as he hoped that the pass would subsequently help him to achieve permanent residency in Singapore, enabling him to establish companies in the country and allowing his children to live and study in Singapore.
Yu transferred S$1 million to Bing Bing in end-2018. According to the agreement, Yu was to apply for an Employment Pass under the company Gashubin Engineering.
Gashubin was purportedly in the business of water and gas pipeline and sewer construction.
On paper, he would be paid S$10,000 per month as a salary, on top of any future potential investment returns.
The S$1 million he paid was to go to Gashubin, the court heard. However, in reality, Yu would not do any work for the firm.
Yu was told that a degree certificate issued by an American university would have to be processed and submitted as part of his Employment Pass application. He paid US$10,000 for the fake certificate, despite never studying at the university.
In December 2018, Yu’s application for an Employment Pass under Gashubin was submitted to the Controller of Work Passes at MOM.
In the application, he was purportedly a regional marketing manager under Gashubin, with a bachelor’s degree in business management from The Chubb Institute (Westbury).
He made two false statements to MOM in February 2019, reaffirming details of the application. Based on the false information given, Yu’s Employment Pass was approved.
The ruse was uncovered after MOM received information on the possible contravention of the law in March 2021.
Investigations revealed that the director of Gashubin was approached by the director of a company called Hai Sin International, which “specialised” in helping foreigners obtain PR status in Singapore.
Hai Sin was purportedly in the business of assisting its clients to buy over, invest in or start businesses in Singapore. Hai Sin would embark on advertising programs in China to persuade foreigners to invest in Singapore.
Hai Sin’s director, Wang Jue, approached Gashubin’s director in mid-2018 with a proposal. She said she could secure foreign investors for Gashubin if Gashubin applied for Employment Passes for the investors to stay in Singapore, according to court documents.
They agreed that the foreign investors would invest financially in Gashubin and would not be required to perform any work for Gashubin in Singapore, despite Gashubin being their official employer.
Yu was allowed to defer his sentence to November.
According to court documents, Yu is currently not a Singapore permanent resident."
UOB offers 200 flexi-work jobs for women with caregiving duties ,"The initiative is an expansion of UOB’s gig employment programme, which was first rolled out in November last year to provide flexible work for its retired employees.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/uob-flexi-work-jobs-women-caregiving-duties-expands-gig-employment-programme-3026226,"SINGAPORE: UOB said on Wednesday (Oct 26) that it is offering 200 jobs in Singapore with flexible work arrangements for women with parental and caregiving duties.
The jobs comprise full-time and part-time roles and gig work at the bank’s various business units, such as front-line bank branch operations, corporate functions and back-end operations.
The initiative is an expansion of UOB’s gig employment programme which was first rolled out in November last year to provide flexible work for its retired employees.
According to the bank, jobs under the initiative are “specially catered” to the needs of women who require more flexibility at work due to familial responsibilities, such as mothers with newborn children or women who have to shoulder elderly caregiving responsibilities at home.
Working hours can be adjusted based on needs. This means that women can take up permanent half-day work arrangements, work full- or part-time based on hours of their choice, or opt for project-based gig work.
Both full- and part-timers under this programme will receive “equal pay” and enjoy the same benefits, such as leave entitlements and medical insurance coverage, as their peers with similar roles in the bank.
Salaries for part-timers will be “based off the full-time salary of the role, adjusted to the number of hours they work”, Mr Dean Tong, UOB’s head of group human resources, told CNA.
Gig workers will be paid on an hourly or project basis.
New hires will also get to embark on a programme with Mums@Work - a career portal that pairs women looking for flexi-work with potential employers - which will prepare them for their return to the workplace.
Positions available at the moment include service associate at the bank's money-changing counter, project management analyst and a cloud engineer manager. More jobs will be added to the bank's portal progressively.
“Women should be encouraged, not penalised, for supporting the needs of their families while pursuing their careers,” Mr Tong said. “UOB is proud to partner our female colleagues in their journey to achieve balance between their careers and personal lives, and excelling on both fronts.”
Men with caregiving responsibilities are also welcome to apply for these roles, he told CNA.

Temasek-backed tech venture launches new rewards platform for everyday shopping,"Members of yuu Rewards Club can earn one point for every dollar spent at more than 1,000 participating places, including Cold Storage and Giant supermarkets. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/yuu-rewards-club-cold-storage-giant-7-11-singapore-zoo-singtel-dbs-3025836,"SINGAPORE: With a new rewards platform launching on Thursday (Oct 27), shoppers in Singapore could soon use a single app to redeem rewards on everyday spending at Cold Storage, Giant, Guardian, Singtel and BreadTalk Group F&B outlets.
The yuu Rewards Club is a free platform created by minden.ai, a tech venture founded and backed by Temasek. 
DFI Retail Group, which operates Cold Storage, Giant and CS Fresh supermarkets as well as the Guardian and 7-Eleven outlets, also has a stake in the venture. 
On the platform, members can earn 1 yuu point for every dollar spent at the more than 1,000 participating places, said minden.ai in a press release on Wednesday. 
Every 200 yuu points can be used to offset S$1 on purchases at participating outlets, said CEO of minden.ai Sng Ren Yeong. 
The points can also be used to redeem deals and rewards from the participating brands. 
For example, 10 yuu points could net you a small hot coffee at Toast Box. Individuals who opt to save up for bigger redemptions could use 2,400 yuu points to redeem a free month of HBO Go subscription with Singtel. 
There will be no cap to the number of yuu points that can be accumulated.

“The yuu Rewards Club was created to give consumers greater choice, convenience and flexibility, such that we can reward them for their everyday purchases,” said Mr Sng. 
“We hope to allow consumers to accumulate and earn points as they shop everyday purchases and be able to redeem them for meaningful rewards across this network,” he added.
According to a survey of 1,000 Singapore residents, 60 per cent of them said they were increasingly looking to join a loyalty or rewards programme to save money, said minden.ai in a press release. 
“It is also opportune that this platform addresses the everyday purchase habits for consumers, and we are happy that we are doing our part today to help consumers stretch their dollar to offset some of the inflationary pressures that they face in today’s inflationary environment,” said Mr Sng. 
72 per cent of respondents were looking for cost savings on purchases, and two-thirds of respondents wanted the ability to redeem points on everyday spending, the survey showed. 
















Participating outlets and brands include Cold Storage, CS Fresh and Giant supermarkets, Guardian and 7-Eleven outlets. The yuu platform can also be used at the Mandai Wildlife Reserve parks - the Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari, River Wonders and Jurong Bird Park. 
Members can also earn yuu points at BreadTalk, Toast Box, Food Junction, Food Republic, Food Opera, Butter Bean and Thye Moh Chan, as well as on Singtel products. 
There are also offers specific to each brand. For example, if customers use the yuu platform at Giant, they could redeem offers like double the number of points on fresh vegetables and fruits, laundry items, rice, milk and cream, and triple the points on Meadows brand items. 
All of these offers can be stacked in the same transaction, and will automatically apply when individuals shop at the participating outlets, said Mr Sng. 
“We are happy to welcome more partners to come on board. Today we have some of Singaporeans’ favourite household brands that really are very consumer-centric in prioritising to reward their consumers. We hope to welcome more brands in time to come that equally focus on consumers as well,” said Mr Sng.

To start earning yuu points, consumers need to download the yuu app, which is now available on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Huawei App Store. 
After they register for their yuu account, they will have a unique ID. Before paying at participating partners, they should scan their unique QR code or barcode. Members can see their point balance on the app and use the points to offset purchases or redeem rewards. 
Cashiers at the participating outlets have been trained to assist consumers who may be interested in joining the platform, said Mr Sng. 
Responding to a question on why minden.ai opted to focus on rewards and offers over cashback, Mr Sng noted that different consumers have different preferences. 
“Some consumers prefer cashback discounts, others prefer to accumulate and earn points so they can redeem it for meaningful rewards,” he said. 
“You may use your points to offset purchases, but if you save and accumulate them to a certain amount, you may find a reward for which there’s a big discount for, that you can redeem your points for,” he added. 
When brands know about the demand for such rewards, they may also be able to purchase them at a cheaper price or deliver these items at a greater scale, he added.

As customers interact with the platform over time, minden.ai hopes to leverage technology to personalise the rewards, said Mr Sng. 
“If we understand both the consumer preferences as well as what’s available within our partner inventory network, they can reward the consumers in a much more meaningful way by making the rewards not only relevant but rewarding as well,” he added. 
minden.ai has also partnered with DBS and PAssion Card on the platform. 
DBS will launch a new DBS yuu credit card on Thursday, and these users can earn up to 30 times the points when they shop and make payment with this card at partner stores. 
Individuals who have a PAssion card or PAssion POSB debit card can also link their cards to the platform. Spending with the debit card or tapping the PAssion card at DFI outlets also earns yuu points. 
After accumulating yuu points, members can also choose to donate them to community projects and charitable causes such as PAssion CARES, a pay-it-forward initiative driven by the People’s Association via the yuu app, said minden.ai in the press release."
Bringing home a luxury item bought overseas? 5 things you need to take note of,"Arriving travellers, both foreigners and returning residents, will have to pay GST if the total value of the item exceeds the relief amount granted to them.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/luxury-items-travel-gst-relief-customs-declaration-3025986,"SINGAPORE: Last week, Taiwanese celebrity and make-up artist Xiao Kai, whose real name is Chang Ching-kai, took to social media to share an ""unpleasant"" encounter he had at Singapore's Changi Airport. 
In a live video on Instagram, Xiao Kai said he was asked by Singapore Customs officers to pay tax for his used luxury bag when he arrived at the airport.
The celebrity alleged in Mandarin that he was asked to show a receipt for his Celine bag, which he was unable to because he had purchased it in Taipei in September.
Xiao Kai added that the officers told him that the bag was considered new as it was purchased in the last three months. He ended up paying a tax of 7 per cent of its sale price, which he said was about NT$50,000 (S$2,205).
On Tuesday (Oct 25), a spokesperson from the Singapore Customs told CNA that the agency has contacted Xiao Kai to understand the circumstances of his case. 
Singapore Customs added that officers at the checkpoints will ""assess the specifics of each case, such as the condition of the goods presented, to ascertain whether the goods are liable for GST (Goods and Services Tax) payment"". 
Here are five things you should take note of when you are bringing back a luxury item bought overseas.
Do I have to pay GST?
GST is a consumption tax levied on the import of goods, as well as all supplies of goods and services in Singapore. All goods brought into Singapore are subject to 7 per cent GST. 
Arriving travellers, both foreigners and returning residents, must pay GST on the total value of items that exceeds the GST import relief amount granted to them.
""This is applicable whether the goods were purchased overseas or whether foreign taxes were paid,"" said a Customs spokesperson.
Goods granted GST import relief include new articles, souvenirs, gifts and food preparations intended for the traveller’s personal use or consumption, according to the Customs website.
The relief amount is based on the duration that the person has spent outside of Singapore:





Time spent away from Singapore
Value of goods granted GST relief
48 hours or more
S$500
Less than 48 hours
S$100






For example, if you are travelling out of Singapore for a week and you bought a luxury bag for S$10,000 intended for personal use, your bag will be subject to GST payment.
You will be required to pay 7 per cent GST on the excess S$9,500 (i.e. S$10,000 minus the S$500 for which you are eligible for GST relief). 
If sales receipts are unavailable, the value will be based on the transacted amount of identical or similar items from the country they were purchased in or the original price if they were sold for export to Singapore, inclusive of shipping charges.
You may make an advance declaration and pay GST using Customs@SG web application. Alternatively, you can declare and pay at the Customs tax payment office.
When am I exempted from paying GST?
You are exempted from paying GST when the value of your items is lower than the granted GST relief.
The GST import relief does not apply to intoxicating liquor and tobacco, as well as goods imported for commercial purposes.
Holders of a work permit, employment pass, student pass, dependent pass or long-term pass issued by the Singapore Government, and airline crew members are not entitled to GST import relief.
If I am bringing in used personal items, am I still required to declare them?
For used personal items such as used clothing, shoes, bags and toiletries, travellers are not required to declare and pay GST on them, said a Customs spokesperson to CNA.
This is because GST relief may also be granted on used articles and personal belongings bought in reasonable quantities for personal use. 
However, officers at the checkpoints will assess each case, including the condition of the items, to decide whether the goods are liable for GST payment.
What happens if I am caught not declaring my items? 
Importers may be penalised if they do not comply with the requirements imposed under the Customs Act and the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA).
It is an offence to not declare or make an incorrect or incomplete declaration on the value of goods imported into or manufactured in Singapore for the purpose of assessment of duty or GST.
Those found guilty may be fined up to S$10,000, or the equivalent of the amount of the customs duty, excise duty or GST payable, whichever is the greater amount. They could also be jailed up to 12 months, or both. 
If I bought a luxury bag from a duty-free shop in Changi Airport while leaving for my holiday, will I be taxed on the way back?
If you have purchased items from a duty-free shop at Changi Airport before your flight out of Singapore, you have to pay GST on the way back if the cost exceeds your GST relief amount.
Editor's note: The original version of the story said that Xiao Kai paid tax of about NT$50,000 for his bag. It should be that he paid tax of 7 per cent of its sale price of about NT$50,000. We apologise for the error.

Retail investors to take risk test before cryptocurrency trading as part of proposed rules by MAS,"Borrowing to buy cryptocurrencies may be disallowed, as the Monetary Authority of Singapore warns that crypto trading is “highly risky and not suitable for the general public”.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cryptocurrency-trading-rules-retail-investors-risk-awareness-test-monetary-authority-singapore-stablecoins-3025996,"SINGAPORE: Retail investors in Singapore may have to go through a risk awareness assessment before being allowed to trade cryptocurrencies.
They will also not be able to use credit cards or any form of borrowing to trade cryptocurrencies.
These are among the measures proposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to protect retail consumers, in one of two consultation papers published on Wednesday (Oct 26).
The Singapore central bank has repeatedly warned the public against investing in cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, it prohibited cryptocurrency trading service providers from taking up public advertisements and engaging third parties like social media influencers.
Trading in cryptocurrencies, also known as digital payment tokens (DPTs), is “highly risky and not suitable for the general public”, the MAS reiterated in a media release on Wednesday. But it noted that as cryptocurrencies play a supporting role in the broader digital asset ecosystem, it “would not be feasible to ban them”.
“Therefore, to reduce the risk to consumers from speculative trading in cryptocurrencies, MAS will require that DPT service providers ensure proper business conduct and adequate risk disclosure,” it said.
The regulator, in its other consultation paper, also proposed new requirements around so-called stablecoins, which came under the spotlight after the collapse of TerraUSD sent shockwaves through the digital assets markets.
These include having secure reserve assets as backing and adequate disclosures.
REDUCING CONSUMER RISKS
The proposed rules to protect retail investors cover three main areas:
Consumer Access
DPT service providers will be required to provide relevant risk disclosures to allow retail customers to make informed decisions regarding cryptocurrency trading. A risk awareness assessment is also being proposed to ensure that retail customers have sufficient knowledge of the risks involved.
MAS noted that a number of industry players are supportive of some form of retail investor assessment and have expressed interest to work together to develop a common assessment template. Having a common template would facilitate consistency and robustness across the industry, it added.
In addition, DPT service providers will not be allowed to offer any monetary or non-monetary incentives to retail customers upon sign-up, or to any person to encourage referrals of its service.
They must also disallow the use of credit facilities and leverage by retail consumers for cryptocurrency trading.
Business Conduct
DPT service providers will be required to implement proper segregation of customers’ assets from its own assets.
MAS said the recent failure of several firms in the industry underscores the importance of DPT service providers having effective and robust arrangements for the identification and segregation of customers’ assets. 
“In addition to minimising the risk of loss or misuse of customers’ assets during the ordinary course of business, these arrangements facilitate the return of customers’ assets in the event of … insolvency,” it wrote in the consultation paper.
Firms will also have to mitigate any potential conflicts of interest which arise from the multiple roles they perform, and establish processes for complaints handling.
Technology Risks
Similar to other financial institutions such as banks, DPT service providers will be required to maintain high availability and recoverability of their critical systems.

Singapore says retail investors seem 'irrationally oblivious' to crypto risks, plans tougher rules













In its consultation paper, MAS said that despite its consistent warnings about the hazards of cryptocurrency speculation, cryptocurrencies continue to attract “much speculative consumer interest”.
This is partly due to alleged “success stories” of spectacular gains made over a short period of time and celebrity endorsements that encouraged retail participation. 
A significant part of the public discourse, usually through promotional activities and social media posts, also “irresponsibly draws little attention to the inherent risks of DPTs”, it said, citing the earlier collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD.
The regulator concluded that it is hence appropriate to put in place “targeted regulatory measures” to address the risks posed to Singapore consumers.
“Notwithstanding these regulatory measures, consumers must continue to exercise utmost caution when trading in DPTs and must take responsibility for such trading,” MAS said, adding that regulations “cannot protect consumers from losses arising from the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of DPT trading”.

ENSURING ""CREDIBLE"" STABLECOINS
While extreme price volatility has ruled out cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange for transactions in the digital asset ecosystem, stablecoins hold such potential if they are well-regulated and securely backed, according to the MAS.
A stablecoin is a crypto-asset designed to have a stable value, typically by being backed or pegged to an underlying asset such as a currency.
Currently, stablecoins and its service providers fall under the Payment Services Act and are regulated primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing, as well as technology risks. But this is “not adequate”, MAS wrote in its consultation paper, as it does not regulate the promise of the peg and any associated stabilisation mechanisms.
As a start, the regulator intends to focus its regulatory regime on single-currency pegged stablecoins (SCS) with value in circulation of more than S$5 million, and those issued in Singapore. Non-bank issuers that meet these criteria will have to obtain a major payment institution licence and be subject to new value stability, disclosure and insolvency safeguards.
Other stablecoins in the market, such as those pegged to a basket of currencies, commodities or algorithmic mechanisms will continue to be treated as DPTs, as they are seen to be “less stable”.
The proposed regulatory approach for stablecoin issuers covers these areas:
Value Stability
Issuers must hold reserve assets – in cash, cash equivalents or short-dated sovereign debt securities that are at least equivalent to 100 per cent of the par value of the outstanding SCS in circulation – to back the SCS issued.
These reserve assets will have to be denominated in the same currency as the pegged currency, and be held in separate accounts from the issuers’ own assets.
Issuers must also be audited by an external party, and ensure timely redemption at par value for holders of its SCS.
Reference Currency
All SCS issued in Singapore can be pegged only to the Singapore dollar or any Group of Ten currencies.
Disclosures
Issuers will be required to publish a white paper on their website disclosing details about the SCS, including the rights and obligations of the issuer and holders, as well as risks that can affect the stability of the SCS’ value. Such information should also be updated as needed.
Prudential Standards
Issuers must meet a base capital requirement that is either higher than S$1 million or 50 per cent of their annual operating expenses. They are also required to hold liquid assets which are valued at higher than 50 per cent of annual operating expenses or an amount assessed by the SCS issuer to be needed to achieve recovery or an orderly wind-down.
Meanwhile, banks in Singapore will be allowed to issue SCS, but they will not need to adhere to further reserve backing and prudential requirements if the SCS is issued as a tokenised form of bank liabilities. 
MAS deputy managing director for financial supervision Ho Hern Shin said the enhanced regulatory regime aims to support the development of value-adding payment use cases for stablecoins in Singapore.
Taken together, the two sets of proposed measures mark the “next milestone” in enhancing Singapore’s regulatory approach for an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem.
“As we continue to partner industry players to explore the potential benefits of tokenisation and distributed ledger technology, MAS will make appropriate adjustments to its regulatory regime to address the associated risks.” 
The consultation period for these proposals, during which the MAS invites comments from all interested parties, will end on Dec 21."
Jail for knife-wielding man who was shot by police in Clementi stand-off,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/knife-wielding-man-jail-shot-police-clementi-stand-soo-cheow-wee-3026011,"SINGAPORE: A knife-wielding man who was shot by the police after attacking random passers-by and charging at officers was sentenced to 33 months' jail on Wednesday (Oct 26).
Soo Cheow Wee, 50, pleaded guilty last month to four charges including voluntarily causing hurt by using a cutting instrument, criminal intimidation and causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty. 
Another four charges were considered in sentencing.
District Judge Luke Tan questioned the prosecutor on his submission for five years' corrective training for Soo. The prosecutor cited the corrective training report, which said Soo's propensity for violent reoffending is high.
Judge Tan said he was ""troubled"" by Soo's situation, which is ""a little bit"" unique. Soo has a condition that seems to be triggered by what he consumes, he said, pointing to a report from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
Defence lawyer Chooi Jing Yen said his client has been trying to reform himself and avoid drugs in recent years.
Citing the corrective training report, he said Soo has managed to remain drug-free since 2017.
""Whilst it's not appropriate for him to abuse cough syrup without prescription, to a certain extent he was doing that to cope with withdrawal from other heavier drugs,"" said Mr Chooi.
He said his client had wanted to be taken to the police station.
WHAT SOO DID
Soo had gone to Geylang on Feb 17 this year and drunk cough syrup and diazepam - a drug used to treat conditions such as anxiety and alcohol withdrawal - without prescriptions. He then took a knife and loitered along a pavement in Clementi, randomly swinging the knife at pedestrians on the instruction of a voice he heard.
Soo, who was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, injured a 41-year-old man on his evening stroll by slashing his arm.
He then flagged a taxi and asked to be driven to Clementi Police Division, but tried to alight while the cab was still moving.
He charged towards the taxi driver when the latter alighted to check on him, and the cabby drove off to Clementi Police Division to alert the police.
When police officers arrived, Soo shouted incoherently with the knife in his hand, and suddenly charged towards one of them.
Sensing an imminent threat to the life and safety of the police officers, the officer fired a round from his service revolver, striking Soo, who fell down.
He was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound that was not life-threatening and has been remanded since.
Soo also admitted to a previous incident in 2019 where he punched the face of an auxiliary police officer thrice. He did so after abusing cough syrup without a prescription. He was trying to return to a police station he was just released on bail from for drug consumption offences."

"Man gets jail for posing as female gynaecologist to get intimate photos, videos from 35 women",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ooi-chuen-wei-man-gets-jail-posing-female-gynaecologist-get-intimate-photos-35-women-dr-janice-lee-yan-hooi-3025916,"SINGAPORE: A man posed as a female gynaecologist and created fake profiles online to lure women into sending him photos and videos of their private parts.
Malaysian Ooi Chuen Wei, 37, duped 35 women into sending him more than 900 videos and images of their private parts.
He was sentenced to 40 months' jail on Wednesday (Oct 26). He pleaded guilty to six charges of cheating by personation, with another 15 charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Ooi's plan began in 2016. He made a Facebook profile with a fake name, planning to impersonate a doctor and gain the trust of victims.
To give an impression of legitimacy, he added both men and women as friends on Facebook. He also created an Instagram and LinkedIn account with similar profile details.
Between 2018 and 2021, he carried out the ruse with the following modus operandi: He would contact a victim on social media and introduce himself as Dr Janice Lee Yan Hooi, a purported gynaecologist from Gleneagles Medical Centre.
He would send the victim a template message in Mandarin, saying he was a gynaecologist and wanted to share a medical plan pertaining to the victim's breasts and vagina.
In his message, he explained how the victim would participate in the plan, which he claimed was approved by Gleneagles.
He would also ask the victim to fill out a self-monitoring survey, with questions pertaining to the breast and vagina as well as the victim's sex life.
Some victims took the bait and filled out the survey. In response, Ooi would fill out a Microsoft Excel sheet with the information and send it to the victim for viewing.
Ooi avoided speaking to the victims so as not to blow his cover. He also sent victims reports on what to take note of, in relation to breast and vaginal care.
He would also send another template for the victims to fill out, with samples of photos of breasts and vaginas for close monitoring.
He then instructed victims on how to conduct massages on their private parts, and asked for before and after pictures and videos, saying it was for the purpose of suggesting treatment.
919 PHOTOS AND VIDEOS SENT TO HIM
A total of 35 victims believed in Ooi's elaborate lies and sent photos of their breasts and vaginas to him, said the prosecutor.
There were a total of 919 photos and videos of the victims that constitute the offences.
One of the victims became suspicious and performed her own research. She realised there was no gynaecologist named Dr Janice at Gleneagles.
She lodged an electronic police report from Malaysia to the Singapore Police on Jul 24, 2021, saying she had fallen prey to a scam where a person impersonated a doctor to get her nude photographs.
The police raided Ooi's home and seized his devices. He admitted to all his offences during investigations, and described his modus operandi in detail. He said he knew the victims would be alarmed and humiliated if they knew he was not a woman.
There was no evidence that Ooi circulated the images or videos.
There were another seven victims that he attempted to cheat but was unsuccessful in doing so.
Deputy Public Prosecutor R Arvindren asked for at least 44 months' jail, saying there was a large number of victims and that the case spanned a long duration.
Ooi started planning in 2016 and committed the offences between 2018 and 2021, with dedication, said Mr Arvindren.
He exploited the trust that the victims had in doctors, in what was essentially a telemedicine ruse, he said.
The scheme was so believable that only one victim conducted background checks and only after she had already fallen for the scheme, said Mr Arvindren.
Ooi's lawyer Lee Terk Yang of Flint & Battery said his client had lost his job, his friends and his soon-to-be fiancee. 
""Basically he lost everything,"" said Mr Lee. 
He said Ooi was a foreigner living in a rented apartment in Singapore, with no family with him.
Ooi's life was in limbo in the past year and that has given him time to reflect, said the lawyer.
He asked the court to deal with Ooi with mercy, saying he was a changed man.
In sentencing, the judge noted the ""sheer number of victims"", the prolonged nature of Ooi's offending, as well as his persistence."

4 imported cases of BQ.1 and BQ1.1 COVID-19 subvariants in Singapore,"These Omicron subvariants were first detected in Nigeria and have since been found in more than 50 countries. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-bq1-bq11-omicron-covid-19-subvariants-detected-imported-moh-3025856,"SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed four cases of the BQ.1 and BQ1.1 Omicron subvariants as of Sunday (Oct 23), all of whom were imported infections, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.
None of the cases was hospitalised, the ministry added in response to CNA's queries on Wednesday.
BQ.1 and BQ1.1 are sub-lineages of the Omicron variant BA.5, and were first detected in July in Nigeria. The strains have since been detected in more than 50 countries.
“While both currently comprise a small proportion of COVID-19 cases globally, the number of BQ.1/BQ.1.1 cases has recently been rising in parts of Europe and North America,” MOH said.
“Observations from those countries suggest that BQ.1/BQ.1.1 are possibly more transmissible than previous BA.5 sub-lineages, but there is currently no evidence that they cause more severe illness.”

Two arrested for allegedly scamming iPhone 14 buyers on Carousell,"""Preliminary investigations revealed that the duo is believed to be involved in at least 140 similar cases with reported losses amounting to more than S$360,000,"" said the police.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iphone-14-carousell-e-commerce-scam-spf-3025096,"SINGAPORE: A 23-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested for their suspected involvement in a series of e-commerce scams, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Tuesday (Oct 25).
The scams involved the purported sale of iPhones on e-commerce platform Carousell.
Between Oct 1 and Oct 17, SPF received several reports from victims who were purportedly cheated by an online seller who had advertised the sale of mobile devices such as iPhone 14 series and iPhone 13 series models on Carousell.
The man had allegedly failed to deliver the items after payments were made by victims via PayNow or bank transfer.
Through follow-up investigations, officers from SPF's Commercial Affairs Department established the identity of the duo and arrested them at Changi Airport on Tuesday upon their arrival in Singapore.
""Preliminary investigations revealed that the duo is believed to be involved in at least 140 similar cases with reported losses amounting to more than S$360,000,"" said the police.
The two suspects will be charged in court on Wednesday with engaging in a criminal conspiracy to cheat, said the police.
The offence of cheating carries a prison term of up to 10 years and a fine.
The police advised members of the public to take precautions when making online purchases, such as only purchasing items from authorised sellers or reputable sources, especially for high-value items.
They added that the public should opt for buyer protection using in-built payment options that release payment upon delivery and, whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers as these methods do not offer any protection.
SPF cautioned that scammers may entice buyers to contact them directly through messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp or WeChat by offering better or faster deals if bank transfer payments are made directly to them.
These scammers may use local bank accounts or provide copies of identity cards to make victims believe that they are genuine sellers.
""Do not fall for it!"" SPF said.

Singapore police refute allegations that Malaysian fishermen were chased away by Police Coast Guard,"Malaysian fishing vessels were seen entering and exiting the live firing area of Singapore’s territorial waters off Lim Chu Kang, said the Singapore Police Force. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-police-coast-guard-refute-malaysia-fisherman-chased-territorial-waters-3024836,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Tuesday (Oct 25) refuted allegations that accused the Police Coast Guard (PCG) of chasing away Malaysian fishermen who had been in Malaysia territorial waters. 
The allegations, which were circulated online, are ""wholly untrue"", said SPF.
The police said their PCG officers were patrolling Singapore territorial waters on Sunday at about 4pm.
""They spotted a group of Malaysian fishing vessels entering and exiting the live firing area of Singapore’s territorial waters off Lim Chu Kang,"" said SPF, adding that unauthorised vessels are strictly prohibited from entering the live firing area for safety reasons. 
PCG officers approached the Malaysian fishing vessels and used their public address system on their boat to advise them to leave the live firing area in Singapore territorial waters.
At about 5.30pm on the same day, SPF said a few Malaysian fishing vessels approached the PCG officers and ""expressed unhappiness at being asked to leave the area"".
""Our officers explained that unauthorised vessels were prohibited from entering the area, and asked them to leave for their own safety.""
After a verbal exchange, the Malaysian fishing vessels returned to Malaysian territorial waters at about 5.40pm. This exchange also took place entirely in Singapore territorial waters, said SPF.
Malaysian media reported that the fishermen claimed that they had been chased away by Singaporean authorities while setting up shrimp nets in the Pasir Laba area near the Second Link Bridge on Sunday.
The fishermen have since lodged a police report, reported the Bernama news agency, with Iskandar Puteri district police chief Rahmat Ariffin saying that his department received it at 2.30pm. 
He also said that investigations are under way, and advised members of the public to refrain from speculation. 
Kota Iskandar assemblyman Pandak Ahmad was reported as saying that he regretted the actions of the Singaporean authorities, with the group of fishermen claiming they were chased away with harsh words.
According to Berita Harian, Mr Pandak said similar incidents have occurred a few times. However, fishermen have kept silent in order to avoid involvement."

Putin boosts Russia's war footing as battle looms for Ukraine's Kherson



















Ukrainian towns devastated by Russian bombardment seek international help to rebuild













Since Russia's forces suffered major battlefield defeats in September, President Vladimir Putin has escalated the war, calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists, announcing the annexation of occupied territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend Russian land.
This month, Russia started a new campaign using long-range cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones to attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure before winter sets in.
On Oct 19, Putin announced that he was introducing martial law in the four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claimed in September as its own territory but is struggling to defend from Ukrainian advances.
Putin also boosted the security powers of all Russia's regional governors, with the Kremlin ordering an ""economic mobilisation"" in eight regions adjoining Ukraine, including Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014.
It placed them in a special regime one step below martial law and allowed for the restriction of people's movements.
Putin said that the ""entire system of state administration"", not only the specialised security agencies, must be geared to supporting what Russia calls its ""special military operation""."
"Hiring of safe entry ambassadors due to staff turnover, not tighter COVID-19 restrictions: Recruitment firm","Job postings for safe entry ambassadors had prompted speculation that tighter COVID-19 restrictions could be reimposed.

JobStudio, which specialises in healthcare recruitment, told CNA on Tuesday (Oct 25) that it has been maintaining a pool of temperature screeners and safe entry ambassadors since last year. 
""Adjustments have also been made to the work description and it is not specifically for performing safe entry duties,"" said JobStudio's operation director Joseph Khor.
""As the position is a temporary position, turnover is expected.""

The job listing had prompted speculation about whether safe entry restrictions could be reimposed, months after Singapore removed the requirement for people to check in to venues using the TraceTogether app or token on Apr 26.
The country is currently experiencing a COVID-19 wave driven by the XBB Omicron subvariant and reinfections.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Oct 15 that while the Government does not rule out reimposing safe management measures such as mask-wearing, it would try its ""very best"" not to disrupt normal lives. 
In an update on Oct 23, he said the number of COVID-19 cases has peaked and is starting to come down. 
Experts have said that there is little need to implement ""blunt community restrictions"" at this point, with some noting that current infection appears less severe than previous ones.

CNA Explains: What you need to know about the XBB COVID-19 variant













In response to CNA's queries about the job posting, JobStudio's Mr Khor said the recruitment firm is ""puzzled"" by speculations about possible COVID-19 restrictions or a ""lockdown"".
""We would like to urge members of the public to adhere to announcements made only by (the) Ministry of Health,"" he added.
As the XBB wave has resulted in more people visiting healthcare institutions, Mr Khor said JobStudio supplies manpower to help in operations such as providing customer service and crowd control.
A search online showed that JobStudio has multiple openings for safe entry ambassadors, screeners or other similar positions. The listings describe duties such as providing basic frontline customer service, handling screening and ushering duties, performing data entry of health declarations and other ad-hoc duties.
According to Mr Khor, JobStudio deploys close to 50 workers in such positions.     
""We maintain a workforce of 50 for deployment and as turnover is expected, we post for the position from time to time to replenish the turnover,"" he added.
Recruitment firm People Profilers, whose advertisement for safe entry ambassadors was posted on job site Indeed, was surprised to find its listing still available. The role involved managing crowds and queues, as well as advising the public to wear their masks.
According to Indeed, the opening was more than 30 days old. 
People Profilers' chief consultant Debbie So said that the firm's last posting for such a role was at the beginning of the year, but that other sites might have auto-posted or trawled old listings. 
A man who saw the old listing for a safe entry ambassador had enquired about the position around two weeks ago, even though the role had been terminated months ago, said Ms So.

Make-up artist Xiao Kai, whose real name is Chang Ching-kai, posted a live video on the Instagram platform last week, sharing an encounter with Singapore's customs officers when he arrived at Changi Airport. 
In the video, which has since been deleted, he alleged in Mandarin that the officers told him he had to pay taxes for a Celine bag in his possession.
Xiao Kai said he was taken to a ""small room"" and asked to show a receipt for the luxury product, which he was unable to because he purchased it in Taipei in September.
He claimed the officers were mocking and did not believe he was a make-up artist.
""They made me feel like I was carrying drugs or smuggling gold or diamonds,"" he said.
Xiao Kai said the officers informed him that the bag was considered new as it was purchased in the last three months.
He ended up paying a tax of 7 per cent of its sale price, which he said was about NT$50,000 (S$2,205).
On Tuesday, the Singapore Customs told CNA it was aware of Xiao Kai's Instagram post on his ""unpleasant experience with the authorities at the airport over the payment of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for a bag he brought into Singapore"".
In response to queries, a spokesperson said that under Singapore's laws, arriving travellers, whether foreigners or returning residents, are required to declare and pay GST to bring in new goods exceeding their GST relief. 
“This is applicable whether the goods were purchased overseas or whether foreign taxes were paid,” the spokesperson added.
He added that this practice was consistent with other countries that also levy GST on goods such as souvenirs and gifts purchased overseas and meant for the traveller’s personal use.
For used personal items such as used clothing, shoes, bags and toiletries, travellers are not required to declare and pay GST on them, said the Customs spokesperson.
This is because such items are treated as used articles and personal belongings for which GST exemption is granted under the law.
“However, our officers at the checkpoint will assess the specifics of each case, such as the condition of the goods presented, to ascertain whether the goods are liable for GST payment,” the spokesperson added.
Singapore Customs said they have contacted Xiao Kai to understand the circumstances of his case.

University student filmed himself having sex with women he met on Tinder without their consent,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/university-student-filmed-himself-having-sex-women-he-met-tinder-without-their-consent-3024431,"SINGAPORE: A University undergraduate filmed himself having sex with women he met on Tinder, without obtaining their consent.
Joel Chan York Yee, 26, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Oct 25) to two charges of recording intimate videos without consent. Another two charges will be considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Chan met an 18-year-old woman on dating application Tinder in October 2020.
They began chatting on social media platforms including Instagram and Telegram, before agreeing to meet up for sex.
On Oct 23, 2020, the victim went to the university dormitory where Chan stayed and they had consensual sex there, the prosecutor said.
During the encounter, the victim realised that Chan's phone camera was facing them. She asked Chan if he was recording them having sex, and he said no.
The victim took the phone and placed it under a pillow before continuing.
Later that day, Chan asked her several times if he could record them having sex, but the victim declined. 
They went for dinner, and Chan asked the victim to be his girlfriend, but she rejected him. He replied that he would no longer contact her if she rejected him.
After that, the victim realised Chan had unmatched her from Tinder and that she no longer had access to his Instagram account.
Chan then met another woman, a 20-year-old student, on Tinder. Sometime before Nov 15, 2020, the student met Chan at his residence and they had consensual sex.
Without the woman's consent, Chan recorded a video of them having sex. On Nov 15, 2020, Chan went to the victim's place of residence and had consensual sex with her.
He recorded a video of the act without obtaining the victim's consent. The video captured the victim's private parts.
Court documents did not indicate how the case came to light.
On Tuesday, the judge called for a mandatory suitability report and adjourned sentencing to December."
"Jail for man who assaulted wife and ripped her nightgown, exposing her chest",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-man-who-assaulted-wife-and-ripped-her-nightgown-exposing-her-chest-3024376,"SINGAPORE: In the heat of a quarrel with his wife, a man attacked her with a guitar and motorcycle helmet and ripped her nightgown, exposing her chest to two male tenants.
The 54-year-old man was sentenced on Tuesday (Oct 25) to 10 months' jail. He pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, with another charge of using criminal force to outrage his wife's modesty taken into consideration.
He cannot be named due to gag orders protecting his wife's identity.
The court heard that the offender had an argument with his 42-year-old wife in their flat on the night of Feb 28, 2021.
In the argument, he threw his wife's phone to the ground and called her a prostitute, before grabbing her hair.
The flat was shared with two male tenants. The victim ran into the tenants' room to seek shelter, but was pursued by her husband, who continued assaulting her.
He punched and shook her, persisting in his assault despite the tenants asking him to stop.
The victim tried to escape by running around the house, but the accused chased her with a guitar and hit her with it. His wife took a motorcycle helmet to defend herself, but the offender took it from her and hit her with it.
The force of the attack broke the visor off the helmet.
The man then tore the front of his wife's nightgown, exposing her chest. He said: ""This woman is a prostitute,"" and said she was not fit to wear clothes.
He also called her a slut and a whore.
As a result, his wife felt humiliated and embarrassed. Seeing that the man was refusing to stop his attack, the tenants left to seek help from neighbours.
A police report was made and an ambulance called. The woman was taken to hospital with a laceration and a fractured finger that required surgery.
On Tuesday, the prosecutor asked for 10 to 12 months' jail, saying it was a sustained attack and a form of domestic violence. She pointed to the use of implements such as the guitar and helmet.
The judge read out parts of the victim impact statement, where the man's wife said her finger still hurts, such as in a cold environment. She said she felt embarrassed when her husband tore her clothes in front of the tenants, and still feels embarrassed.
As a result of the incident, she is now quieter and less talkative, something that her colleagues have noticed, the court heard.
Asked if he had anything to say in mitigation, the man initially said nothing. However, he later said his wife had made him angry. 
He said he was sleeping at home after returning from work when she started to make noise. He said she started to nag him and said he was tired from work.
He also pointed the finger at the tenants.
In response, the judge said: ""So you're blaming the tenants for not stopping you? Rather than blaming yourself for not stopping? I don't think you're helping yourself.""
He noted that the victim was the offender's wife, who could have expected protection from him but instead was assaulted by him.
There are ""so many aggravating factors in this case"", said the judge. However, he noted the man's clean record.
""I hope this is the first and last time something like this happens,"" he said."
Singapore grants interim authorisation for Pfizer bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine,"The second bivalent shot to be approved, it targets both the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pfizer-comirnaty-bivalent-covid-19-booster-vaccine-jab-shot-hsa-authorisation-3024286,"SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Tuesday (Oct 25) granted interim authorisation for Pfizer's Comirnaty bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine in Singapore.
This makes it the second such jab to be approved for use here after the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, which obtained interim authorisation in September and was rolled out earlier in October.
The Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) COVID-19 jab by Pfizer is an updated version of the original Comirnaty vaccine.
It comprises two components - 15 micrograms targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and 15 micrograms targeting the Omnicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, said HSA in a news release.
The Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is authorised for use as a booster shot for individuals aged 12 and above, who have received primary series COVID-19 vaccination.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung has said that bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines.
Last week, he announced that Singapore plans to invite people aged between 18 and 49 to take their COVID-19 bivalent vaccines later in the year, as more supplies are secured.
Earlier in October, the Government said it expects Pfizer's Comirnaty bivalent vaccine to be available in Singapore by the end of the year. 
It also announced then that children aged between five and 11 will be able to receive the Comirnaty vaccine as a booster dose.
BENEFITS EXPECTED TO OUTWEIGH RISKS: HSA
Official vaccination recommendations on the use of this booster will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in due time, added HSA. 
In making its regulatory decision, HSA said it consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts.
The authorisation was based on evidence including from Pfizer’s non-clinical studies, clinical trials with different variant-updated vaccines and manufacturing and quality processes.
With the clinical study by Pfizer for its Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) Vaccine still under way, the assessment of its efficacy was based primarily on an earlier clinical study conducted in individuals aged above 55 - but with the Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.1) Vaccine instead.
""HSA considers such data as relevant taking into account that these Omicron subvariants are closely related,"" said the authority.
The study showed that the bivalent vaccine elicited a stronger immune response against the targeted Omicron BA.1 variant, while preserving adequate response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, said HSA.
An ongoing clinical study with the bivalent (Original/Omicron BA. 4/5) vaccine also showed, in 80 participants aged 18 and above, consistent trends of higher immune responses against the Omnicron BA. 4/5 variant, and continued response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.
Safety data from the clinical studies showed that the bivalent vaccine was generally well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with what is known for the original vaccine, said HSA.
“The adverse events were mostly mild-to-moderate, such as injection site pain and/or tenderness, fatigue, headache and muscle pain,"" it added.
“These reactions are generally associated with vaccinations and expected as part of the body’s natural response to build immunity against COVID-19. They usually resolve on their own within a few days.""
HSA said that based on the available information, it has assessed that the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.
It said it will continue to actively monitor the safety of the vaccine and require Pfizer to submit data from the ongoing clinical study, to ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.
HSA added that it will take the necessary actions and provide updates to the public if significant safety concerns are identified.

WhatsApp back online after global outage hits users ,"WhatsApp's parent company Meta did not disclose the reason for the outage.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/whatsapp-outage-down-messaging-app-oct-25-3024361,"SINGAPORE: Popular messaging app WhatsApp has restored its services after users across the world reported issues earlier on Tuesday (Oct 25).
""We know people had trouble sending messages on WhatsApp today.
""We've fixed the issue and apologise for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson for WhatsApp parent company Meta Platforms said.
The company did not disclose the reason for the outage.
Users in Asia, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Europe were affected.
The website Downdetector saw a surge in reports just before 3pm Singapore time, with many users commenting that they were unable to send and receive messages.
At around 3.50pm, Downdetector showed that more than 68,000 users had reported problems with the app in the UK. Problems were also reported by 19,000 people in Singapore and 15,000 people in South Africa, it said.
As of 5pm, WhatApp appeared to be functioning normally, with reports tapering off on Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from sources such as user-submitted errors on its platform. 
WhatsApp has become a critical means of communication for households and businesses. When the app had an hours-long outage last October, it hit trading of assets from cryptocurrencies to oil, before traders switched to alternative platforms such as Telegram.
The app's latest outage comes during the festive season in India - its biggest market by user count - when people use the platform even more than usual to send season's greetings.
#whatsappdown was trending on Twitter, with more than 142,000 tweets and hundreds of memes flooding the Internet.
""Everyone who noticed #whatsapp is down have come to twitter to confirm it,"" said one Twitter user.

Singapore's fourth egg farm to begin operations in 2024,"The integrated egg production facility, backed by Japan's top egg producer, will also include a hatchery.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-fourth-egg-farm-begin-operations-2024-japan-producer-3024191,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's fourth egg farm will begin operations in 2024 as part of an integrated production facility.
Local operator ISE Foods Holdings (IFH) announced this on Tuesday (Oct 25) after receiving approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to build a commercial egg farm on about 10ha of land in Lim Chu Kang. 
The company is backed by Japan's top egg producer, ISE Japan, which also has operations in the United States, China, Vietnam and Thailand. 
Apart from the egg farm, the integrated egg production facility includes a day-old chick hatchery. 
When fully operational, it will be able to produce 360 million eggs and up to 5 million day-old chicks annually, said ISE Food Holdings. 
""This can increase the capacity of Singapore’s egg industry to collectively meet about half of Singapore’s demand for eggs, up from about 30 per cent today,"" it added.
Construction of the integrated facility will begin in phases from the first quarter of 2023.

SMART POULTRY FARMING
The farm will be the first in Singapore to have the full ecosystem of egg production, from the initial imports of day-old chicks that will eventually become the parents of other day-old chicks that lay eggs for consumption. 
Singapore’s current egg farms only import the day-old chicks that lay eggs for consumption.
State-of-the-art technology is being developed in collaboration with the National University of Singapore to create a live round-the-clock remote monitoring system, said ISE Food Holdings. 
""AI image recognition technology will be deployed to detect, in real-time the environment inside the farmhouse and any abnormal clinical symptoms in the hens without human intervention,""  it added.
""It will also allow many agricultural tasks to be automated, enabling the farm to prioritise its manpower deployment for higher value operations.""
In addition, the new facility will take steps to boost sustainability by increasing energy efficiency and adopting more environmentally friendly waste management. 
These include the use of renewable energy sources, water recycling systems, energy-efficient lighting fixtures with sensors and natural ventilation to reduce the need for air conditioning, said ISE Food Holdings.

"Singapore's core inflation rises further to 5.3% in September, edging towards 14-year high","The figure is expected to stay elevated before slowing in the second half of 2023, say MAS and MTI.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-core-inflation-september-2022-cpi-food-prices-3024016,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's core inflation rose further to 5.3 per cent in September, driven mainly by larger increases in the prices of food, services and retail and other goods, official data showed on Tuesday (Oct 25).
This is higher than the 5.1 per cent in August as the inflation figure inches towards a 14-year high.
The last time Singapore reported higher year-on-year core inflation growth was in November 2008, when it stood at 5.5 per cent.
Core inflation excludes accommodation and private transport costs. 
The headline consumer price index, or overall inflation, was 7.5 per cent year-on-year in September, unchanged from August.
""Core inflation is projected to stay elevated in the next few quarters before slowing more discernibly in (the second half of) 2023 as the current tightness in the domestic labour market eases and global inflation moderates,"" said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a joint media release.
Food inflation came in higher due to steeper increases in the prices of both food services and non-cooked food, hitting 6.9 per cent in September.
Accommodation inflation also picked up alongside a faster pace of increase in housing rents, hitting 4.9 per cent in September.
Services inflation rose to 4 per cent in September as the cost of point-to-point transport services and holiday expenses saw a larger increase. 
Private transport inflation fell to 22.3 per cent from 24.1 per cent in August due to a slower pace of increase in car and petrol prices. 
Prices of retail and other goods also registered a faster pace of increase, coming in at 3.1 per cent in September, as inflation for telecommunication equipment, medicines and health products and other personal care products edged up. 
Meanwhile, inflation for electricity and gas remained at 23.9 per cent, unchanged from August. 
For the full year, overall inflation is expected to average 6 per cent, while MAS core inflation is projected to come in at around 4 per cent.
In 2023, taking into account all factors including the Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase, headline and core inflation are projected to average 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent respectively, said the agencies.
Excluding the transitory effects of the GST hike, headline and core inflation are expected to come in at 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent respectively.
MAS and MTI also noted increasing risks to the inflation outlook, ""including from fresh shocks to global commodity prices and more persistent-than-expected external inflation"".

'More responsible' to proceed with GST increase amid uncertain inflation outlook: Lawrence Wong













LABOUR COSTS, WAGES TO RISE
Singapore's imported inflation is expected to remain significant for some time due to global conditions, said MAS and MTI.
In a note on the inflation outlook, they pointed out that global demand conditions in major economies and supply chain frictions have continued to ease; and that prices of energy and food commodities have come off their peaks from earlier in the year - but remain high given ongoing supply constraints.
""In addition, labour markets in major advanced economies are still tight, keeping wage pressures strong,"" said MAS and MTI.
""On the domestic front, unit labour costs will increase further in the near term alongside robust wage growth.""
The cost of utilities is also likely to remain elevated and firms are expected to continue to pass on accumulated import, labour and other business costs to consumer prices, the authorities added.
In June, the Government announced a S$1.5 billion support package to provide immediate relief from rising inflation to those who would be most affected. 
“The support measures in this package are tilted towards helping our lower-income and vulnerable groups because they are the ones who are disproportionately impacted by the effects of inflation,” said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong then.
Some key measures include a one-off GST Voucher cash special payment of up to S$300 for eligible Singaporeans, as well as a S$100 rebate on utilities for all Singaporean households.

MAS tightens monetary policy again: What it means for inflation, interest rates and the Sing dollar













MAS TO TIGHTHEN POLICY FURTHER: ECONOMISTS
Following the data release, private-sector economists said they are keeping their inflation forecasts for 2022 unchanged.
Maybank economists, for example, expect core inflation to come in at 4.2 per cent for the year, while headline inflation to be at 6.2 per cent.
“The wage-price spiral may intensify in the coming quarters, with the progressive wage model expanded to cover food services, waste management, and occupational sectors from Mar 1, 2023,” Dr Chua Hak Bin and Ms Lee Ju Ye wrote in a note.
“Accommodation costs will continue rising with the return of non-resident workers, delay in property completions and possibly higher demand from property sellers going through the 15-month HDB wait-out period,” they added.
RHB senior economist Barnabas Gan is pencilling in 3.8 per cent and 5.8 per cent for core and headline inflation, respectively.
With inflation indicators remaining elevated, economists expect the MAS to further tighten monetary policy at its next policy meeting scheduled for April 2023.
The central bank has thus far tightened monetary policy five times since last October, including two off-cycle moves, to help rein in inflation. 
Unlike most central banks that manage monetary policy through the interest rate, it uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool because Singapore is an open economy that depends heavily on trade. This refers to the S$NEER – the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar managed against a trade-weighted undisclosed basket of currencies from Singapore’s major trading partners.
It lets the exchange rate float within an unspecified policy band and changes the slope, width and centre of that band when it wants to adjust the pace of appreciation or depreciation of the Singapore dollar.
Its latest move on Oct 14 entailed a re-centring of the mid-point of the policy band “up to its prevailing level”.
Reasons for the MAS to retain its hawkish tone include how core inflation – a key gauge for the central bank – is set to persist above “the symbolic 2 per cent handle” from now until the first half of next year. This suggests that tighter monetary policy is needed to cushion price pressures, said Mr Gan.
Upside risks to Singapore’s inflation outlook, including unexpected shocks to global commodity prices and more persistent external inflation, remain. In addition, the S$NEER has seen a significant strengthening since the central bank’s latest tightening move.
Noting that the S$NEER has risen to 1 per cent above the midpoint in just over a week, “more appreciation headroom may be needed for a stronger Singapore dollar in response to the current inflation environment"", Mr Gan wrote.
“We think that the MAS will further tighten its monetary policy in April 2023, possibly via a slight steepening of the S$NEER gradient by 0.5 per cent, while leaving the width and the level at which the S$NEER is centred unchanged.”
Maybank economists expect the central bank to go for another re-centring. 
“Our model suggests that the S$NEER is currently trading at about 1.1 per cent above the mid-point of the new re-centred band, with room left for further appreciation,” they said."

"Woman gets jail for repeatedly punching maid, leaving her blind and with a deformed ear","Ummi Kalsum Ali repeatedly assaulted the 51-year-old maid until she became blind. The victim was left in a wheelchair at the airport to find her own way home.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-repeatedly-punched-maid-until-she-was-blind-both-eyes-gets-jail-ummi-kalsum-ali-3023966,"SINGAPORE: After blinding her domestic helper in one eye by punching her repeatedly, a woman refused to let her receive medical treatment. She kept assaulting the maid until the victim eventually lost her sight in the other eye as well.
Despite losing vision in both eyes, the maid continued to perform her chores while slowly feeling her way around the house. When she accidentally burnt her employer's clothes as she could not see, her employer pressed a hot iron on her.
The 51-year-old maid's ear also became deformed as a result of the abuse, and was left at the airport in a wheelchair to find her own way home.
On Tuesday (Oct 25), Ummi Kalsum Ali, 43, was sentenced to 10 years' jail and a fine of S$4,500. She pleaded guilty to six charges. These include voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a maid, ill-treating a maid by neglecting to give her medical attention and failing to pay her salary on time. Ten other charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that the victim, a 51-year-old Indonesian national, began working for Ummi on Aug 5, 2019. She was to be paid S$670 as her monthly salary.
Over about five months from April 2020, Ummi began abusing the maid. The Singaporean had earlier confiscated her handphone and installed closed-circuit television cameras in the kitchen to monitor the victim.
In April 2020, Ummi was displeased with the victim, the court heard. She began slapping the victim on her face and ears repeatedly and punched her ears.
She also punched the victim's eyes and when the victim tried to shield her eyes from the repeated blows, Ummi pulled down one of her hands before continuing her punches.
The victim went blind in her right eye after one of the punches and fell to the ground. But Ummi tried to pull her up by her ponytail before continuing to hit her eyes.
Ummi also hit the victim with a handphone and struck her eye with a hanger. The hanger broke from the force of the assault, and Ummi eventually stopped her attack.
As a result, the victim's left ear swelled and hardened and became deformed. Ummi saw that it was swollen but did not take her to a doctor.
A few days after this, the victim told Ummi that she could not see in one eye and asked to visit a doctor, but Ummi denied her request. She threatened the maid, saying she could no longer return if she left the house.
The victim asked if Ummi could accompany her to a doctor, but Ummi refused.
THE ASSAULT CONTINUED
Between April 2020 and September 2020, Ummi continued to abuse the victim. Even though she knew the victim had become blind in one eye, she did not stop assaulting the maid, until she became completely blind.
The victim had to touch the floor and walls of the house to feel her way around as she continued with the household chores.
In one incident, she accidentally burnt Ummi's clothes as she could not see. Angered, Ummi pressed the hot iron on the victim, but the maid did not retaliate or scream.
Footage from closed-circuit television cameras installed to monitor the maid was played in court. The victim was depicted staggering around slowly, bent over and reaching out to feel her way around.
In several clips played in court, the accused was shown sitting while her husband cooked and the victim squatted on the floor, cleaning. The accused's husband was also shown shouting loudly at the victim when she accidentally touched him. He is not facing any charges, the court heard.
Between January 2020 and September 2020, Ummi did not pay the maid her salary on time. 
On Oct 23, 2020, Ummi left the victim in a wheelchair at the airport with airport personnel. She gave the victim about S$6,750 in Singapore dollars and Indonesian rupiah. The victim was left there to find her own way home.
The abuse was discovered when she returned to her hometown, and she was flown back to Singapore to assist with investigations. 
In her pre-employment medical check-up in July 2019, the victim weighed 76kg. In February 2021, she weighed only 52.8kg.
She was given medical attention in Singapore, but her blindness is irreversible, the court heard.
The case was handled by a deputy public prosecutor and a Ministry of Manpower prosecutor. The deputy public prosecutor asked for a total of 10 years' jail, while the MOM prosecutor called the case ""cruel"".
Ummi's lawyer, Mr Sui Yi Siong from Harry Elias Partnership, said there were other videos that showed the victim may not have been completely blind.
The judge told him that the victim was ""irreversibly blind"" as his client had admitted, and asked if his client was saying that the victim was ""acting"".
Mr Sui said the victim was not acting per se, but that there was a later video showing the victim avoiding his client. He argued that she may not have been completely blind.
The court heard that the accused had paid the victim an undisclosed amount as part of a confidential settlement.
VICIOUS PUNISHMENTS BORDERING ON TORTURE: JUDGE
In sentencing, Senior District Judge Bala Reddy called the working relationship between the accused and the victim ""generally oppressive and exploitative"".
He said he found it most aggravating that the victim was put through ""humiliating and degrading punishments"" that resulted in, among other things, her becoming irreversibly blind.
The ""vicious punishments"" that Ummi meted out on the victim bordered on torture, he said.
""To make matters worse, the accused doesn't seem to show much remorse for her actions,"" said the judge.
He pointed to how Ummi instructed her counsel that the victim may not be all that blind as she could move around the house, contrary to medical records and video footage.
He granted Ummi's request to defer sentence to Nov 8 to settle her affairs, including childcare arrangements."
Stricter criteria to be set for electricity retailers to guard against market volatility,"Several electricity retailers exited the market within weeks last year, citing unfavourable market conditions. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/energy-market-stricter-criteria-electricity-retailers-volatility-gas-supply-3019531,"SINGAPORE: The Energy Market Authority (EMA) will enhance regulatory requirements on electricity retailers to protect consumers amid market volatility, after several players called it quits late last year. 
Potential retailers can only enter the market if they have sufficient financial strength and sustainable business plans to withstand some degree of market volatility, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a press release on Tuesday (Oct 25).
""We also plan to impose higher capital/hedging requirements on retailers to ensure that they are sufficiently resilient against market volatility, and additional protections for consumers if retailers prematurely terminate contracts,"" the ministry added.
These are among the measures authorities will implement to ensure Singapore's energy security.
In his keynote address at the annual Singapore International Energy Week on Tuesday, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said electricity prices rose multiple folds this year due to a “perfect storm” of fossil fuel shortages exacerbated by the Ukraine war, severe disruptions in renewable power as well as global oil and spot gas price spikes.
With Singapore importing almost all of its energy supply, its electricity market was “severely” tested as fuel prices surged, he said.
In the second half of last year, at least five electricity retailers exited the market within weeks, citing soaring wholesale electricity prices and unfavourable market conditions. 
It came amid a global energy crunch, prompting EMA to take ""extraordinary"" steps last October to safeguard energy supplies, which include setting up standby fuel facilities for power generation companies (gencos) to draw upon to generate electricity if needed.
Authorities had also directed gencos to procure sufficient fuel to generate electricity based on their available generation capacity. These measures will be in place until the end of March 2023.
While the emergency measures helped to stabilise the market, Mr Gan stressed the need to strengthen Singapore’s energy market structure.
“This is unlikely to be the last energy crunch we will face. The global clean energy transition will also not be a plain-sailing one, and we can expect continued volatility going forward,” he said.
He added that EMA will also look into tightening the eligibility criteria for wholesale electricity price plans, so that only consumers who are able to deal with the risks of price volatilities would be allowed to buy these plans.
""All consumers can still enter into retail contracts, while consumers who qualify for the regulated tariffs can still continue to do so,"" he said.

ENSURING SECURITY OF GAS SUPPLIES
Singapore has a liberalised power sector where private generation companies procure fuel, generate electricity and sell to consumers, MTI said, noting that this competitive market structure has its limitations.
Although EMA sets the performance standards, it does not intervene in gas contracting, generation capacity planting and electricity pricing. 
""While this competitive market structure has served us well over the past two decades – increased innovation and efficiencies in operations, and a wider range of retail options for consumers – some gaps have emerged,"" MTI said. 
For instance, when gas prices are high, gencos are less inclined to contract for gas for fear that they would be left stranded when gas prices moderate. 
""Without the assurance of back-to-back electricity contracts, gencos are also reluctant to enter into longer-term gas contracts which typically offer greater guarantee of delivery and lower prices,"" MTI noted. 
To address this, EMA will institutionalise the measure requiring gencos to maintain sufficient fuel for power generation.
It will also work with the industry to explore ways to improve gas procurement, such as by collectively contracting for longer-term gas contracts for greater security of supply, or demand aggregation to provide economies of scale. EMA will also maintain the standby LNG facility to manage gas supply disruptions.
ENSURING SUFFICIENT POWER-GENERATING CAPACITY
To ensure sufficient generation capacity to meet system demand, a structured process will be introduced to facilitate private investments.
Currently, investments in new generation capacity are driven by each company’s commercial considerations. 
Since it takes about four to five years to plant a new generation unit, there could be prolonged periods of over- and under-supply, leading to volatile electricity prices, said MTI.
To address this, EMA will conduct a competitive tender about five years in advance of the year in which the generation capacity is projected to be required. The most competitive proposal will be awarded a licence to build, own and operate the new capacity.
All new generation plantings will be coordinated to avoid risks of over- and under-capacity. 
EMA will step in as a last resort if there is insufficient private sector interest to build new generation capacity. 
""While these guardrails will, to some extent, reduce choice for market participants (gencos and retailers) and consumers, it will help to improve the stability and security of our power sector in the longer term and ensure that Singapore is well placed to navigate the energy transition,"" MTI said. 
""We are mindful that these adjustments will reduce the flexibility of some market participants,"" said Mr Gan.
""Generation companies cannot plant new capacity as they wish. Consumers may have fewer retailers to choose from. Some may not be allowed to purchase electricity from the wholesale electricity market.""
""However, these measures will bring about a stronger and more secure power system collectively,"" he said, adding that the Government will consult the industry and the public on the proposed changes.
This will be conducted by EMA over the next few months, with the measures to be rolled out progressively in 2023.

Buying discounted sunscreen online? You might be getting a fake,"Counterfeit sunscreen products sold online may lack a sunscreen filter, raising the risk of UV damage and skin cancer, doctors say.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sunscreen-real-fake-biore-online-retailer-shopee-3016586,"SINGAPORE: Lured by discounts offered on an e-commerce platform, Mr Yen Feng decided to stock up on his favourite sunscreen online. 
But after he received his order of the Biore UV Aqua Rich Essence, he found that the sunscreen's texture and colour were different from the same product he bought previously at official retailers. 
While the yoga teacher initially wrote off the changes to different production batches, a video he came across comparing the different versions of the same product heightened his suspicions. 
""Everything the woman said in the video was true for me. From the packaging to the font,"" Mr Feng, 42, told CNA. 
Mr Feng, who also took to his Facebook page to share his findings, said: ""A search on Google and several videos later, I went out to buy another tube from Guardian at full retail at S$18.90 to compare the two tubes.
""Suffice to say I am pretty convinced I’ve been applying fake sunscreen over the past six months.""
A CNA check of the product listing on the Shopee e-commerce platform where Mr Feng bought his sunscreen from found that the majority of customers' reviews were positive. Only a handful of customers complained that the sunscreen was different from the ones they bought at retail shops. 
As of Friday (Oct 21), the listing was no longer available. In a statement to CNA, Shopee said: ""In line with our standard protocols we removed this listing from our platform as soon as it was flagged to us, and we are conducting a review of this listing with the seller.""
The seller, who has a ""preferred"" label, remains on the platform with other skincare products listed for sale. 






      A screenshot of the Shopee listing that has been taken down.
    






Mr Feng is not alone in his experience. Customers who have turned to e-commerce platforms hoping to snag a good deal for skincare products have also encountered what they believe to be fakes. 
A housewife who wanted to be known as Ms Teo said she purchased skincare products under The Ordinary brand from an online platform. They were 30 per cent cheaper than the originals that her husband bought from the US. 
She had been convinced by the online listing, which she said was “full of original images, convincing images, write-ups in the descriptions, good ratings”. 
 
“Everything seemed legit,” she said. But the colour, consistency and smell of the products turned out different from the originals.
“I only used once and felt they were very 'off'. Luckily, I didn’t experience adverse reactions. But I also felt they did nothing for my skin,” the 30-year-old said. 
Another user who went by the name Mary Ang took to Facebook last month to complain about counterfeit Kiehl's products that she bought online. She told CNA that she had ordered three Kiehl’s items from a local seller on Shopee. 
Initially, Ms Ang said she was suspicious as the price was about 30 per cent cheaper than Kiehl’s official store, but decided to trust the platform and the seller, who had a high rating. 
“On Aug 25, 2022, I received my order from Shopee and I found it is a fake product right after first use as I have been using Kiehl’s for very long time,” she said. 
In reply to queries from CNA, Kiehl’s said it advises customers to buy directly from official stores and that it ""cannot guarantee the authenticity and efficacy"" of products bought from other online sites or unauthorised retailers. 
SELLERS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS: SHOPEE, HSA
CNA asked Shopee and rival e-commerce platform Lazada for the number of fraud complaints they have received and safeguards to prevent counterfeit products from being sold. Lazada declined to comment, while Shopee said the sale of such items was ""strictly prohibited"". 
In a statement, Shopee said it requires sellers to comply with local regulations and its policies on prohibited items. 
Shopee did not provide the number of fraud complaints it has received about skincare or sunscreen products being sold on its platform. But it said: ""We take pre-emptive measures to intercept offending products from being listed on the platform, and we cooperate with local governments and health authorities to take down listings of products that are flagged.
""Listings found to have regulatory violations or other violations of our terms of use will be removed.""
Shopee added it has processes in place to encourage sellers to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction. Likewise, a seller penalty point system discourages them from violating policies.
""We would also like to encourage users to reach out to Shopee if they encounter similar listings on our platform,” it added. Users can report products they suspect to be counterfeit directly from any product listing's page. 
The platform also offers the Shopee Mall and preferred sellers programmes.
The Shopee Mall label is reserved for brand owners and authorised distributors, where products are guaranteed to be authentic. A seller has to submit relevant documents, such as an authorisation letter from the brand. Lazada's equivalent is the LazMall programme. 
The preferred sellers programme, on the other hand, is for sellers who are deemed to have provided an ""enhanced shopping experience"", according to the Shopee website.  This is based on ratings, customer service quality and track record in shipping orders quickly and efficiently. Lazada has a similar programme. 
In response to CNA's queries, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which regulates sunscreen as cosmetic products, said it has not received complaints or feedback about this in the past two years. 
The agency said it will work with product owners to investigate any complaints and take action if there are safety concerns. 
""When deemed necessary, HSA may direct sellers or suppliers to remove the cosmetic product from the market and members of the public will also be alerted on harmful products,"" a spokesperson said.

COMPLAINTS OF SUNBURNS AFTER USING COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Kao Singapore, which manages the Biore brand here, told CNA that counterfeit Biore UV Aqua Rich Essence products cost the company an estimated S$85,000 in lost sales in Singapore this year alone. 
""We have received consumer enquiries to confirm if the products they purchased are original or counterfeit and confirmed that they are counterfeit,"" said Biore brand manager Ray Lim.
""Some of these consumers have (given) feedback that they experienced sunburn after using the counterfeit products.”
Mr Lim said that some customers buy fake products thinking they are parallel imports. 
""Kao Singapore is monitoring counterfeit products in the market, and taking appropriate actions in cooperation with headquarters in Japan when it detects and receives enquiries,"" he said.
The company is also considering legal action against these copyright infringements, he added. 
Asked if it was possible to identify fakes by their batch number, Mr Lim said that both real and counterfeit products had such codes on the tube's edge. 
The best way to avoid counterfeits, according to Mr Lim, was to buy from authorised distributors and official stores, rather than resellers. 
However, even this requires some vigilance on the consumer’s part. Some resellers use the same images as official stores, so customers need to check the store's name instead of relying on photos, Mr Lim said.
Neoasia, an authorised distributor of Heliocare in Singapore, said users can identify if the products they have purchased are authentic.
Heliocare products come with a unique QR code that users can scan to verify their authenticity. The brand specialises in sunscreen products.  
A Neoasia spokesperson said that consumers should purchase from authorised sources as there were other factors to consider even if the product appeared identical, such as how the product was stored or handled.

DOCTORS WEIGH IN
Those who apply fake sunscreen are not only at risk of having unapproved ingredients on their skin, counterfeit sunscreen may well lack the sun protection that genuine products provide. 
Doctors whom CNA spoke to said there were no sure ways to tell the authenticity of the product even after it is applied. 
Over the past two years, aesthetic doctor Rachel Ho has seen three female patients who used fake sunscreen. Two of them had unwittingly purchased counterfeits from online third-party retailers. 
Some patients realised the products were counterfeit after noticing that the sunscreen or its packaging had a different colour, consistency or smell, Dr Ho said. Others found they had sunburns or their hyperpigmentation worsened despite using the products.
""Counterfeit, imitations of sunscreens by recognised brands are becoming more accessible,"" said Dr Ho, who is the medical director of La Clinic. “For consumers shopping online, it can be difficult for them to verify the authenticity of these products, and they may be lured by the comparatively lower prices of these counterfeit products.""
Dr Ho, who runs an educational blog on the science behind skincare and related trends, said that counterfeit products may lack a sunscreen filter, raising the risk of UV damage and skin cancer.
Fake products may also contain harmful ingredients such as mercury.  
""Counterfeit skincare is unlikely to have undergone safety tests, and the true ingredients may be obscured in the ingredient list that’s printed on the product packaging,"" added Dr Ho. 
Dr Angeline Yong, medical director at Angeline Yong Dermatology, said that users of fake sunscreen may be lulled into a ""false sense of protection"" while not receiving adequate protection. 
Differentiating real and fake sunscreen by outcome alone can be challenging, noted Dr Yong, who is also a consultant dermatologist. While users of fake sunscreen may get sunburns, the same could happen to those who use authentic sunscreen incorrectly or inadequately. 
Users who fail to reapply sunscreen every two to three hours while in the sun, use sunscreen that washes off during watersports or apply an insufficient layer of sunscreen could similarly suffer the sun's ill effects.
Another dermatologist advised users to look at a sunscreen's ingredients, sun protection factor, UVA protection rating – known as PA on most packaging – as well as manufacturing and expiry dates.
The information section should have clear instructions for usage and no grammatical mistakes, said Dr Lynn Chiam of the Children & Adult Skin Hair Laser Clinic. 
All three doctors pointed to buying from reputable sources as the best way to avoid fakes. 
And that is what Mr Feng intends to do. He plans to skip the online deals and only buy from official retailers from now on. 
""I will wait for Guardian and Watsons to have sale,"" he said.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) was alerted to a fire in a second floor unit of Block 108 Bedok North Road at about 11.35am.
When firefighters arrived, the fire was raging inside the unit, and involved the contents of a bedroom. The blaze was extinguished by the firefighters and no occupants were found inside the flat.
A person who evacuated from the affected unit before SCDF's arrival was assessed for smoke inhalation and taken to Singapore General Hospital. 
Another person from a neighbouring unit was also assessed for smoke inhalation but did not want to be taken to hospital, SCDF said in a Facebook post.

The police evacuated about 50 residents from the third to sixth floors of the block as a precautionary measure.
A preliminary investigation indicated that the fire had likely originated from the battery pack of a power-assisted bicycle (PAB) in the affected bedroom, said SCDF.
It warned against charging PAB batteries for extended periods of time or overnight, adding that people should not buy or use non-original batteries."
"Jetstar Asia, Changi Airport yet to finalise agreement; airline to continue operating from T1",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jetstar-asia-changi-airport-yet-finalise-agreement-terminal-1-3021671,"SINGAPORE: Changi Airport Group (CAG) and Jetstar Asia concluded a joint study on the airline's operations at the airport, but an agreement has yet to be finalised.
For now, the airline will continue to operate from Terminal 1 of Changi Airport, CAG and Jetstar Asia said in identical statements on Sunday (Oct 23).
An announcement will be made soon, they said.
The study was part of CAG's engagement with the airline over its slated move to Terminal 4.
On Jul 22, CAG announced that Terminal 4 would reopen on Sep 13, with 16 airlines relocating there, including Jetstar Group.
The Jetstar Group released a statement on the same day to say that it had no intention of moving its operations to Terminal 4.

""We are extremely disappointed that the Changi Airport Group has chosen to unilaterally announce a plan to relocate the Jetstar Group to Terminal 4 at Changi International Airport, before any agreement has been reached,"" it said at the time.
""A joint study was only agreed to be undertaken last week and this announcement completely disregards that agreement and the impact a move would have on our customers, our people, and our operations.""
Jetstar Group added then that until an agreement is reached, it had no intention of moving.
The Jetstar Group mainly operates out of Terminal 1 at Changi Airport, with limited arrivals at Terminal 2. 
On Aug 30, Transport Minister S Iswaran said that CAG and the Jetstar Group were in discussions to ensure that Jetstar's operations remain effective and that the needs of its passengers are met.
""It is important to do this well rather than do it fast,"" Mr Iswaran said at the time.
""If it means taking a little bit more time, but making sure that all the key elements are taken care of well, to the reasonable satisfaction of all the parties involved, then I think that should be our priority. And I think that's the basis on which both parties are working together.""

Number of COVID-19 cases in current wave has peaked and is starting to come down: Ong Ye Kung,"About 20 per cent of cases daily are reinfections, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-wave-xbb-peak-cases-starting-come-down-ong-ye-kung-3021561,"SINGAPORE: Based on the last week, the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore has peaked and is starting to come down, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Sunday (Oct 23).
Singapore is in the middle of a COVID-19 wave driven by the XBB variant and reinfected cases. Currently, about one in five daily cases are reinfections.
“We have to continue to watch to see whether (the number of cases) bounces again, because it can happen,” Mr Ong told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of a sports hall in Bukit Canberra.
“But if it continues to come down from here, that means our modelling actually was a bit more pessimistic. We thought it would peak by the first half of November.”
If the downtrend sustains, that would mean that the wave peaked earlier than expected, the minister said, adding that people should still get vaccinated.
He said the recommendation is for seniors to take the new bivalent vaccine from Moderna because it is an “updated version” that is more effective against the current variant.
About 20,000 people aged 50 and above have taken the new vaccine.
Earlier this week, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the bivalent vaccine would be offered to healthcare workers in the public and private sectors from Oct 25.
Children aged six months to four years can receive their primary vaccination with the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine from Oct 25.

Singapore hospitals seeing high number of patients who do not need emergency care: Healthcare groups



















Longer waiting times at hospitals with some patients told to wait up to 50 hours for a bed













HOSPITAL WAITING TIMES
Mr Ong also addressed a question about the long wait times for consultation and beds in hospitals.
Hospitals are seeing a high number of patients whose conditions do not require emergency care, the group chairmen of the medical boards of SingHealth, the National Healthcare Group and the National University Health System said on Friday night.
Mr Ong said on Sunday: “This is something that's been happening since the beginning of the year. It's not something new.”
While the hospitals are not seeing a lot more COVID-19 patients, more wards are taken up by such patients during a wave.
“So imagine before this wave, we have about 200 beds occupied. Now it is 600 plus, so 400 beds got taken out because of COVID-19 patients,” Mr Ong explained.
This means it is harder for emergency departments to refer patients to wards, making emergency departments more congested. He added that measures are being taken to help the situation.
Life continues to be “very hectic” in hospitals, said Mr Ong.
“Even while we carry on with our life and are happy that the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, remember we need to give healthcare workers our full support,” he added.
“These healthcare workers are old and young, men and women, of all seniorities, local and foreign – and foreign they're from many countries – they all deserve our support.
“We want them to stay as an integrated team – lift up their morale as much as possible, continue to show the love, care and support as we did at the height of the pandemic.”
As of noon on Sunday, 4,454 new cases were recorded. The week-on-week infection ratio was 0.88 – a number below 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is falling.

Woman sues town council after falling into drain: What can you do if this happens to you?,"What should you do if you fall into a drain and want to seek compensation? CNA speaks to lawyers about possible courses of action. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-sues-town-council-after-falling-drain-lawsuit-claim-compensation-negligence-holland-bukit-timah-3011246,"SINGAPORE: Last month, a 71-year-old woman sued Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council for more than S$33,000 in damages after falling into an uncovered drain and sustaining injuries.
The trial concluded on Sep 19, with a verdict pending. 
What can you do if you're in a similar situation and want to seek compensation? CNA speaks to lawyers about the possible courses of action. 
FIRST STEP: SEE A DOCTOR
The first thing to do is to seek medical care, said Mr Muhammad Razeen Sayed Majunoon, associate at Advance Law.
""Turning to the courts is not the best option to start with. You may ask your lawyer, or by yourself, try writing to the relevant authorities or organisations to ask for compensation,"" he said.
Public liability insurance would usually cover such situations, said Mr Razeen.
The claimant should obtain a medical report detailing the extent of injuries suffered, prognosis and if any follow-up treatment is required, said Mr Tang Shangwei, partner in specialist and private client disputes and white collar and enforcement practices at WongPartnership.
One of the ways to seek compensation would be to seek damages by bringing a claim under the tort of negligence, said Ms Alyssa Mundo, associate director at Tembusu Law.
KEEP RECORDS
To do that, first ensure you have the correct documentation and evidence. Make a record of the scene of the incident by photographing it comparatively to show the size of the gap or areas which are uncovered, said Mr Tang.
The person should keep the receipts of payments made for medical treatments, transport to and from medical treatments and devices bought as a result of the injury such as walking sticks and crutches, said Ms Choo Yean Lin, partner at Tan Lee & Partners.
This can also include the documentation if you needed to engage a helper because of the incident.
""In other words, gather as much information as possible to boost your case,"" said Ms Choo.
Other evidence to gather include those pertaining to losses that occurred due to the injury, such as a broken phone and loss of earnings, said Mr Razeen.
IDENTIFY THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE
The next step would be to identify which entity or entities are responsible for the management, maintenance and upkeep of the property where the drain is located, said Mr Tang.
This may include the managing agents, engaged cleaning contractor or other contractors responsible for the space.

'Lover's spat': Woman who sued psychiatrist for prescribing Xanax pills loses suit













Generally, national water agency PUB is responsible for the drains in Singapore, said Mr Razeen. 
The agency needs to check the drains regularly and perform maintenance where necessary.
""In some instances, home owners or businesses might be responsible for the drains within their properties. If you are injured falling into a drain, it is essential that you record where the incident happened to help identify who your claim will be made against,"" said Mr Razeen.
If the claimant is not sure who has management or control over the relevant drain, the claimant may consider making an application in court to compel a party to disclose information or documents, said Mr Suang Wijaya, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP. 
This would be for the purpose determining who is the proper party to sue, he said.
ESTABLISH CONTACT
The claimant may first consider engaging in legal correspondence with the entity in charge of the drain, said Mr Wijaya.
""Such correspondence would be to explore whether parties may amicably settle the dispute without court litigation,"" he said. ""If there is no amicable settlement, the claimant may have to consider the prospects of commencing litigation against the other party.""
The claimant will have to prove that they were owed a duty of care by the defendant, said Mr Razeen.
""For example, if you fell into a drain at your workplace (business premises), your employer might have been negligent,"" he said, pointing to the Work Injury Compensation Act.
SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN COURT
Before heading to court, a person can try other avenues first. These include mediation, a recognised form of alternative dispute resolution in Singapore, said Mr Tang.
""With the assistance of an independent mediator, the parties in dispute can work towards reaching an amicable resolution to the matter,"" he said. 
""If a settlement is reached, the matter ends there. However, if a resolution cannot be obtained, the claimant can still proceed with the court process.""
A claimant can also seek an insurance payout from his or her own insurance, but this does not preclude him or her from seeking compensation from the party responsible for the injuries, said Mr Tang.
A personal accident plan may provide coverage for such incidences, said Ms Mundo. She added that a town council may also have its own insurance policies to cover situations where such accidents take place within premises under the town council’s control and responsibility.
WHICH COURT TO HEAD TO?
It is the claimant who chooses which court to commence proceedings in, and the proper court in turn depends on the amount of damages they are claiming for, said Mr Wijaya.
The Magistrate's Court can award damages of up to S$60,000, while the District Court can award damages of up to S$250,000, lawyers told CNA. In the case of road traffic accident claims or claims for personal injuries arising from industrial accidents, a District Court can award sums of up to S$500,000, said Mr Razeen.
Damages of above S$250,000 can be awarded by the High Court, the lawyers said.
The amount of damages claimed would depend on the extent of injuries or financial losses sustained by the claimant, said Mr Wijaya.
The compensation amount can be calculated based on two types of damages, said Mr Razeen: General damages for things like pain, suffering and loss of amenities, and special damages like medical costs, travel expenses and loss of income.

For workplace injury claims under the Work Injury Compensation Act, the time limit to make the claim is within a year from the incident, said Mr Razeen.
The time limit for other personal injury claims is within three years from the incident, he added.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS?
Asked to comment on the chances of success, lawyers CNA spoke to said each case is different and it depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
The defendant can argue that the claim should fail or be significantly reduced for multiple reasons, said Mr Wijaya.
These include: That the defendant does not owe the claimant a duty of care, that the defendant has complied with the standard of care, that the claimant's injury was not caused by the defendant's actions, that the claimant was himself careless and contributed to his own injury, or that the compensation asked for is excessive.
The court will assess whether a duty of care was owed to the claimant, whether there was a breach of this duty of care and if so, whether it resulted in the claimant's injuries, said Mr Tang.
In determining the appropriate standard of care the defendant is held to, several factors will be considered including: The likelihood and risks of harm caused by the hazard, the extent of harm, the costs of avoiding the harm and the industry standards and common practice, he added.
Even if the claimant succeeds, the court will have to determine if there was any contributory negligence on the claimant's part that resulted in the injuries, said Mr Tang.
Explaining further, Mr Razeen said the amount of damages may be reduced if the claimant is found to be contributorily negligent. 
""For example, if you fell into the drain because you were practising your parkour moves and thus ended up in an accident, the court may reduce the amount of damages (i.e. monetary compensation) you can claim substantially (or you may even be fully liable for your own injuries), as compared to if you had fallen into the drain because the drain was not covered properly,"" he said.
However, if a claimant is injured despite taking reasonable care to prevent the accident from occurring, it is most likely that the damages would not be reduced substantially, said Mr Razeen.

Factors that may work against the claimant include whether there were any safety measures or signs put in place, the size or visibility of the hazard and whether the claimant ought to have been aware of the hazard, said Mr Tang.
The court will also consider whether the incident could have been avoided if the claimant paid more care and attention.
PAST CASES
There have been cases where an amicable settlement was reached between parties after the lawsuit commenced, said Mr Wijaya. These include a woman who sued PUB for S$5 million after falling into a manhole.

Club hostess who took lift from drunk customer sues him over traffic accident, court finds him 75% liable 













Most suits nowadays are settled privately during mediation, with the terms confidential, said Ms Choo.
If, for example, a claimant is found to be 30 per cent liable such as in the case of a claimant who jaywalked and got into a motor accident, he would get only 70 per cent of the award, she said. For example, he would get S$70,000 if the award is S$100,000, after deducting 30 per cent.
""Applying that to the case of falling into the drain, if for example, there is CCTV footage of the claimant blatantly disregarding his or her own safety and taking the risk, and that resulted in him or her falling in the drain, then the claimant needs to take some blame and thus will only get the awarded sum less the liability that the court says he or she will bear,"" said Ms Choo.
Mr Tang gave the example of a resident of the Equatorial condominium, who successfully sued the management corporation for negligence after he slipped on a puddle of water and oil in the car park of the estate.
The High Court found the claimant to be 75 per cent liable for his own injuries due to his own negligence, he said.
In another case, a 68-year-old man successfully sued Vicom Inspection Centre after he fell into a 2m-deep pit at the Bukit Batok inspection centre, said Mr Tang.
The court found that the claimant was careless and had failed to keep a proper lookout, which resulted in the fall. He was awarded only 10 per cent of the damages which were to be assessed.
Mr Tang said the liability of a party depends on the facts of the case. The entity itself or its agents are ultimately responsible for the management, maintenance and safety of the space, he said.
""At the same time, the users themselves have to bear responsibility and care for their own actions."""
"Cough, cold syrup linked to child kidney injuries overseas not distributed in Singapore: HSA","HSA says it has not received any reports about acute kidney injury or deaths in children related to the consumption of contaminated liquid-based medicines.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cough-cold-syrup-child-kidney-deaths-injuries-not-sold-singapore-3020816,"SINGAPORE: A list of cough syrup and liquid-based medications that have been associated with kidney injuries and deaths in children overseas are not registered in Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said on Saturday (Oct 22).
""Based on our surveillance, these medicines have not been detected locally so far,"" said HSA in a media release.
""We have also not received any serious adverse events reports of acute kidney injury or deaths in children related to the consumption of contaminated syrup and liquid-based medicines from our healthcare professionals.""
On Oct 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued an alert over four cough and cold syrups made by Maiden Pharmaceuticals in India, warning that the products could be linked to the deaths of more than 60 children in the Gambia.
Laboratory analysis found ""unacceptable"" amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which can be toxic and lead to acute kidney injury, said the WHO.
Last week, Indonesia temporarily banned sales of all syrup-based medications as it investigates a spike in children who died from acute kidney injury. 
The country's food and drug agency also named five locally-made products which contained excessive levels of ethylene glycol and has ordered the producers to pull them out of circulation and destroy all remaining batches.
The signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury include confusion, nausea, shortness of breath, tiredness, decreased urine output, as well as swelling in the legs, ankles and around the eyes due to fluid retention.

HSA said all syrup and liquid-based medicines are required to meet the stipulated international standards of quality, safety and efficacy before it approves the medication for sale in Singapore.  
""HSA assesses the clinical studies data, manufacturing and quality control processes, and conducts checks to ensure that manufacturers conform to international Good Manufacturing Practice standards,"" it added.
After medicines are allowed for sale in Singapore, manufacturers are required to test all batches for levels of contaminants before selling them here.
The agency said it also regularly inspects local licensed manufacturers, importers and distributors to ensure compliance with the required standards.
""HSA monitors adverse events and conducts risk-based product testing, including for contaminants in medicines,"" it added.
Members of the public are strongly advised to exercise caution when buying health products online or from unfamiliar overseas sources, said the agency. 
""HSA will continue to monitor the situation closely and will also step up our surveillance checks to ensure that medicines available locally continue to be safe for use,"" it added.

"Richard Branson invited to debate with Shanmugam on Singapore’s anti-drugs policy, death penalty","The British billionaire, who has spoken against Singapore's death penalty, made false assertions in a recent blog post, says the Home Affairs Ministry as it invited him to a live televised debate.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/richard-branson-live-debate-k-shanmugam-drugs-death-penalty-mha-singapore-3020736,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said it has invited British billionaire Richard Branson to Singapore for a live televised debate with its minister K Shanmugam on the country's approach towards drugs and the death penalty. 
Mr Branson has been vocal in his views against Singapore's death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking, most recently in a blog post on Oct 10. Earlier this year, he spoke out against the execution of convicted drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam.
In response to his blog post, MHA said in a media release on Saturday (Oct 22) that he made false assertions about alleged racial bias and the treatment of defence lawyers. 
The ministry also reiterated Singapore's stance on drugs, saying that the capital sentence has had a clear deterrent effect on drug traffickers in Singapore.
""Our priority is to protect Singapore and Singaporeans from the scourge of drugs,"" said MHA. ""We take a comprehensive harm prevention approach, which includes the use of the death penalty for traffickers who traffic large amounts of drugs and seek to profit from destroying other people’s lives and livelihoods.""
In inviting Mr Branson to a debate on the issue, MHA said: ""Mr Branson’s flight to and accommodation in Singapore will be paid for.
""Mr Branson may use this platform to demonstrate to Singaporeans the error of our ways and why Singapore should do away with laws that have kept our population safe from the global scourge of drug abuse.""

In his blog post on Oct 10, Mr Branson said that Nagaenthran had a “well-documented intellectual disability” and was hanged despite that.
""We have clarified on several occasions that this is untrue. The Singapore Courts held that Nagaenthran knew what he was doing and that he was not intellectually disabled,"" MHA said on Saturday. 
""Mr Branson also suggests that Singapore had breached our international commitments to protect people with disabilities by carrying out the capital punishment on Nagaenthran. This too is untrue, as Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled.""
Mr Branson also alluded to the suspicion of alleged racial bias and that those executed in recent times were small-scale drug traffickers.
""This assertion is false. Mr Branson probably picked it up from some activists in Singapore with their own agendas,"" the ministry said.
""Our laws and procedures apply equally to all, regardless of background, nationality, race, education level or financial status. Every person who faces a capital offence is accorded full due process under the law. Their trials are transparent and open to the public and media.""
Defence lawyers have never been penalised for representing and defending accused people, said MHA in response to the businessman's claims of ""harassment"" of lawyers. 
""However, this does not mean that lawyers can abuse the court process by filing late and patently unmeritorious applications to frustrate the carrying out of lawfully imposed sentences,"" the ministry said, pointing to Nagaenthran’s case.
""Mr Branson is entitled to his opinions,"" it added.
""These opinions may be widely held in the UK, but we do not accept that Mr Branson or others in the West are entitled to impose their values on other societies. Nor do we believe that a country that prosecuted two wars in China in the 19th century to force the Chinese to accept opium imports has any moral right to lecture Asians on drugs.""
Singapore's policies on drugs and the death penalty derive from the country's own experience, said MHA, adding: ""Nothing we have seen in the UK or in the West persuades us that adopting a permissive attitude towards drugs and a tolerant position on drug trafficking will increase human happiness.
""Where drug addiction is concerned, things have steadily worsened in the UK, while things have steadily improved in Singapore.""

CNA Explains: Auction lots that shatter estimates. Is that vase in your storeroom worth a fortune?,"What triggers a price surge at auctions and how often does it happen? CNA finds out from experts at two auction houses.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-auction-chinese-vase-valuable-3015546,"SINGAPORE: In October, a seemingly ordinary Chinese vase sold for an astronomical sum of money at an auction near Paris.
Valued at a respectable €2,000 (US$1,966), it sparked a bidding war among about 30 people at the auction in Fontainebleau, and eventually sold for €7.7 million – or €9.12 million including fees.
Auction lots actually exceed their estimates significantly on a fairly regular basis, though perhaps not by 4,000 times as seen for that tianqiuping, or ""celestial sphere vase"".
This is particularly true in the realm of Chinese art and ceramics.
So how does this happen? How often does this happen? And could something you own be the next object to spark a bidding war?
To find out, CNA spoke to experts at two auction houses.
How does this happen?
Auction house Sotheby's is used to works soaring well above their estimates, said Mr Nicolas Chow, its worldwide head and chairman of Chinese works of art.
""Those are usually top-quality pieces fresh to market and collections with impeccable provenance,"" he said.
However, the expertise of specialists at top-tier auction houses means that they are unlikely to see margins like the one in Fontainebleau, Mr Chow added.
""We pride ourselves in our expertise and so our estimates are much more calibrated to the market than what might for example happen in a small country sale in France where one sometimes finds 'sleepers', that is, objects of great value and historical importance that have not been recognised as such and are under-catalogued,"" he said.
New discoveries made after an estimate has been agreed upon can also send prices surging, said Ms Gigi Yu, Bonhams' head of Chinese ceramics and works of art for Hong Kong.
""This can be a newfound prestigious provenance, research-proved evidence on its rarity or importance in history, or anything that speaks in favour of the value of the object,"" she said.
""While auction house specialists are professionally trained to price the works as accurately as possible, collectors of Chinese art can themselves be deeply knowledgeable about what they collect too, so occasionally these discoveries can also come from them.""
A key factor in the price of the tianqiuping skyrocketing was the bidding war that it triggered. So what are the elements that can contribute to this kind of interest?
Ms Yu and Mr Chow both spoke of the significance of an object being fresh to the market.
""Generally speaking, objects that are fresh to the market, in good condition and with a trusted provenance are sought after in the market,"" Ms Yu said.
""As to whether it triggers the bidding war, other factors – sometimes subjective – weigh in as well, just like any other items offered at auction.""
Mr Chow said that other factors include rarity, beauty, condition, historical importance, provenance and fashion.
""All these parameters will be calibrated differently depending on the period and nature of the work,"" he said.
""Generally speaking, fresh and outstanding property, regardless of category – ceramics, paintings, jewellery, et cetera – is always highly sought-after.
""Objects can be controversial and sometimes our conservative estimates and guarantee lines will reflect a diversity of opinions.""

How often does this happen?
Even if lots don’t sell for 4,000 times their estimates at auction houses like Sotheby’s and Bonhams, estimates can still be exceeded by significant margins.
Ms Yu recalled one example: A white jade cup that Bonhams offered at auction in London back in May 2013.
Estimated to be worth somewhere in the region of £8,000 to £12,000, it ended up selling for £133,250 (about US$202,000 at the time).
""I handled the sale of a rare white jade two-handled 'deer' cup, which went on to sell for 16 times the estimate,"" she said.
""It could achieve that high because of the rarity of the piece, especially the deer handles and the fanggu mark, as well as for the quality of the stone. Also, the market was quite robust at that time.""
According to Bonhams, jade pieces carved with the Qianlong fanggu mark were inspired by archaic bronzes. This reflected the desire of the Qianlong Emperor to draw moral strength and righteousness from the examples of the ancients.
A bidding war at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong on Oct 8 this year, meanwhile, pushed the value of a rare Ming dynasty chair to nearly 10 times its estimate.
The huanghuali folding horseshoe-back armchair had an estimated value of between HK$10 million and HK$15 million (US$1.27 million to US$1.91 million), but a ""15-minute frenzy"" in which more than 60 bids were made sent its price up to more than HK$124 million.
""It is an auction record for a Chinese chair, the second-most valuable piece of Chinese classical furniture sold at auction, and the third highest price paid for any chair on the secondary market,"" said Mr Chow.
In the world of Chinese ceramics, an estimate of HK$100 million can still be doubled and nearly tripled, as was the case for a Northern Song dynasty-era brush washer at a Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong in October 2017.
Twenty minutes of tense bidding saw the millennium-old Ru ware piece sell for HK$294.3 million (about US$37.7 million at the time), a world record for Chinese ceramics at the time.
















How do you find out if you own something valuable?
An estimate itself can also be a significant step up from what an object was originally purchased for, when auction houses recognise artefacts for what they really are.
Mr Chow pointed out the example of a 15th-century Chinese bowl that was bought for US$35 at a yard sale near New Haven, Connecticut, and later identified as a rare Ming dynasty artefact.
Its value shot up to US$300,000 to US$500,000 when Sotheby's offered it at auction in New York in March 2021, and it was eventually sold for US$721,800 according to news agency UPI.
So how can someone find out if there are treasures among the objects they own?
""An easy way is to bring it to a reputable auction house that has a strong track record of dealing in that particular category,"" said Ms Yu.
""But again, Chinese art is a discipline that requires deep knowledge and experience to understand – I would recommend collectors to do as much homework as possible.
""The more they see, read and handle, the more they can discern what is great from good.""
Mr Chow shared similar guidance, recommending that owners contact Sotheby's unless they are professionals.
""We have a team of specialists ready to advise you on any property that you have, from old master paintings, to Chinese works of art, handbags, jewels or sneakers, and their contacts are easily found on our website,"" he said, adding that the specialists review such submissions at no cost.
When it comes to collecting, however, Ms Yu had these words of advice: ""I would always recommend my clients to buy what they truly love, instead of thinking they should only get what can potentially shoot really high up at auction.
""The reality is that, in most cases, you would probably not be the only person spotting the potential. But if you own a piece that you truly like, that would belong to you and you alone.""

"IN FOCUS: They get curious looks and are called 'uncle', but young bus drivers say the job has evolved","The job of driving a bus has been associated with middle-aged people working long hours for low pay, but a new generation of young drivers say things have changed for the better.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/young-bus-driver-salary-sbs-smrt-3005816,"SINGAPORE: Mr Muhammad As-Syaqif Hasanus has been driving SMRT buses for four-and-a-half years, long enough for him to take all of the job's challenges in his stride.
The 29-year-old has dealt with drunk passengers, sucked on sweets to push him through long journeys, and navigated unpredictable traffic conditions to keep to a tight schedule.
There is one thing, however, that still gets under his skin: Commuters, often middle-aged women, calling him ""uncle"".
""Uncle? What uncle? I am ah boy,"" he joked about how he would respond. ""If (an older man) calls me uncle, I will say: 'Not me uncle. You uncle.'""

Mr As-Syaqif is part of a still small but growing group of younger bus drivers in Singapore, a testament to how the industry and perceptions of it have changed in recent years.
His TikTok channel yourbuscaptain, started in 2021 during the pandemic, has 30,000 followers and features videos of his daily life on the job and educational pointers on buses.
He said his videos, which regularly attract tens of thousands of views, try to tell the public that his job is ""not just about driving"".
""I think it has changed over the years,"" he told CNA at the Kranji bus depot on Oct 13, when asked about perceptions of the job as low-paying with long hours.
""I think everything is quite attractive now in terms of benefits and stuff like that. There are good prospects in the public transport industry. Public transport is everywhere.""
















NOT MANY YOUNG DRIVERS
Still, being a public bus driver in Singapore is not what people would normally associate with someone below 30 years old.
SMRT told CNA that only a ""small percentage"" of its bus captains are under 30, and that while it has seen a ""surge of interest"" in the job in recent years, majority of these people are older.
""From our experience, we have found that many young adults are not looking for shift work and prefer fixed office hours,"" said SMRT Buses deputy managing director Vincent Gay.

An SMRT bus driver meets a Pathlight student on the train. Then a Facebook post goes viral













Fellow public transport operator SBS Transit said it recognises that being a bus captain can be challenging due to the ""operational"" nature of the job.
The operator has more than 350 drivers who are younger than 30, although it did not give a percentage figure or say how many of these drivers are local. Its youngest driver is 21 years old, the minimum age for the job.
""Shift work, work schedules that can start as early as 4.30am or end as late as 1.30am and being on the road all the time are the norm,"" said Mrs Grace Wu, vice-president (special grade) of customer experience and communications at SBS Transit.
Public bus drivers usually work six days a week across different shifts. Two common ones are the AM and PM shift, which run from 5am to 12.20pm and 1.30pm to 8pm respectively.
Drivers, however, can work more than 10 hours per shift. Anything above seven hours and 20 minutes is considered overtime.
SALARY EVOLUTION
Then there is that notion that being a bus driver is a low-paying job.
When private bus driver Muhammad Naz Farihin Muhammad Farhan, 25, first entered the industry full-time in 2020, he said some family members doubted if it would be a viable long-term career.
""School friends probably thought it would be a waste of time or a low-end job as what most people would say,"" the former SMRT bus driver told CNA.

On a Reddit thread posted in September last year, a user who said they worked as a bus driver highlighted that monthly entry salaries were less than S$1,600 before the Land Transport Authority (LTA) introduced the bus contracting model in 2016.
The model brings all public buses and related infrastructure under government ownership, while public transport operators bid for the right to run bus services along different routes, LTA said on its website.
""The tendering process drives competition in the bus industry and encourages operators to become more responsive to changes in ridership and commuter needs,"" the authority said.
After the change, bus driver salaries ""shot up"" to S$1,900 and have increased to more than S$2,000 a month for first-time drivers today, the Reddit user wrote.
This is backed up by Mr Naz, who said public bus drivers can now earn a starting salary of between S$2,000 and S$2,200 a month, excluding a joining bonus, incentives and overtime pay.
SBS Transit said on its website that entry-level bus captains can get an all-in gross salary of up to S$4,000 a month, with a sign-on bonus of S$6,000 for locals who get the job.

Mr Naz said the ""key takeaway"" of working with older, long-time drivers at SMRT was seeing how the industry has progressed since years back.
""Bus drivers were being paid below 'minimum wage' back then, and knowing how times have changed for the better for most of us, it definitely shows that the industry has come a long way,"" he said.
""There are many more opportunities that a bus captain can do, and it's not just a standard blue-collar job as what has been described by many.""
Public transport operator Tower Transit said it has seen a 64 per cent increase in the number of bus drivers below 30 years old joining the company since the first quarter of this year, although only slightly over 2 per cent of its drivers fall in this age bracket.
""The challenge is that people don’t typically aspire to become a bus captain until they start driving and realise that it can be a fulfilling career, that they are respected and that there are career progression opportunities,"" said Mr Winston Toh, managing director of Tower Transit Singapore.
Mr Toh, highlighting a perception that all drivers do is drive, said the job has evolved into a ""multi-faceted role"" that involves interacting with hundreds of people daily.
""It is as much a customer service job as a driving one, and because road conditions and human interactions are so dynamic, no two days are the same,"" he added.
""Many of our younger bus captains enjoy that dynamism and a few have even moved into supervisory and managerial roles.""
CAREER PROGRESSION
Mrs Wu of SBS Transit said the operator has introduced a progressive wage model and career progression paths for its bus captains. For instance, ""good performers"" can be promoted to senior bus captains and then chief bus captains.
Drivers can also opt for a management track with non-driving roles, which include executive and managerial roles in bus interchange and depot operations and management, bus operations control centres and training.
""In recent years, we have also introduced new work schemes such as part-time and five-day work week to make it more attractive for job applicants to consider joining the profession,"" she said.

Public transport operator Go-Ahead said it has observed an ""encouraging trend"" of younger bus captains coming on board in recent years.
Among them is a 23-year-old who joined in June in what is his first full-time job after graduating from the Institute of Technical Education with a Higher Nitec.
""Younger bus captains contribute to the sustainability and diversity of our public transport workforce,"" a Go-Ahead spokesperson said.
""They bring with them fresh experience and new perspectives in an industry that has seen rapid development through the years.""
STARTING YOUNG
This is echoed by A&S Transit, a private bus charter company that Mr Naz is currently working for.
As the pandemic eased, the company bought over old public buses that were converted to transport COVID-19 patients, attracting the interest of young bus enthusiasts who followed these rarer buses through their service.
""They started to interact with us and take care of this fleet on their own accord,"" said A&S Transit general manager Dexter Ang, 36, adding that the company eventually offered some of them part-time driving jobs.
""Through that process, we started to see that actually there's a lot of potential in this community, because they come from different backgrounds. Some of them were studying engineering, some were from a business studies background.""






      The community of young bus drivers in A&S Transit calls itself F.A.S.T. (Photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin)
    






The bus enthusiasts knew a lot about the buses, to the extent of understanding how to track their petrol usage and manage their maintenance, Mr Ang said.
""We thought why not take this as a chance to revolutionise the industry and try to change people's perception that it's not an 'uncle' kind of industry anymore,"" he added.
""There might be a future where you have young people coming to drive buses and it starts from the fundamentals of knowing about the buses.""
A&S Transit, whose jobs include ferrying students on school trips and foreign workers to their dorms, has around seven part-time and full-time bus drivers between 21 and 25 years old.






      A&S Transit bus driver Dionte Lee. (Photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin)
    






The youngest is 21-year-old polytechnic student and bus enthusiast Dionte Lee, who decided to drive buses part-time after Mr Naz introduced him to the industry two years ago.
""It kind of suits my school schedule, because it's a very flexible job that accommodates my timing,"" he said.
As the clock struck midnight on his 21st birthday, Mr Lee went online to apply for his bus driver's vocational licence, a requirement to drive a private-hire bus.
In the morning, he dragged his bus enthusiast friends to the Singapore Safety Driving Centre in Woodlands to apply for a Class 4 driving licence, which he needed to drive the type of buses in A&S Transit's fleet.
AGE IS A NUMBER
Mr Lee took about a month to get both licences and started driving for A&S on Aug 16. These first two months have been ""very stressful"", he said, citing congestion on Singapore roads.
""Driving such a big vehicle, you get very tense. I have to manoeuvre this around town,"" he said, noting that private buses, unlike their public counterparts, do not ply fixed and vetted routes.
""So, it's kind of really based on our own judgment to see whether the buses can pass through all those small roads.""
Mr Lee said he has received curious looks from passengers due to his young appearance, recounting how this happened when he drove tourists to sites like Fort Canning.
""The tour guide boarded the bus and during her free time, she came forward and asked me: 'Are you sure you're a bus captain? You don't really look like a middle-aged guy,'"" he said.
""I said yes, I am 21 years old. She was very shocked and gave me that stunned look. It was a very funny situation, to be honest. There are definitely more similar situations which happened throughout my career in this company.""

Mr Ang, the A&S general manager, acknowledged that the company initially had reservations about whether these drivers could do a good job given their young age and lack of experience.
""But as time goes by, they really proved us wrong. Like I mentioned, the background that they bring with them and the kind of knowledge that they have on buses, a lot of times they become almost like our adviser,"" he said.
""Even in terms of their safety and driving skill, because of their knowledge of the buses, a lot of times they actually even perform better than our older drivers.""

These young drivers have also created their own community within the company and started posting TikTok videos about their profession, and Mr Ang said these efforts seem to be ""slowly changing"" how the job is perceived.
""Sometimes during our events we have kids as young as like six years old coming to see the buses,"" he said.
""Their parents will find out more about bus driving and the industry, and they start to have the perception that maybe it's not that bad that young people, potentially their children, can consider this industry in the future.""
Mr Ang hopes parents see that a viable career could be carved out of driving buses, as he encouraged the industry as a whole to embrace younger drivers.
""We hope that the industry can see the potential in them and see what they can bring with them, with their background and their passion,"" he added.
""GETTING PAID IS JUST A BONUS""
Indeed, Mr Naz's passion for buses started as an eight-year-old asking his dad to take him out for joyrides around the island. He grew up collecting bus toys and when social media popped up, he joined a bus enthusiast community.
The members attended launch events for new models and services, snapped photos of older buses that were being phased out, and documented their journeys on these workhorses. But Mr Naz wanted more.
""The dream of getting behind the wheel of a bus was definitely a thriller for me. Especially after taking the older-generation bendy buses out of Woodlands, it would be nice to sit behind the wheel and drive out of your own town to serve passengers,"" he said.
""I'm someone who actually likes meeting new people every day and getting to know people on my trips. Having that mentality is something that pushed me to join the public transport operator industry.""

In 2020, Mr Naz joined SMRT as a bus captain, a job that came with its own set of challenges.
He has reported to bus depots at 3.30am and handled passengers who complained about wait times. Some of the routes he was on dragged on for more than two hours, and he often found himself counting down the stops to the end of the journey.
But he said bus drivers are trained to handle a range of situations in a job where no single day is ""ordinary"".
""If you put your heart and mind into it, especially doing something you love, getting paid is just a bonus,"" he said, recalling how he fulfilled a childhood dream by driving service 911 out of Woodlands bus interchange - a route he frequented while growing up.

Earlier this year, Mr Naz left SMRT for A&S Transit because the new job had more flexible hours. It also paid more and offered him a chance to progress into areas like transport planning. On top of his driving duties, he currently manages A&S' fleet of former public buses.
Like SMRT bus captain Mr As-Syaqif, Mr Naz gets called ""uncle"" too. But he accepts that this is part of the job.
""Sadly, this is just one of the few things I signed up for the moment I get behind the wheel. Normally, people don't really see the age characteristic before they start speaking,"" he said. 
""But I think it's just a way of life for me as of now. But if people do know the real age, some of them may be very, very surprised.""
NO ORDINARY DAY
Unlike Mr Naz, Mr As-Syaqif did not decide to become a bus driver because he was an enthusiast.
The former nurse at a public hospital had grown tired of the job despite having a passion for it, so he decided to become a private-hire driver for Uber, which was still operating in Singapore at the time.
During this time, Mr As-Syaqif developed a fondness for driving, and it was on one of his Uber trips that he drove past SMRT's Ang Mo Kio bus depot and saw an advertisement for bus captains.
""The joining salary was okay, and I went for an interview and got the job on the spot,"" he said.

Mr As-Syaqif likened driving a bus to his former nursing job in that both professions serve the public, saying that his family had no issues with his choice of career. 
""My family is not the type that says bus captains have low education and no future. They're okay as long as I am happy and have a stable income,"" he said.
Mr As-Syaqif said he enjoys meeting new people on the job, especially tourists on service 972 that goes to Orchard Road. There are also commuters on feeder services that have taken a liking to him and specifically choose to board his bus.
He agreed that every day as a bus driver is different, recalling how he personally attended to an elderly commuter who was sleeping on the bus when he fell and injured his head.

In 2021, he was driving a full double-decker bus - service 190 - on the expressway when he heard a loud thud. He looked behind and saw a passenger lying flat on the floor, so he stopped the bus on the road shoulder.
Mr As-Syaqif called the police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) before rendering first aid. When paramedics arrived, the passenger was already bandaged. Mr As-Syaqif, who also did his National Service with SCDF, told them he was a first-aider.
""People usually have the misconception that bus captains are uncles with low education, but I have a nursing certificate,"" he said.
""It's how you see the whole picture - sometimes your nursing certificate can bring you to a lot of places, like being a bus captain. So it's like to me, if you have a passion for driving and you don't want to work in an office, then go for it.""

Mr Naz said it is not wrong to explore opportunities and try out something new, adding that people can learn new skills and earn a decent salary as a bus driver.
""There are no boundaries to how young or old you have to be to be driving a bus. Try to keep a clear mindset and be open to multiple opportunities,"" he added.

Singapore hospitals seeing high number of patients who do not need emergency care: Healthcare groups,"Three major healthcare groups in Singapore said they will take a zero-tolerance stance towards the deliberate abuse of staff.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/emergency-department-hospitals-long-wait-times-healthcare-staff-abuse-3019966,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's hospitals are seeing a high number of patients whose conditions do not require emergency care, three major healthcare groups said in a joint statement on Friday (Oct 21).
Where possible, manpower has been redeployed to better support the high attendance at hospital emergency departments, said the group chairmen of the medical boards of SingHealth, National Healthcare Group and National University Health System.
""We have been monitoring the situation closely and adjusting our response accordingly to optimise resources for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,"" said the statement.
The hospitals' triage process includes having emergency clinicians review the cases for admissions to ensure appropriate right-siting and avoid unnecessary admission.
Since the start of the year, emergency departments have been experiencing a very high volume of patients.
""This is aggravated when there is an infection wave, such as over the past few weeks,"" said the statement.
""We are working closely with the Ministry of Health to optimise and adjust capacity, resources, protocols, and manpower to care for our patients and keep our staff safe.""
The waiting time for admission at some hospitals has surged to as high as 50 hours.

PRIORITY FOR PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS CONDITIONS
To free up more capacity, some non-urgent elective surgeries and admissions are also being deferred. This will help to preserve hospital beds and manpower, said the statement.
Priority will be given to patients with more serious conditions and who require admission. Those with potentially life-threatening or medically urgent conditions will be attended to quickly, and sicker patients who require close monitoring will get a bed sooner based on acuity and priority, they said.
Patients with lower acuity conditions will experience a longer wait time to transfer to the ward.
Inpatient care will start at the emergency department with specialty doctors reviewing, assessing and planning for the appropriate treatment before the ward transfer. 
""We seek the public’s understanding that longer waiting time is expected at our emergency departments,"" said the group chairmen of the medical boards.
They urged people, including children, not to visit the emergency departments unless it is for life-threatening conditions.
""For common and minor medical conditions, they should visit GPs and polyclinics, or consider teleconsultation with their doctor,"" the statement said.
Patients who walk into emergency departments with non-emergency conditions may be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment. This is to prioritise the resources for those who need acute hospital care.

Members of the public who need COVID-19 testing or a review of acute respiratory infection symptoms can visit the Public Health Preparedness Clinics for further assessment.
Stable patients are referred to home recovery programmes, such as NUHS@Home, SGH@Home and Yishun Health Medical Home, or community sites such as COVID-19 treatment facilities as appropriate. 
""There are dedicated facilities and manpower to support the care of COVID-19 patients,"" the statement said. 
Hospitals have set aside beds that can be converted to isolation beds, and holding facilities for suspect cases pending their results. 
Alternative arrangements, where clinically appropriate, are also offered. These include teleconsultation, telerehabilitation, telemonitoring, remote prescribing, and delivery of medication.

STAFF WELFARE
""As part of the national efforts against COVID-19, our healthcare team has held the line for Singapore with significant personal sacrifices,"" said the statement.
""While we work hard to provide care for our patients, we recognise our staff need time to rest and recharge.""
Besides the heavy workload and long working hours, a significant part of staff burnout is also due to abuse, they added.
""We take a zero-tolerance stance towards deliberate abuse against our staff and will take action to protect them,"" they added.
""There are protocols in place that assure staff they can safely seek redress from abuse they may face from patients and caregivers, and get the support they need. We seek the public’s patience and cooperation to help create a safe environment for our staff to do their best to care for patients.""
Staffing needs are managed through advance planning and staggered rostering of leave. This ensures that staff are able to go on leave by turns, or return to their home country. 
""Given the prolonged duration of this pandemic, we have stepped up efforts to monitor the well-being of our staff, including their psychological health,"" the group chairmen of the medical boards said.
""We provide mental health support where required, and encourage staff to support and look out for one another."""
"More safeguards should be included in ‘Buy now, pay later’ code of conduct: CASE","Consumers should be allowed to set purchase limits for themselves, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) suggested.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/case-more-safeguards-buy-now-pay-later-code-conduct-3019791,"SINGAPORE: The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) is calling for more safeguards to be included into a newly-announced code of conduct for “Buy now, pay later” (BNPL) providers, including a lower cap on maximum purchases for users below 21 years old.
In a Facebook post on Friday (Oct 21), CASE president Melvin Yong said the industry code was “a step forward but more can be done”.
BNPL allows users to pay for purchases over time. It differs from usual instalment plans by enabling one to split the cost for small-ticket everyday items at zero interest and without having to own a credit card.
To address concerns about potential debt accumulation, the code of conduct – announced on Thursday by a working group led by the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA) – sets out several guidelines such as platforms imposing a S$2,000 limit on outstanding payments for each customer unless additional credit worthiness assessments are done.
But Mr Yong said there should be a lower limit on the maximum purchases allowed for those under 21, as the majority of younger consumers between the ages of 18 and 21 do not earn an income.
The code states that BNPL providers can only offer their services to those who are at least 18 years old.
Mr Yong also suggested that consumers be allowed to set purchase limits for themselves so as to guard against ""excessive and untenable monthly instalments”.
 
“We hope that SFA and the BNPL working group will review these considerations and refine the code of conduct to further safeguard the interests of consumers,” he wrote.

In June, CASE raised concerns about the rising use of BNPL services, which it described as potentially giving consumers a “false perception of increased purchasing power”, leading them to spend beyond their means.
The consumer watchdog noted that it received 18 complaints involving BNPL services over the past one-and-a-half-years, and urged for consumer safeguards to be put in place.
Several of its suggestions, such as setting limits for both consumers and BNPL providers, regulating advertisements and ensuring a clear recourse avenue for consumers, have since been included in the code of conduct, said Mr Yong.
“I’m also glad to see that the code of conduct incorporates consumer-friendly practices like allowing consumers to make full repayment at any time without any early repayment fees and allowing consumers to voluntarily exclude themselves from BNPL services and promotional materials,” he added.
The new code will also require BNPL providers to undergo an audit and accreditation process before being awarded a trustmark to show that they are compliant. In addition, the industry is looking to set up a credit information sharing bureau. These are expected to be completed by late-2023.
Mr Yong, in his Facebook post, said CASE is looking forward to hearing more about these initiatives, although it hopes that they can “be expedited so that consumers who intend to use BNPL services can approach service providers compliant with the code of conduct”.
Meanwhile, Mr Yong urged consumers looking to use BNPL services to understand the terms and conditions before entering into a BNPL agreement, as well as set aside money for monthly instalments.
Those who encounter disputes with BNPL service providers can also approach CASE for assistance, he added."
5 workers in Ang Mo Kio protest were owed salaries; payments settled in full by employer: MOM,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ang-mo-kio-protest-workers-payments-settled-mom-3019431,"SINGAPORE: Five of the workers who protested outside a building in Ang Mo Kio this week were owed salaries, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Friday (Oct 21).
These outstanding payments have since been settled in full by the workers' employer, Zhengda Corporation, MOM said in a Facebook post.
MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) had been assisting the 10 migrant workers from Zhengda Corporation who were involved in the incident on Oct 18. Earlier reports stated that there were nine workers involved, however, this number was revised.
""We have found that five of the 10 workers were owed salary payments. We have assisted all five workers with their salary claims, and Zhengda Corporation has since settled the payments in full,"" MOM said.
""We have also verified that the other five workers as well as the rest of Zhengda Corporation's workforce are not owed salary payments and did not report any well-being concerns thus far.""
MOM has also found that Shanghai Chong Kee owes salary payments to their migrant workers, said the ministry, adding that MOM and TADM are currently assisting these workers.
Both Shanghai Chong Kee and Zhengda Corporation are being investigated for possible offences under the Employment Act, it added.
On Tuesday afternoon, the workers blocked the entrance and exit of the building at 5 Ang Mo Kio Street 62, holding up signs with the company name Shanghai Chong Kee in Mandarin and demanding their salaries.
On Wednesday, the company's safety director said that the protest was over a payment dispute between his company and subcontractor Zhengda Corporation.
He said that six of the men were engaged by Shanghai Chong Kee for renovation work at the Ang Mo Kio site.
According to Zhengda Corporation, Shanghai Chong Kee did not make payment for weeks. The latter had since issued two cheques, Zhengda Corporation's project director said on Wednesday.
MOM said that the well-being of Singapore's workforce, including its migrant workers, is always its priority.
""MOM and TADM will continue to help workers who face salary issues and assist them in recovering their salaries,"" the ministry said, adding it is also working with the Migrant Workers' Centre and the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union to help with the well-being of workers.
Migrant workers who require assistance with regard to salary issues can contact MOM at 6438 5122 or TADM via its website."

Eligible healthcare workers may walk in to any of the nine Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) offering the Moderna/Spikevax vaccines to get the jab.
They will be required to produce a valid staff pass for identification at the JTVCs.
Those without passes may produce a memo bearing the company or organisation’s letterhead or official stamp as proof, said MOH.
""Separate arrangements may be made by the respective healthcare institutions to provide in-house vaccination to facilitate those who are not able to visit the JTVCs due to work exigencies,"" said the ministry.

On Thursday, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said that Singapore plans to invite people aged between 18 and 49 to take their COVID-19 bivalent vaccines later in the year as more supplies are secured.
According to Mr Ong, bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines.
The bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine is expected to be available in Singapore by the end of the year. 
Children aged six months to four years can begin to receive their primary vaccination with the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine from Oct 25.
Those aged between five and 11 will be able to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine as a booster dose.

CNA Explains: How does Article 156 in the Constitution 'protect' marriage?,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-article-156-singapore-constitution-protect-marriage-repeal-377a-3019261,"SINGAPORE: Minister for Family and Social Affairs Zulkifli Masagos on Thursday (Oct 20) tabled a Bill to amend the Singapore Constitution to protect the current definition of marriage.
The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill seeks to introduce Article 156 which states, in short, that Parliament will have the power to define, regulate, protect and promote the institution of marriage. It has four subsections.
It was tabled in Parliament along with another Bill to repeal Section 377A - a law that criminalises sex between men.
What does Article 156 hope to achieve and why is it being proposed? CNA speaks to lawyers and experts to interpret the legal terms.





      Full text of Article 156
  

Institution of Marriage
156. (1) The Legislature may, by law, define, regulate, protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage.
(2) Subject to any written law, the Government and any public authority may, in the exercise of their executive authority, protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage.
(3) Nothing in Part 4 invalidates a law enacted before, on or after the date of commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Act 2022 by reason that the law - 
defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman; or
is based on such a definition of marriage
(4) Nothing in Part 4 invalidates an exercise of executive authority before, on or after the date of commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Act 2022 by reason that the exercise is based on a definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.”

HOW TO INTERPRET ARTICLE 156?
The key clause in part (1) of the Article is that Parliament has the power to define the institution of marriage.
What it hopes to achieve is that Parliament will have sole power to define what marriage is and such definition by Parliament will not be subject to legal challenge, said Mr Suang Wijaya, lawyer at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP. 
The Article would make such challenges an “uphill task”, said the constitutional law practitioner.
Subsection 2 states that the executive, that is Government, would have the power to act to “further any purpose as to the current definition of marriage”, said Mr Wijaya. The word “define” is dropped from the text, but it seeks to cover all other functions with the terms “protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote”.

Bills to repeal 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage tabled in Parliament













The proposed Articles 156(3) and (4) refer to Part 4 of the Constitution, which contains constitutional rights provisions, such as the right to equality, said Assistant Professor of Law Benjamin Joshua Ong, from the Yong Pung How School of Law at the Singapore Management University (SMU).
“For example, Article 156(3) appears to prevent someone from arguing that the definition of marriage in the law violates the constitutional right to equality because it does not provide for same-sex marriage,” said Asst Prof Ong. Subsection 156(4) does the same for the executive or Government and its policies and measures.
SMU Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan said the intention is to “significantly reduce the likelihood of constitutional challenges on laws and government policies that are premised on marriage being that between a man and a woman”.
“The provision makes it plain and clear that what is a marriage is for Parliament to decide,” said Assoc Prof Tan.
He added: “The constitutional amendment Bill does not codify the definition of marriage in the Constitution. In so doing, it does not unnecessarily bind future governments and generations on the definition of marriage.”
WHY NOT “ENSHRINE” IT IN THE CONSTITUTION?
If defined in the Constitution, any future amendment to the definition of marriage would require a supermajority, or votes from two-thirds of the elected Members of Parliament and Non-Constituency MPs.
Asst Prof Ong said that by not doing so Parliament can change, by ordinary legislation, the definition of marriage that is currently set out in Singapore laws. This is now the case, and the proposed Article 156 would not change that.
Parliament can also, by ordinary legislation, create a system of civil unions, including same-sex civil unions. The proposed Article would not change that.
These can be amended or enacted with a simple majority of sitting MPs.
WHAT DOES IT PROTECT?
Article 156 does not enshrine the definition of marriage in the Constitution, but marriage is defined in other legislation.
Section 12 (1) in the Women’s Charter says that a marriage that is not between a man and a women is void.
It reads: “A marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between persons who, at the date of the marriage, are not respectively male and female is void.”
The Interpretation Act defines a “monogamous marriage” as “a voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others”.
There are various policies that are based on these definitions of marriage including public housing policies, financial benefits for married couples, adoption and media and education policies.
WHY NOW?
At the National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave two main reasons for the repeal of Section 377A and the proposed amendment to the Constitution to protect the traditional definition of marriage.
He said that society is now more accepting of homosexuality and that most accept that it should not be a crime for consenting men to have sex in private.
The other reason was there was a real risk that Section 377A could be overturned in a future court challenge, on the grounds that it breaches the equal protection provision in the Constitution.

NDR 2022: Singapore to repeal Section 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage













This refers to Article 12(1): All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
Article 12(2) adds “there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth” in any law or in other matters.
Professor Leslie Chew, Dean of the School of Law at the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that without the new Article 156, the way marriage is now defined may suffer challenges, the way Section 377A was.
“Hence, based on the Government’s sensing of the views of the majority of Singaporeans, Government in turn, takes the position that it ought to strengthen the legal status of the definition of marriage so that a constitutional challenge such as that which has been repeatedly mounted against 377A over a decade or so, will not occur,” said Prof Chew. 
He added: “Given the divisive nature of the issue, I believe Government is trying to balance the competing claims of the status quo and the evolving nature of modern life so as to ensure harmony within our society.”
COULD ARTICLE 156 BE CHALLENGED?
It is an undecided question in Singapore whether it is possible for the court to strike down constitutional provisions that are seen to be contrary to fundamental parts of the Constitution, said Mr Wijaya.
Asst Prof Ong said that one could use the “basic structure doctrine” to argue that that certain parts of the Constitution, such as the rights provisions in Part 4, are so “basic” that the Constitution cannot be amended to reduce the scope of those rights, which Article 156 arguably purports to do. 
“Our courts have not yet stated conclusively whether or not this theory applies in Singapore,” he said.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
The two Bills - one to repeal Section 377A and the other to amend the Constitution - were tabled for their first reading in Parliament on Oct 20.
There will be a second and third readings of the Bills at a subsequent sitting on Nov 28.
The Bills will be debated together but voted on separately. The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill can be passed with a simple majority.











The Constitution amendment Bill needs the assent of two-thirds of the 92 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs to pass. This means a total of 63 votes.
The ruling People’s Action Party has 83 MPs and the party whip will not be lifted for the vote.
All Bills need to be examined by the Presidential Council for Minority rights to make sure that it does not discriminate against any race or religion, and the President’s assent before being gazetted as law."

Singapore's preeminent - by virtue of being the only - chinese mythlogical theme park was built in 1937 by Tiger Balm mogul Aw Boon Haw as a tribute to his brother, Aw Boon Par. 
The 8.5 hectare park is also Singapore's largest outdoor art gallery, containing sculptures and large dioramas that depict scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore and literature works such as Journey To The West and Water Margin.
One of its most famous attractions is the Ten Courts of Hell - a trail depicting gruesome punishments in the afterlife and a prime location many parents brought their children to scare them into obedience.
Some of us even remember coming here for our primary school excursion and being such good kids after the visit.
The park closed for nine months in 2020 for upgrading works, reopening the next year boasting enhanced night lighting and conservation work on its statues.

However, for such a valuable link to Singapore's heritage and cultural past, there is a constant perception that the exhibits are not well-explained, a missed opportunity to impart parables and teachings from previous generations. 
As part of Singapore HeritageFest 2022 in May, audio tours narrated by local celebrities were made available for a number of statues at Haw Par Villa. 
Perhaps these audio tours can be made a more permanent fixture for those looking to initiate themselves into Chinese folklore at their own pace. 
Another point: The accessibility of these tours. It would benefit users if the tours could be accessed as part of an app or though dedicated devices that can be rented at the park's visitor centre.

DEMPSEY

Dempsey Hill, the home of high-end restaurants, grocers and galleries, was formerly a military barracks occupied by the British. 
Many of us associate Dempsey Hill with lazy brunches, a place teeming with expatriates and others with a bit more cash to splash. 
But plans are already under way by the SLA to make the area a lifestyle and green living destination. Tenders are set to be called, with some to possibly be filled by wellness and sports concepts.
SLA has also said that it will be looking out for sustainability initiatives among the proposals.
These plans have the aim of drawing larger crowds for purposes beyond eating, shopping and gazing at art.
Might we suggest a free outdoor play area like the likes of Coastal PlayGrove, the former East Coast Big Splash site, or Jurong Lake Gardens with a park that allows families to explore nature. 
With all the green in Dempsey, we could allocate a large swath of land dedicated to some fun - for both adults and children - at zero cost. 
Some tenants here have also noted accessibility to the area as something that can be improved on, which is a fair point to increase footfall to Dempsey Hill.
CHANGI VILLAGE

In the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Draft Master Plan in 2013, Changi Village was highlighted as an area marked for upgrades. 
The URA spoke of ""the beach and the rustic charms of Changi Village"", noting its strong historical legacy dating from the British colonial era. 
Back in the day, Changi Village was a busy market place for British troops who were based in the area until their withdrawal from Singapore in 1972.
The village's rustic charm and detachment from the hustle and bustle of everyday life is a unique experience in Singapore, partly due to the lack of high-rise buildings. There is an airport nearby, after all.
Now, the area contains eateries, resorts and chalets that have stood since the colonial years. Recreational amenities like golf courses and a sailing club can also be found around the area.
The Downtown Line and the upcoming Cross Island Line will open more options to commuters wishing to visit the idyllic coastline.
Changi Village Hawker Centre - which frequently sees long queues (nasi lemak fans will know) - was closed for repair and renovation works on Aug 15 and will remain closed until Nov 14.
The stretches of beaches here are also great spots for marine life enthusiasts. Join a tour with education centres that conducts intertidal walks or stroll down the shore in the evenings when the tide is as low as 0.6m. 
The beauty of Changi is that it is one of the few places on the main island that is still relatively ""untouched"".

ST JOHN'S ISLAND
Many Singaporeans have heard of St John's island but not all have visited this place, the largest of the country's Southern Islands. 
In the late 19th century, it was used as a quarantine station for immigrants with cholera. 
In more recent disease-stricken times, visits to the island underwent a momentary boom during the COVID-19 pandemic, as holiday destinations became slim pickings due to travel restrictions. 
The island is home to Singapore's only offshore marine research facility.
It is also part of Singapore Biennale 2022 - the first time the event will extend beyond the nation's shores.
Once off-limits to the public, Bendera Bay on the island reopened in 2021, with visitor able to do conservation activities like heritage tours and recreational fishing.
In March 2022, a pilot program explored the feasibility of food delivery via drones to St John's Island.
If successful, visitors to the island could be able to have their meals flown in, for an impromptu picnic.
While you can stay overnight on St John's Island, there aren't many nice rooming options. To be honest, they look more like dormitories than the Banyan Tree. 
We think this part of the St John's Island experience could do with a refresh.
Bring in some private operators to create eco-friendly resorts, invite farm-to-table restauranteurs for an enjoyable dining experience, again - build in businesses as part of nature. 
Unless the real plan is to keep the crowds away from the island. 
















CONEY ISLAND

If you have visited Pulau Ubin many times and are looking for something fresh, try Coney Island.
Formerly known as Pulau Serangoon, the island was owned by the creator of Haw Par Villa, Tiger Balm co-founders Aw Boon Haw and brother Aw Boon Par. 
It was then sold to an Indian businessman with plans of turning the island into a resort, similar to New York's own Coney Island. Evidently, those plans fell through.
Similar to St John's Island, nature enthusiasts will have much to write home about at Coney Island.
While St John's Island has its intertidal zones, Coney Island has a rich biodiversity featuring white sand beaches, grasslands and casuarina woodlands. 
It also houses a wide variety of fauna and flora, some of which are critically endangered. 
This island is also off the grid, with no electricity or piped water.
Visitors to the park can enter through the park connector network, of which it is a part of. 
Just make sure to adhere to the rules and leave the island before 7pm, or risk being stranded when the gates close. 
Perhaps one suggestion we would give is to make this place more accessible to people with mobility issues.
There are unsuitable terrain at some parts and we understand it's to keep the park as rustic as much as possible.
But there's so many diverse habitats that Coney Island can offer to its visitors so it'll be perfect if everyone has the chance to experience it.

"Jail, caning for man who followed woman to car park where he tried to carry her off",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-followed-woman-train-car-park-where-he-tried-carry-her-gets-jail-and-caning-3018821,"SINGAPORE: A man followed a stranger he saw on a train, alighting at her stop and following closely behind her before attempting to carry her to a corner of a car park to express his feelings.
Tran Xuan Bang, 22, was sentenced to two years' jail and three strokes of the cane on Friday (Oct 21) for one count of using criminal force to outrage the victim's modesty. Another charge was considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Tran, a cook from Vietnam, was on a train along the East West Line on the morning of Sep 16 this year when he saw the victim.
The 21-year-old woman had been drinking with her friends and was on her way home. When she alighted at Kallang MRT station, Tran also alighted, even though he was heading to Pasir Ris.
He approached the victim when she was trying to cross the road and spoke to her in Vietnamese, but she did not understand him.
Not wanting to prolong the conversation, the victim smiled and said ""hi"".
However, Tran continued to follow her, walking so closely behind that she could feel him pressing against her back.
She felt uncomfortable and quickened her pace, but Tran kept up, the prosecutor said. 
The victim told Tran to go away and extended her hand to put some distance between them, but he continued to follow her.
The victim entered a car park at about 6.40am, which was her usual route home, and Tran followed her in footage captured on police cameras.
Tran grabbed the victim's arms and waist and wanted to pull her to a corner where they could not be seen.
He planned to express his feelings and enter into a relationship with the victim.
The victim repeatedly broke free of his grasp, so Tran decided to carry her instead. He grabbed the victim's waist and thigh from behind and lifted her off the ground, carrying her four to five steps before setting her down.
The victim kept resisting, but Tran persisted. In the struggle, he inserted his hand down the victim's skirt and molested her.
He eventually cornered the victim and spread his arms to block her way. The victim knew she was not a fast runner and did not attempt to run, said the prosecution.
It was only when another woman walked past that the victim screamed for help and Tran released her. He then fled and the victim went home before going to lodge a police report with her mother.
Tran later returned to the car park to look for the victim but could not find her and went home. He was arrested later and remanded.
The victim suffered psychological harm as a result of the incident, feeling angry, shocked, helpless and violated, the court heard.
The prosecutor asked for 24 months' jail and three strokes of the cane, saying the offence was highly premeditated and was preceded by a pattern of behaviour of escalating boldness."
"Man raped woman after using fake profile on chat app to talk to her, gets jail and caning",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-raped-woman-he-met-chat-app-fake-profile-gets-jail-and-caning-li-jiajie-3018701,"SINGAPORE: A man chatted up a woman on a mobile application, using a fake name and occupation and the photo of another man as his display picture.
He then repeatedly offered her money to meet and have sex with him, even though he had only about S$22 in his bank account.
When they met up, he took the woman to his rented home where he strangled, punched and raped her.
Li Jiajie, 32, was sentenced on Friday (Oct 21) to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.
He pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated rape, with another two charges under the Films Act taken into consideration.
The court heard that Li, a China national, worked as a room attendant at a hotel in Singapore. 
In May 2018, he got to know the victim, a 28-year-old woman, on a mobile chat application. Li used a moniker instead of his real name, and the profile picture of another man that he had downloaded online.
He told the victim he was working as an engineer and repeatedly asked her to ""accompany"" him for S$2,000.
The victim understood this offer to be for sex and rejected it. She told him that she was not a prostitute.
The pair continued to chat about other things, talking almost every day. Li told her that he missed her and liked her, and that he would be good to her.
KEPT PRESSING HER TO MEET
He continued to ask her to meet him and increased his offer to S$2,500. He also told her that she might get the courage to meet him after drinking alcohol.
On Jun 8, 2018, Li asked the woman to meet him and she agreed. She asked if he would respect her decision if she changed her mind after meeting - and if he would use protection. He said yes.
On the way to their meeting, Li told her he would pay in cash; she asked for a bank transfer but he said he did not know how to make one.
In truth, he did not have the money on hand as he had no savings except for about $22 in his bank.
When they met, the victim told Li that he looked very different from his profile picture. He responded that there was no difference.
They walked to his flat, arriving after midnight. Li led the woman into a small room and closed the door.
She asked for money, but he did not respond. The woman then said she wanted to go home and booked a Grab ride, but Li refused to let her go. The Grab driver cancelled the ride when she did not show up.
REFUSED TO LET HER GO
The victim told Li she would call the police, but he threatened her in turn, saying he would tell the police she had prostituted herself.
He then forced the woman down such that her head hit the wall twice, before forcing himself on her.
The victim shouted and scratched Li, but Li strangled her neck and punched her head forcefully a few times. He then raped her.
The victim tried to talk Li into letting her go, but he raped her again. He later followed her into the shower but the victim was too dazed to react.
Li insisted on taking the lift down with her and told her that if she called the police, he would see her at the police station.
The victim booked a Grab ride, but the driver could not find her, so she flagged down a taxi. She decided to go to a police post.
Li asked her to send him her location, but she did not reply.
As the police post was closed, the victim called 999. Police officers went down to her location and she told them she had been assaulted and raped.
The victim later went to the hospital for a medical examination. The doctor found a 2cm bruise on her forehead, a 12cm by 10cm bruise on her neck and redness in her pelvic area.
Li was arrested at his workplace. An examination at the Institute of Mental Health found that he was of sound mind.
The prosecution said there was deception in this case, and pointed to how Li strangled the victim with such force so as to cause a 12cm by 10cm bruise on her neck.
The defence said Li intended to make full payment and was going to take a loan from his colleague and pay the victim the next day.
Li requested to speak to the court directly, and apologised to the victim and her family in Mandarin, saying it was a ""moment of impulse"".
""I would also like to apologise to the government officials because of the crimes I have committed. I might have caused inconvenience to their work,"" he said.
He said he hoped for a chance as he had a mother back in China who was waiting for him to go home.
""I wish I can go home early to take care of her,"" he said.
The judge told him that personal family circumstances generally do not constitute a mitigating factor."
"Shoebox condo prices in central area could rise after new rules to limit units, say analysts","New guidelines mean there will be fewer shoebox units built in central districts, which could drive up their prices on the resale market.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shoebox-condo-private-central-ura-70sqm-prices-3017876,"SINGAPORE: Prices of smaller condominium units located in Singapore's central area could appreciate more compared to larger units in the next few years, following new rules to limit such shoebox apartments, according to analysts.
From Jan 18, 2023, developers of all private, non-landed homes within central planning areas will need to set aside at least 20 per cent of dwelling units with a minimum of 70 sq m of net internal area – similar to the size of a two-bedroom unit.
Central planning areas include Newton, Orchard, River Valley, Singapore River, Outram, Museum, Rochor, Marina East, Marina South, Straits View and Downtown Core.











The move, introduced on Tuesday (Oct 18) by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), will affect all new private flats, condominiums and residential components of commercial and mixed-use developments.
FEWER SHOEBOX HOMES COULD DRIVE UP PRICES
The new ruling means that in future, there will be fewer shoebox units built in central districts, which could drive up their prices on the resale market.
“If investors want to look for something that is more bite-sized, palatable; then they have to turn to the resale market, and this will boost the demand for such small units in the central area and also their prices,” said Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at real estate agency Huttons Asia.
















This will become even more obvious when new developments are ready in a few years, as there will increasingly be a smaller pool for buyers to purchase from, he added.
""When this actually takes effect, and then we start to see it trickle down into the whole market, prices of smaller units – you may see them moving slightly faster than some of the so-called slightly bigger units,” said Mr Lee.
Conversely, an increased supply of apartments sized 70 sq m and above might ease prices of bigger homes, although analysts cautioned that ""there's always a premium cost” to staying in prime areas.    
En bloc hopefuls might also have to be more realistic in terms of asking price, as developers could now have a tighter profit margin.
NEW GUIDELINES TO ATTRACT FAMILIES
The limitations will lead to an increasing number of larger units built within central Singapore, and the URA hopes that a good mix of unit sizes will attract more families to move into the city.  
“Families don't see the point of moving to the central area when there's no suitable size units available for them,” said Ms Catherine He, director and head of research for Singapore at property consultancy Colliers.
“So this move is also in time for the handful of redevelopments taking place in the CBD (central business district) and the development of the Marina Gardens area, to position them as attractive and viable residential enclaves.”
She added that high price tags are also a deterrent as developers currently do not supply enough of bigger units to sway prices.  
While experts agree that the recent guidelines are a step in the right direction to attract larger families to the central neighbourhoods, they said that more facilities in the area could also broaden the appeal.
“This push for the central area to become a very ideal residential enclave is a bit lacking because amenities like markets and schools are in the suburban areas,” said Ms He. “There's a significant lack of such amenities in the central area.”
BUYERS WANT BIGGER HOMES
The median size of homes in the central regions has been shrinking, from 94 sq m five years ago to about 73 sq m now.
The exemption of the central area from a previous 2018 guideline led to an increase in the number of shoebox apartments, said analysts, as developers maximised profits with a higher composition of smaller units.
“The central area commands higher prices and higher land costs for developers. So as they tried to maximise the efficiency of their land plots, there has been a proliferation of shoebox sized units,” said Ms He.
There is, however, an increasing demand for bigger homes despite the average size of Singaporean households shrinking to 3.15 persons in 2021, from 3.5 a decade ago, said Ms He.
The increased appetite for more spacious living space is due to lifestyle changes amid trends like working from home.
With smart technologies such as home robots as well as the rise of creative, furniture-optimising space, 70 sq m could suffice for homes today, said Ms He.
The figure is also seen by the authorities as the minimum size to uphold a quality of living, she added.

Four CNB officers injured while arresting man suspected of taking drugs,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/four-cnb-officers-injured-man-arrest-drugs-knife-police-crime-3017936,"SINGAPORE: Four officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) were injured on Thursday (Oct 20) while arresting a 26-year-old man suspected of taking drugs.
At about 4.50am on Thursday, CNB officers conducted a raid at a residential unit along Petir Road after receiving information that a man was believed to have taken controlled drugs.
The man purportedly armed himself with a knife and put up a struggle to resist arrest and four CNB officers were injured in the process, said the Singapore Police Force, adding that the man was eventually subdued.
Three of the CNB officers were taken conscious to the hospital and received treatment for cuts, while the fourth officer suffered slight injuries.
A knife, items suspected to be controlled drugs and drug paraphernalia were seized at the scene, said the police. 
The man was arrested for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharging his duty, suspected consumption of controlled drugs, as well as possession of controlled drugs and drug paraphernalia. 
He will be charged in court on Friday with voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharging his duty. If found guilty, he can be jailed for up to seven years, and fined or caned.
CNB's investigations into the man's suspected drug-related offences are ongoing.
""The Home Team has zero tolerance towards such brazen acts of violence towards public servants who are carrying out their duties and will not hesitate to take firm action against those who blatantly disregard the law,"" the police said."
"'Buy now, pay later' code of conduct launched to protect consumers against debt accumulation","The new code of conduct aims to protect consumers against over-indebtedness amid a growing BNPL industry.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/buy-now-pay-later-code-conduct-protect-consumers-debt-3016791,"SINGAPORE: Customers will not be able to chalk up more than S$2,000 in outstanding payments with a “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) provider, unless they pass an additional credit assessment which will consider details such as income and credit information shared across all BNPL providers.
Customers will also be suspended from making further BNPL purchases once a payment is overdue.
These are part of a code of conduct announced on Thursday (Oct 20) to protect consumers in Singapore against over-indebtedness amid a growing BNPL industry.
BNPL is a payment service that allows payment for purchases over time. It differs from usual instalment plans by enabling one to split the cost for small-ticket everyday items – from a meal at a restaurant to a new dress – at zero interest, and without having to own a credit card.
The new code, developed by a working group led by the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), states that it recognises the “transformative use” of BNPL, especially for the under-served and the under-banked.
It hopes to promote best practices to ensure that BNPL offerings continue to “benefit” Singapore.
The working group was formed by SFA in March under the guidance of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Members include BNPL providers like Atome, Grab Financial Group and ShopBack.
Apart from creditworthiness safeguards, the new code lays out guidelines for BNPL providers in other areas such as ethical marketing practices and allowing consumers to voluntarily exclude themselves from such services.
Providers must also be fair and transparent when it comes to their fees. For example, BNPL firms will cap all fees, including late fees and other charges, and not charge compounding interest. Fee disclosures must be made to customers in a clear manner.
Consumers are also entitled to make full repayment at any time, without early repayment fees.
BNPL providers will also consider extending ""hardship assistance” to customers facing financial hardship, and work out a “mutually acceptable” payment arrangement. During this time, customers will not be allowed to make further transactions. 
Providers will also commit to not initiating bankruptcy proceedings against their customers.
To encourage adoption and compliance with the new code, BNPL providers will be required to undergo an audit and accreditation process by an independent expert assessor. They will then be able to display an accredited trustmark indicating that they are compliant with the code for three years, before having to be re-accredited.
An independent oversight committee will be formed to ensure enforcement of the code. This committee will have the power to request for written submission from a provider on suspected violations and remove an accredited provider from the BNPL registry, among others.
The code of conduct also mentioned the set-up of a credit information sharing bureau which is expected to be completed in late-2023, alongside the accreditation process and awarding of the trustmark to those accredited.

Pay for shoes in instalments? ‘Buy now, pay later’ shopping gaining ground in Singapore













BNPL, which started primarily as a payment method for e-commerce, has been growing in popularity in overseas markets, especially Australia, Europe and the United States.
The pandemic fuelled its growth as more took up selling and shopping online.
But the ease with which shoppers, especially younger ones, can make purchases through these schemes has stirred concerns among regulators in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.
Last month, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it plans to start regulating BNPL companies due to worries about how their fast-growing financing products are harming consumers.
In Singapore, BNPL started gaining traction in 2020 and while convenient, consumers “may be at risk of spending more than what they have budgeted for” when using such services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told CNA last year as it mulled an “appropriate regulatory approach”.
Latest figures from the authorities showed that BNPL transactions in Singapore have grown to S$440 million last year, from S$114 million in 2020.
This remains a “very small” sum compared to other means of consumer payment – less than 1 per cent of total credit and debit card payments last year – said Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in a written reply to a parliamentary question on Sep 12.
MAS’ assistant managing director in policy, payments and financial crime Loo Siew Yee described the new code of conduct as setting out “important industry-agreed standards and safeguards to mitigate the risk of debt accumulation and protect the interests of users”. 
“We will continue to monitor developments in the BNPL sector and work with the industry to address any risks to consumers,” she added.

Electric vehicle battery flat? Mobile charging vans to the rescue,"One service provider’s 10-minute charge can last about 30km, roughly the distance between Raffles Place and Changi Village.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-vehicle-battery-charging-mobile-vans-3017216,"SINGAPORE: Electric vehicle (EV) drivers can soon charge their vehicles more conveniently, with a growing industry of mobile charging vans set to ply the roads. 
All they have to do is contact firms offering the charging services and these vans – carrying portable chargers specifically made for electric vehicles – will pull up to provide juice. 
The services target drivers whose cars have run out of battery on the road, as well as those whose carparks have not been fitted with EV chargers yet.
Such efforts come amid ambitious plans to ramp up adoption of the clean energy alternative under the Singapore Green Plan, the country’s sustainability push to achieve key targets by 2030. 
Among the service providers is car dealer Wearnes, which recently started a pilot for its services.
















 ""As and when their battery runs flat, we'll respond to them by coming down with our mobile EV charger,"" said Wearnes Automotive general manager Vynn Tu. 
The firm will dispatch an electric Kangoo van retrofitted with a device from local battery maker Durapower. A 10-minute charge from the van can last about 30km, which is roughly the distance between Raffles Place and Changi Village. 
Wearnes hopes this will plug the current supply gap, while the country pursues its plan to install 60,000 charging points by 2030.
For now, services under the pilot only run on weekdays, from 9am to 6pm. The firm hopes to eventually increase its service offerings and use a different van that can provide a longer-lasting charge. 
Although electric vehicles make up just 1 per cent of the car population currently, there is no time like now, as far as Wearnes is concerned. 
""This is the best time to pilot this new mobile EV charger platform because the numbers are low. That's why it's actually manageable and it allows us to troubleshoot and make improvements to this setup,"" Ms Tu told CNA. 
ELECTRIC RIDE-SHARING SERVICES
Another firm looking to tap a growing interest in electric vehicles is EVCo. 
The firm will make available 550 electric commercial vans for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to lease next year.

Those who rent one of these vans will also have access to more than 20 mobile charging vans. 
EVCo managing director Fuji Foo said that his firm will provide charging services with the knowledge that drivers may have trouble finding one. 
""With mobile charging now, instead of having them (drivers) look around for chargers, for example, and worrying … now we are bringing charging service to them, "" he said. 
The vans will be available for lease on a quarterly or yearly basis, said Mr Foo, adding that fuel savings could make the cost of leasing an electric van cheaper than a traditional one. 
NEW LAW TO REGULATION EV CHARGING
One SME, SOS Logistics Solutions, is taking part in a pilot run by EVCo. 
The firm’s co-founder, Markus Lim, told CNA that the system could push more of its drivers to go electric. 
The delivery drivers working with his firm do not need to find a charging station at the end of a 12- to 14-hour workday, and can park their vehicles anywhere, just as they would with diesel-powered vans, he said. 
""So this way, it actually does not disrupt (the system) in terms of how the traditional leasing model is,"" he said. 
The charging services come ahead of the establishment of a new law to regulate EV charging, which will be up for debate in Parliament this year.
The legislation could see licensing and mandatory registration introduced into the sector.
Market players said they currently meet local and international safety standards, but are prepared to do what is needed to comply with the upcoming rules. 
""As and when regulations come forth, then we will have to review again… And thereafter we will see what the new requirements are and how we can comply accordingly,"" said Wearnes' Ms Tu."
More than 600 appeals for waiver of 15-month HDB resale wait-out period: Desmond Lee,"The wait-out period was one of several property cooling measures that were introduced on Sep 30.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-cooling-measures-15-month-wait-out-hdb-bto-3017046,"SINGAPORE: The Housing Board has received around 650 appeals from potential home buyers since the latest cooling measures were introduced, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said in Parliament on Thursday (Oct 20).
Mr Lee was responding to parliamentary questions from Members of Parliament on one of the new measures - a 15-month wait-out period to buy a resale Housing & Development Board flat without grants, if the buyer owns or had owned private property.
This and several other measures, including tighter maximum loan quantum limits, came into effect on Sep 30.
On the need for these measures, Mr Lee said: ""Sustained property price increases, if left unchecked, could run ahead of our economic fundamentals, and increase the risk of a destabilising correction later which will adversely impact many existing home owners.""

Singapore introduces property cooling measures, with stricter borrowing criteria and tighter limits for HDB loans













Mr Alex Yam (PAP - Marsiling-Yew Tee) asked what help may be given to those who were ""caught out by circumstances"" and require housing urgently, while Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (PAP - Ang Mo Kio) asked for the number of HDB resale flat transactions involving buyers who are or were private property owners, among other questions.
Mr Lee said that 220 of the home seekers who appealed had got an Option to Purchase (OTP) to buy an HDB resale flat before the wait-out period was put in place.
An OTP is a legal agreement between the buyer and the seller to purchase a residential property.
For these home seekers, HDB has waived the 15-month wait-out period for all of them. 
A second group of home seekers are those who have not obtained an OTP to buy an HDB resale flat, but who may have committed to sell or have recently sold their existing private property.  HDB will assess these appeals on a case-by-case basis. 
On the number of private property owners who may be affected, Mr Lee said that the number of private property owners buying HDB resale flats has doubled in 2021 and the first three quarters of 2022, as compared to 2019 and 2020.  
This group accounts for about one in 10 resale flat buyers in the past three years. 
""Proportionally, more current and former private property owners pay Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) compared to other resale flat buyers, and they also pay higher COV amounts,"" he said. 
""This is generally because many of these private property owners have more financial means to pay for their resale flats, as compared to first-time flat buyers or HDB upgraders. Some may not even need to take housing loans to complete their flat purchase.""

Commentary: Property cooling measures may cause knee-jerk reaction, but intervention was necessary













Mr Lee also reminded MPs that those aged 55 and above who are moving from private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat are exempted from the wait-out period. 
""This helps our seniors right-size their homes and improves their retirement adequacy,"" said Mr Lee.
These seniors make up about three in 10 of the private property owners who had bought HDB resale flats in the past three years, and slightly less than one in five paid COV when buying a resale flat.  
He added: ""Regardless of their age, current and former private property owners who faced extenuating circumstances, can approach HDB for assistance, and we will assess their situation on a case-by-case basis.""
He also said that the Government will consider the prevailing economic and market conditions, including the impact of the 15-month wait-out period, as it plans the half-yearly Government Land Sales supply for private housing.
The Government has increased the supply of private housing on the Confirmed List of the GLS programme by 75 per cent, from around 3,600 units in 2021 to around 6,300 units in 2022.
""We are prepared to increase the GLS supply further, if needed,"" he said. ""The Government will continue to monitor housing market conditions, and act decisively but also carefully, to ensure the stability of the wider Singapore property market, and to keep public housing inclusive, affordable, and accessible to Singaporeans.""
BTO WAITING TIME
MPs also asked the minister if the waiting time for Built-To-Order (BTO) flats can be shortened. For instance, Ms Foo Mee Har (PAP - West Coast) asked what specific measures the Government can implement to shorten the waiting time for new HDB BTO projects to less than three years.
Mr Lee said that since 2018, HDB has been offering BTO flats in some projects with shorter waiting times of around three years or less, by bringing forward the construction works for specific sites that are ready for development.
To date, close to 11,000 BTO flats with shorter waiting times have been offered, of which around 7,200 were offered between 2020 and 2022, he said. 
He added that to meet the strong housing demand, HDB has ramped up the supply of BTO flats to 23,000 flats per year this year and next year, or a 35 per cent increase from 2021. It is also prepared to launch up to 100,000 new flats from 2021 to 2025, if needed.

""Where possible, we also endeavour to launch more BTO projects with shorter waiting time, subject to site and infrastructure readiness,"" he said.
HDB is working ""very closely"" with the contractors and with their supply chain to manage construction delays, he added in reply to a supplementary question from Ms Foo.
Ms Denise Phua (PAP - Jalan Besar) also asked if HDB can consider building flats in advance instead of building them to order, in order to encourage marriage and parenthood.
Mr Lee said that he has just described a model where HDB does provide flats with a shorter waiting time, and this has been in place since 2018.
""We will work towards launching more of such shorter waiting time flats, with waiting times of three years or less, subject to site and infrastructure readiness, so that is something we are committed to do.""
He added that HDB also has Sale-of-Balance flats and Open Selection of Flats, and resale flats are available with grants.
""At this point in time, resale prices have gone up. With measures to moderate demand, we hope to manage price increases in the resale market as well to ensure affordability for first-time home buyers."""
"Man fined for abandoning cat he brought with him from Hong Kong, after it attacked other pets",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-fined-abandoning-cat-he-brought-him-hong-kong-after-it-attacked-other-pets-3017196,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$2,500 by a court on Wednesday (Oct 19) for abandoning his pet cat by leaving it at a lift lobby in Bukit Batok.
Lau Wai Hung, 43, pleaded guilty to one count of breaching his duty of care as an animal owner by permanently abandoning a British Shorthair cat named Bao Bao.
The court heard that the cat was found abandoned at the void deck of Block 624, Bukit Batok Central on Sep 6, 2021. 
It was left there with food, water and a handwritten note in English and Chinese stating the name of the cat, breed and health status. It also stated: ""Cannot continue to care due to personal issues"".
The cat was taken in by the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and found to be in good physical condition, without any welfare concerns.
Lau, who lived a few blocks away, was identified as the owner of the cat through investigations. 
In his statement, he admitted placing Bao Bao in a bag and leaving it near the lift lobby before going out for lunch.
Lau was represented by lawyer Chung Ting Fai. In his mitigation, Lau apologised and said it was his mistake, saying he did not know his act was illegal in Singapore.
Lau said that he migrated to Singapore from Hong Kong in November 2019. He bought Bao Bao in Hong Kong when the cat was two months old and lived with it for more than three years.
However, after he moved to Singapore, the cat began attacking his other cat and pet dog. The attacks started from May 2021 and went on for three months.
""So, I did the mistake and (made the) wrong decision to leave him at the lift lobby near ... my home,"" said Lau.
He said he could see the lobby from his window, and said it was to let him ""cool down"". He also indicated the cat's name to let other people know Bao Bao was not a wild cat.
""I really regret my stupid behaviour,"" said Lau.
For abandoning his cat, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$10,000, or both."
"Singapore’s household debt situation ‘healthy’, with low non-performing home loans: Alvin Tan","The proportion of non-performing mortgages among financial institution loans has remained low at 0.3 per cent.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapores-household-debt-situation-healthy-low-non-performing-mortgages-3017136,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s household debt situation is still “generally healthy” amid rising interest rates, with the proportion of non-performing home loans among financial institutions remaining low, said Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan in Parliament on Thursday (Oct 20).
“Households with outstanding mortgages will see higher borrowing costs, as market interest rates rise from the exceptionally low levels of the past decade,” said Mr Tan, who is also a board member of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
“But they will face the impact of the rise at different points of time ... and it also depends on the type of loan packages that they have taken up.”
Banks in Singapore have revised home loan rates several times this year, as global central banks go on a rate-hike race to tame soaring inflation. Experts expect borrowing rates in Singapore to go up further, with the United States Federal Reserve poised for more interest rate increases.
Mr Tan said as of the second quarter, one out of three home owners who have taken up mortgages with financial institutions are on loan packages that move in tandem with market interest rates.
These borrowers have seen higher mortgage repayments over the past months.
The remaining home owners are either on fixed-rate mortgages or have loan packages with rates that are linked to bank board rates or fixed deposit rates. The latter tracks market interest rates but “with some lag”, he said.
“On the whole, the household debt situation in Singapore remains generally healthy. The proportion of non-performing mortgages among financial institution loans is low at 0.3 per cent,” said Mr Tan.
MAS does not expect widespread foreclosures in the near to medium term, he added, noting that the number of foreclosures has been on a downtrend since 2021.
Foreclosures – the legal process by which a lender seizes and sells a property after a borrower is unable to meet their repayment obligation – has remained low at fewer than 30 units so far this year.
According to Mr Tan, this partly reflects the measures that authorities have put in place over the years to limit the amount one can borrow to buy property, including the latest property cooling measures that comprise tighter limits on housing loans and a wait-out period of 15 months for private property owners before buying HDB resale flats.
Mr Tan added that stress tests conducted by the MAS suggest that most households should still be able to service their mortgages under scenarios of further interest rate hikes and significant income losses. 
But a “relatively small portion” of highly-leveraged households may be more constrained under a stress scenario.

Likewise, the corporate sector has so far managed to weather the rise in interest rates.
Responding to a separate parliamentary question, Mr Tan said corporate revenues continue to grow, while the proportion of corporate non-performing loans fell to 2.5 per cent in June, from 3.1 per cent a year ago.
Among the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the ratio of non-performing loans also fell from 2.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent over the same period.
Loan volumes among SMEs also remained resilient over the past year, with the rate up by 11.5 per cent year-on-year in August, compared with the broader corporate loan growth of 7.2 per cent.
“The Government helps businesses access capital to help grow their businesses through various credit schemes. We will continue to monitor developments in this space,” he said.

"Pre-schools required to secure premises, be prepared to handle emergency evacuation during crises: Sun Xueling","Two Members of Parliament had raised the issue of security in pre-schools in the wake of an assailant's mass attack on children in Thailand earlier this month. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pre-schools-required-secure-premises-be-prepared-handle-emergency-evacuation-during-crises-sun-xueling-3016956,"SINGAPORE: All pre-schools are required to secure premises to prevent unauthorised people from entering, and must also have standard operating procedures to handle emergency evacuation during a crisis, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling said on Thursday (Oct 20). 
Ms Sun was responding to questions in Parliament about safety in pre-schools following an attack on scores of children in a nursery at the Thai town of Uthai Sawan earlier this month. The assailant killed 24 children and 12 adults during his rampage on Oct 6. 
MP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) and MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) asked about the security measures in place in pre-schools and whether such measures were sufficient.
In reply, Ms Sun said that the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has regulations that require pre-schools to put in place measures to protect children and staff from security threats. These regulations are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. 
All pre-schools are required to keep their premises secured. Most use electronic locks at the entrance and visitors are only allowed to enter after checks, she said. All pre-schools must also have procedures to check and record the entry and exit of all persons. 
Pre-schools are also required to have in place standard operating procedures to handle safety-related incidents, injuries, and emergency evacuation during a crisis, said Ms Sun. 
""Emergency evacuation exercises for all children and staff in pre-schools must be conducted every six months. Such exercises ensure staff and children are familiar with the processes and are able to respond quickly during a crisis like fire, terrorist attack or bomb threat,"" said Ms Sun. 
These exercises help pre-schools validate and improve on their procedures, she said. 
To ensure compliance, ECDA's licensing officers conduct regular licensing and supervisory visits. 
Ms Sun also raised SGSecure advisories, such as “Run-Hide-Tell” and “Press-Tie-Tell” as efforts to prepare against terrorism. 
Ms Sun said: ""Despite the best efforts by ECDA and our pre-schools to ensure the safety of children and staff, untoward incidents may still occur. So apart from preventive measures, pre-schools, parents, and the wider community must stay vigilant and prepared to handle such incidents should they occur."" 
In his supplementary question, Mr Giam noted that during pre-school dismissal times, it was common for a large number of caregivers to be fetching their children at the same time. 
""It is difficult for teachers to identify each and every caregiver and are likely to use their own subjective judgement to decide whether to open the door to the centre and release the child to the caregiver,"" he added. 
He asked if all pre-schools were required to have their doors unlocked only for those whose identities have been authenticated, and if these centres were required to have a list of pre-designated caregivers allowed to fetch children. He asked if ECDA would consider such a measure if necessary. 
Ms Sun said in reply that dismissal times were staggered and that teachers allowed the child to go only after looking at who the caregiver is. 
""Most schools also would take note of who the caregiver is, who picks up the child, and there are also instances where if the caregiver is not someone that the school recognises that the school actually checks in with the family,"" she added.

"Bills to repeal 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage tabled in Parliament",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/repeal-377a-constitution-amendments-protect-marriage-parliament-bill-first-reading-3016736,"SINGAPORE: Bills to repeal a law criminalising gay sex and to amend the Constitution of Singapore to protect the existing definition of marriage were both tabled in Parliament on Thursday (Oct 20) for their first readings, with debate on them expected later next month.
 
The proposed legislative changes were expected after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his National Day Rally speech on Aug 21 that Section 377A, a colonial-era law in the Penal Code that criminalises sex between men, would be repealed.
 
But in order to maintain current family and social norms, which define marriage as between a man and a woman, Mr Lee said that constitutional amendments will be made to protect the current definition of marriage.
On Thursday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam tabled the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill to repeal Section 377A, while Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli introduced the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill to amend the Constitution.
 
The amendment comes in the form of Article 156 on the Institution of Marriage, which states in part (1) that the Legislature, that is Parliament, may, by law, define, regulate, protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage. 
 
Article 156 (2) provides for the Government and public authorities to protect and promote the institution of marriage in the exercise of their functions.
The effect of these new provisions is that Parliament can define the institution of marriage and with the Government, can make policies on the basis of that definition.
 
Examples of measures include public housing policies and financial benefits for married couples, as well as education and media policies that promote and safeguard the institution of marriage.
 
Article 156(3) and 156(4) protect laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and laws and policies based on such a definition, from being invalidated under Part 4 of the Constitution (Fundamental Liberties).
 
They ensure that these laws and policies cannot be challenged in court for being in breach of fundamental liberties provided for in the Constitution.
 
However, it has been repeatedly emphasised that this will not codify or enshrine the definition of marriage as between a man and a women into the Constitution.





      Full Text of the proposed Article 156
  

156. (1) The Legislature may, by law, define, regulate, protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage.
 
(2) Subject to any written law, the Government and any public authority may, in the exercise of their executive authority, protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage.
 
(3) Nothing in Part 4 invalidates a law enacted before, on or after the date of commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Act 2022 by reason that the law
              (a) defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman; or
              (b) is based on such a definition of marriage.
(4) Nothing in Part 4 invalidates an exercise of authority before, on or after the date of commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Act 2022 by reason that the exercise is based on a definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

Mr Lee had said in his National Day Rally speech that attitudes towards homosexuality have shifted considerably, and while Singapore remains a broadly conservative society, gay people are now better accepted, especially among younger Singaporeans.
 
“Most people accept that a person’s sexual orientation and behaviour is a private and personal matter, and that sex between men should not be a criminal offence,” he said.
 
The Government had consulted stakeholders extensively before making the decision to repeal Section 377A, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in a joint statement on Thursday.
 
“From the national point of view, private sexual behaviour between consenting adults does not raise any law-and-order issues,” said the statement.
 
The other reason for the repeal is that based on a recent court decision on Section 377A, there is a significant risk that it could be struck down by the courts in a future challenge, on the grounds that it breaches Article 12 in the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law to all.
 
But the Government has affirmed that it will uphold the current family structure where marriage is between a man and a woman and the laws and policies that are based on this. It is stated in the Women’s Charter that a marriage between people who are of the same sex is void.
 
MHA and MSF said in their joint statement that many of Singapore’s policies are based on the current construct of heterosexual marriage, such as adoption, housing and education. However, this legal definition of marriage, and laws and policies based on it, can be challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds, just as Section 377A was.

Mr Lee, and other senior politicians, have said that Parliament, and not the courts, is the right place to decide on such important socio-political issues. The decision was therefore made to amend the Constitution to prevent such challenges in court.
This comes after more than a decade of controversy, protests and challenges both from those opposed to Section 377A, and those in support of the law, which was written into the books in the 1930s when Singapore was under British rule.
 
The law was last debated in Parliament in 2007 when, in a review of the Penal Code, authorities kept Section 377A, while repealing Section 377 on “carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals”. Section 377 was then replaced with a law to criminalise sex with a human corpse.
 
It was decided then that Section 377A would stay but not be actively enforced.
 
While Section 377A has not been enforced, it became a rallying point for gay rights activists and the subject of yearly protests at Pink Dot, as well as court challenges. 











If passed, the legislative changes would end one chapter of the socio-political conflict between conservatives intent on protecting family values and activists fighting for equal rights for homosexuals.    
 
After the first reading, the Bills are due for a second and third reading in the House before being voted on. 
 
The Bills will be voted on separately, with the repeal of Section 377A requiring a simple majority to pass.
The constitutional changes will need support from two-thirds of elected and non-constituency MPs to pass, which means at least 63 votes from the 92 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs. The ruling People's Action Party has 83 MPs.
While the party whip can be lifted for MPs to vote “according to their conscience” in some instances, it will not be lifted for this vote, which is “a matter of public policy”, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had said earlier."
"Man resold S$153,000 of his company's meat products after failing to be reimbursed, gets jail","On his employer's instructions, the man hired three part-time workers and paid them first, but was not immediately reimbursed for their salaries.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-resold-company-meat-products-reimburse-hire-part-time-workers-3016776,"SINGAPORE: After being released from prison for misappropriating money from his company, a man found a new job at a food and beverage firm.
He asked for part-time workers to help him cope with his workload, but was not reimbursed for their salaries immediately, so he borrowed money from a loan shark to pay them.
Tan Han Boon, 50, began pocketing more than S$153,000 in food products from the company to sell to other suppliers in order to get the cash to pay back the unlicensed moneylender.
On Thursday (Oct 20), Tan was sentenced to jail for 18 months and two weeks and banned from driving for two years. 
He pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust by a servant and one charge of driving without a licence. Two other charges were taken into consideration.
The court heard that Tan was jailed four times before for criminal breach of trust by misappropriation. His latest conviction was in 2019, when he pocketed cash in his capacity as a senior supervisor and purchaser at a restaurant.
After being released from prison, Tan found a job as an assistant manager with F&B firm Kanada-Ya SG, earning S$2,800 a month.
He was in charge of hiring and supervising part-time staff and was also entrusted with petty cash to purchase ingredients from suppliers.
In November 2019, Tan approached his boss to say he needed extra part-time staff to help with cooking. His boss asked him to employ these workers, and Tan hired three people.
They were paid at a rate of about S$8 an hour and usually worked overnight in the kitchen. When Tan tried to ask the company for reimbursement, he was not given it immediately as the company was concerned about whether the part-time staff were hired in compliance with the Ministry of Manpower's requirements.
Because Tan had already hired the staff, he had to pay their salaries out of his own pocket while waiting to be reimbursed. He said the S$2,000 that he received monthly in petty cash for ingredients was insufficient to cover his costs.
In November 2019, Tan took an illegal loan to pay for the new workers' salaries. By end-December 2019, the company still had not reimbursed Tan for his out-of-pocket expenses for the part-time staff.
The company hired a third-party vendor on Dec 31, 2019 to settle the outstanding accounts with Tan. The vendor made reimbursements to Tan on an almost-weekly basis from January 2020 to March 2020, but they were not enough to cover the interest payments that had accrued on Tan's illegal loan.
In order to repay the loan shark, Tan began misappropriating food products from the company to sell to other suppliers in July 2020.
He did so by ordering food products in the company's name and reselling them to other buyers, often at below-market rates.
Between July 2020 and October 2020, he made purchases amounting to S$153,234 in the company's name for food items like pork loin and frozen chicken parts.
He also pocketed S$1,200 in petty cash meant as payment to an egg supplier. The company discovered his offences in October 2020, lodged a police report and fired him.
Tan then found another job as a courier, but he did not have a driver's licence. He was given strict instructions not to drive the delivery vehicle and Tan hired a driver for his deliveries.
However, Tan drove the company van on Jul 7, 2021 from his home to a warehouse. He got into a collision with a taxi when the taxi switched lanes.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Tay Jia En asked for jail of at least 30 months and two weeks, with a two-year driving ban. He said this was Tan's fifth time appearing before the court for criminal breach of trust.
Tan's lawyer Asoka Markandu, who was previously a prosecutor, said 30 months was a ""high"" sentence to ask for. He asked for 24 months instead, if not less.
He said his client had been trying to turn his life around when the incident occurred and pointed to how the company had acted.
When Tan joined the company, he was the only one working in the factory at first, making the broth. When he told his employer that he needed more workers, the employer told him to find them himself and claim reimbursement, said Mr Asoka.
Tan hired three part-time workers and had to pay S$6,000 to S$8,000 per worker depending on the hours they worked. He expected to be reimbursed, said Mr Asoka. When that did not happen, he turned to an unlicensed moneylender.
The judge imposed a sentence that was lower than what the prosecutor and defence asked for."
"Bivalent vaccines for 18-49 age group to come later in 2022, as Singapore secures more supplies: Ong Ye Kung","The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine was rolled out on Oct 14. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-age-18-49-ong-ye-kung-3016741,"SINGAPORE: Singapore plans to invite people aged between 18 and 49 to take their COVID-19 bivalent vaccines later in the year as more supplies are secured, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said on Thursday (Oct 20).
Mr Ong added that the authorities hope to secure these supplies in a matter of weeks. 
He was responding to questions from MPs Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) and Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) on the timeline of the vaccines, how they compared with Moderna and Pfizer boosters in terms of efficacy and when someone who has recovered from COVID-19 should take this vaccine.
The Government had announced earlier that those who have yet to achieve minimum protection - or are aged 50 and above who last received their vaccine dose more than five months ago - can walk into any of nine Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres to receive their bivalent vaccine dose from Oct 14. 
Bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines, said Mr Ong. 
They work by simulating an immune response against two different antigens. For example, Moderna’s bivalent vaccine has been updated to protect against the Omicron BA.1 variant, in addition to the original strain.
The initial COVID-19 vaccines used in Singapore have been monovalent, which means they only contain or encode the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Singapore grants interim authorisation for first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine













The Government rolled out the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine on Oct 14, with the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty expected to be available by the end of the year. 
While Singapore is prioritising people aged 50 and above for the additional booster dose, it is planning to invite those aged between 18 and 49 later in the year. 
If an eligible person is infected, they should wait three months to take the bivalent vaccine, Mr Ong said. 
MP Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) also asked if the Health Ministry would consider reopening vaccination centres at community clubs and centres in areas with more elderly residents. 
Mr Ong said: ""Vaccination Centres and our Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres - they are chosen based on their proximity to high population density areas, good accessibility, and availability of the venue to support vaccination operations over a sustained period of time.""
Currently, there are 11 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres and Vaccination Centres, and a network of 221 participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics and 20 polyclinics, which provide sufficient convenience and access to vaccinations, said Mr Ong. 
""A BOOSTER EVERY YEAR""
In a supplementary question, Ms Pereira said that many elderly residents who have taken second boosters are not sure if they can take bivalent vaccines and when to do so. 
Noting that this was a common question, Mr Ong said: ""The answer is yes,  five months after their second booster, they are recommended to take the bivalent vaccine.
""As I explained earlier, we have moved to a new system where we stop counting the number of booster shots we are taking. We are living with the COVID-19 virus ... what we are recommending people now is that - two concepts - one, please attain your minimum protection which is three doses of mRNA.""
""Beyond that, take an additional latest vaccine five months after your last shot ... and no longer than 12 months,"" he added.
""Essentially for most people, it works out to taking a booster every year."" 
MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) then asked if people who have had multiple infections should still take their boosters. 
Mr Ong said in reply that it was best to ""ignore infections"".
""Because now that we have hybrid immunity from our vaccinations as well as infection, there are many individuals now who hardly have any response or symptoms after they are infected, so I think it's best not to count infection. Take our boosters and take our jabs diligently,"" he said."
Woodlands Checkpoint power outage: ICA to deploy more generators during maintenance periods,"A power failure at the checkpoint on Oct 9 caused delays with immigration clearance for several hours. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ica-woodlands-tuas-checkpoints-immigration-clearance-power-outage-backup-generator-3016651,"SINGAPORE: The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will be deploying additional generators as backups during future maintenance periods to avoid another power outage incident at the checkpoints, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim on Thursday (Oct 20) in Parliament. 
These generators will complement a ""secondary electrical infrastructure” that ICA had already planned to build to “further enhance power resiliency at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints” prior to the incident at Woodlands Checkpoint earlier this month which caused issues with immigration clearance for several hours. 
On Oct 8 at around 11.40pm, ICA was conducting a scheduled maintenance of the power source at Woodlands Checkpoint. The timing was chosen as it is typically an off-peak period at the checkpoint, said Associate Professor Faishal. 
As part of the maintenance, the backup power generator was activated to provide power. 
But at around 12.20am on Oct 9, the backup power generator failed, resulting in a power outage that disrupted checkpoint operations. 
Power was restored at around 4am and immigration clearance resumed at about 5.15am.

Power outage at Woodlands Checkpoint causes long queues, delays with immigration clearance













CAUSE OF THE POWER FAILURE 
The backup power generator failed due to “a fresh tear in the air duct, causing hot air from the generator to be discharged into the room instead of outside the room”, said Assoc Prof Faishal. 
“As the hot air re-circulated in the room, the generator engine overheated and shut down.” 
The condition of the air duct is inspected visually and was assessed to be in good condition on the morning of Oct 8, he added. 
Additionally, a full load test on the generator had been conducted in August.
On the morning of Oct 8, it had been ""subjected to a 30-minute test-run and was working fine"", he said. 
""While the backup generator has been in operation since 1999, its usage is low. It is only operated when the building power source is undergoing maintenance or during a power failure. It is scheduled for replacement in 2028, according to the specifications.
“As a precautionary measure, ICA will consider if the air duct should be replaced periodically in the future, even if no tears are detected.” 
During the power outage, there was no data breach or loss. The Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system had kicked in as designed and “provided sufficient time for a proper shutdown of the servers, preventing any data breach or loss”, said Assoc Prof Faishal. 
CONTINGENCY PLANS ACTIVATED
ICA has put in “additional layers of redundancy” to protect its operations from power disruptions. There are also backup generators for the main power source, said Assoc Prof Faishal. 
“In addition, UPS is provided for key systems to ensure operations continuity if the backup generators fail. These systems are regularly upgraded during planned maintenance.”
For an extended power failure which UPS cannot support, ICA has standard operating procedures in place to ensure that operations continue, Assoc Prof Faishal added. 
“This includes activating additional manpower to assist with manual clearance, communicating and advising travellers via multiple channels to avoid non-essential travel, and diverting traffic to the other land checkpoint.” 
These contingency plans were activated during this incident.
In response to Assoc Prof Faishal, Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) asked whether a red team analysis would be conducted on various vulnerabilities of key infrastructure - such as cyber, electrical supply and network cable connectivity risks. 
""We will have the AAR (after action review) to be undertaken, and in fact, the risks that were highlighted ... are things that we look at as part of our business continuity plan. And in fact, in order to do that, agencies work with the critical infrastructure stakeholders,"" said Assoc Prof Faishal.
""And we do have monthly drills that not only look at issues of power outage. We look at issues that affect our security, incidents that may go beyond power outages."""

Anyone found consuming liquor in any public place within a Liquor Control Zone during these periods can be fined up to S$1,500. Repeat offenders could face a heavier fine of S$3,000, a four-and-a-half month jail term, or both.
Retailers who supply liquor beyond the permitted trading hours may also have their liquor licences revoked.
The police also warned against setting off improvised explosive devices constructed using sparklers and discharging fireworks illegally.
They highlighted the potential fire hazards involved and the ability to cause “undue danger and alarm"" to the public. 
Those who set off improvised explosive devices could be jailed up to one year, fined up to S$5,000 or both. This could increase to a seven-year jail term, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments if the act leads to any hurt caused.

Jail for man who drove to Decathlon while under driving ban to steal kayak ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-man-who-drove-decathlon-while-under-driving-ban-steal-kayak-sport-equipment-3016636,"SINGAPORE: After he lost his job and his mother had to stop working as a Grab driver due to an accident, a man decided to steal sport items from Decathlon.
Though he was under a driving ban, 27-year-old Lee Kia Seng drove his mother's car to a Decathlon outlet, where he stole a S$700 kayak. He later sold it on Carousell.
Lee also stole other sports equipment from Decathlon outlets and tried to sell them online but was unsuccessful. 
He was sentenced on Thursday (Oct 20) to seven weeks' jail and banned from driving for two years. 
He pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and a charge each for driving without a licence and insurance. Another four charges were taken into consideration.
The court heard that Lee lost his job in early December 2021. He wanted to earn money quickly, so he decided to steal items and sell them for cash.
He decided to steal from three Decathlon outlets in Singapore as he knew the company has the largest sports store in Singapore, and he liked sports, the prosecutor said.
Between December 2021 and January 2022 he stole several items from Decathlon outlets worth S$715, including a saddle bag, a bike tool box and an 11ft paddle board.
On Jan 15 this year, Lee drove his mother's car to a Decathlon outlet at Stadium Boulevard, even though he was banned from driving.
He walked into the store and picked up an X100 three-seater blue kayak valued at S$700. He carried it like a backpack, tore off the RFID tracking tag and walked out with it.
He then placed it in the boot of the car and drove off. He later sold it on Carousell for S$500. To date, the kayak has not been recovered.
Decathlon lodged a police report that day about a kayak that was suspected to be stolen, and Lee was identified through police investigations.
When he went down to the police station for investigations, he brought all the other items he had stolen but could not sell off with him and surrendered them to the police.
The prosecutor asked for four to six weeks' jail for the kayak theft and three to four weeks' jail for the theft of the other items. She acknowledged that Lee has made late restitution to Decathlon for the kayak.
She said this was not a one-off offence as Lee looked up three different Decathlon outlets to steal from and had tried to sell the other stolen items but was unsuccessful.
Lawyer James Ow Yong said that the restitution was not at the last hour, but that an offer for restitution had been made earlier, just that the investigating officer did not respond.
He asked for a total of not more than a week's jail, a fine, and 15 months' driving ban.
DIRE FINANCIAL STRAITS: DEFENCE
He said his client's family had fallen into dire financial straits at the time as Lee lost his job. His mother who was working as a Grab driver was in an accident and could not work for a period of time, he said.
Since then, Lee has taken on two concurrent jobs as a dishwasher to make ends meet, and that was also how he saved up money to repay Decathlon for the kayak, said Mr Ow Yong.
""In essence, he is taking full responsibility for his actions. His conduct resembles that of someone having committed offences in a moment of folly, thereafter realising his mistakes and owning up for it,"" said the lawyer.
He added that Lee's modus operandi was ""simple, rudimentary and haphazard at best"". The prosecutor had said Lee targeted three Decathlon outlets, but Mr Ow Yong said he did so simply because he likes sports.
""This points to the simple thinking of the accused,"" said the lawyer. ""The items taken were of a variety in value - it's not the case that he targeted high-value items for the purpose of stealing. In his simple mindset, he was taking things he liked and tried to sell them subsequently.""
At the point of surrender, the police had detected only the theft of the kayak, but Lee brought with him all the other stolen items, said Mr Ow Yong.
In response, the prosecutor said she did not agree the offences were committed in ""a moment of folly"". She pointed to the charges taken into consideration, where some laptops were stolen.
In sentencing, the judge said driving without a licence was a serious offence adding that he recently released a set of grounds of decision for such offences."
"MOM officer took urgent leave to dishonestly use credit card he found, gets jail",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mom-officer-took-urgent-leave-dishonestly-use-credit-card-he-found-gets-jail-3016551,"SINGAPORE: After finding a credit card on a road, an officer with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) took urgent half-day leave and used the credit card to top up his EZ-Link card and buy a gold ring.
Seah Guo Rong, 36, was sentenced on Thursday (Oct 20) to eight months' jail. He pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating, with another three charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Seah was earning S$5,000 in monthly salary as an MOM officer at the time.
While walking home on Mar 16 this year, Seah came across a credit card along the side of the road in Hougang. He picked up the card and took it home.
Seah sent a message to his supervisor at MOM to request for an urgent half-day leave for the afternoon.
He then took the credit card to Hougang MRT Station, where he used the card to make a top-up of S$20 to his EZ-Link card.
He then took a train to Chinatown, where he went to a jewellery shop at People's Park Complex and told the staff he was looking for a pure gold ring. After trying on a few, he bought one for S$6,330 with the credit card.
When presented the receipt to sign on, Seah made up a signature on the spot.
He also tried to buy another gold item for about S$12,000 but the transaction was rejected by the system, so he left and disposed of the credit card and the receipt for the ring.
After this, he sold the ring for S$4,550 at Maxi-cash and deposited the money into his bank account. He traded his EZ-Link card for a new one and threw away the receipt for his sale of the ring.
With the sale proceeds, Seah bought groceries, paid bills and bought TOTO tickets.
The victim lodged a police report later that month to say his credit card was missing and that there was an unauthorised transaction of more than S$6,300 with his card.
The prosecutor asked for eight to 10 months' jail, saying the offence was committed out of greed, given that Seah had a monthly salary of S$5,000.
The offences were planned, with Seah even taking half-day leave to carry them out, he said.
Seah had also taken steps to avoid detection by disposing of the credit card, said the prosecutor.
An MOM spokesperson told CNA that Seah was no longer employed by the ministry.
""Police informed the MOM of their investigations into former MOM employee Seah Guo Rong. Pending the outcome of investigations, we had placed him under close supervision,"" the spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. 
""Seah subsequently resigned, and (was) no longer in the employment of the ministry with effect from Sep 2, 2022.""
SUCCUMBED TO TEMPTATION: DEFENCE
Defence lawyer Chia Boon Teck said his client had no previous convictions and was awarded a National Service excellence award for his contributions this year.
He gave the background of the offences, saying that Seah had committed the offence ""after years of being weighed down by mounting financial demands"" that were made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.
He ""succumbed to the temptation"" of using the credit card owing to a ""temporary lapse of judgment"", said Mr Chia.
He said Seah was unemployed from August 2018 and March 2021, depleting his savings to cope with increasing expenses especially after his son was born in December 2018.
He said he bore the weight of the family's financial burdens, with the money from the sale of the gold ring going towards his domestic expenses.
Part of the proceeds were used to buy TOTO tickets ""out of desperation for a miracle to make ends meet"", said Mr Chia.
He said his client was ""saddened"" that the prosecution said the offence was out of greed and that he was in no need of money.
""He was in dire straits,"" said Mr Chia. ""The fact that he bought TOTO tickets is evidence of desperation. Nobody commits a crime to buy TOTO tickets.""
He said his client cooperated with police, made full restitution and pleaded guilty at the first instance.
The offence was committed in March, Seah was arrested in May, said Mr Chia.
""Everything is all over for him, including his life,"" he said. He said this incident has ""totally disrupted"" Seah's life, who tried but failed to get a private-hire driver licence in preparation for the impending career change after the case came to light.
In response, the prosecutor maintained that the offences were committed out of greed.
""Notwithstanding his financial difficulties previously, at the time he committed the offences, he was earning a salary of S$5,000, which is not an insubstantial sum,"" he said.
The judge said he could not ignore the fact that attempts were made to dispose of the evidence."
Longer waiting times at hospitals with some patients told to wait up to 50 hours for a bed,"Ng Teng Fong and Sengkang hospitals were among those with wait times of more than two days, according to patients and healthcare workers. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hospitals-beds-waiting-time-50-hours-admission-ng-teng-fong-sengkang-3014596,"SINGAPORE: The waiting time for admission has surged to as high as 50 hours at some hospitals as of Wednesday (Oct 19), as public emergency departments across the country continue to see a high number of patients.
Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital were among those with waiting times of up to 50 hours, according to family members of patients and healthcare workers CNA spoke to.

This is higher than the latest data available from the Ministry of Health's website, which showed that the median waiting time for admission to wards from emergency departments was between one hour and 24.2 hours for the week of Sep 25.
Data for Oct 2 onwards has not been released yet.
CNA has contacted both hospitals for more information.

One man, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ng, said his mother had to wait 25 hours for a bed, after being brought to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital by ambulance on Tuesday afternoon because her legs started swelling.
Due to stricter safe management measures, he was not allowed to accompany his mother, who is 100 years old, inside.
“I’m very worried because I couldn't go in with her and speak to the doctor to tell them about her dietary needs and conditions,” said the 70-year-old in Mandarin, adding that his mother has advanced dementia.
According to Mr Ng, a doctor eventually called him an hour later to find out more about his mother’s condition over the past few days and said that she was currently stable.
“(At the time) they said they would only update me once she gets a bed, so I think she was put up at the A&E ward. I was worried that she might be cold there and whether anyone would give her a blanket or feed her,” he said. ""It was just a lot of waiting.""

It was a similar situation to what Ms Evelyn Lim experienced two weeks ago, when she brought her 73-year-old mother to Singapore General Hospital for suspected internal bleeding.
According to Ms Lim, it took nearly 20 hours before her mother was admitted to a ward. While waiting for an available bed, her mother was put up at the hospital’s Ambulatory Surgery Centre.
“It was very crowded and noisy there and from what I could see, there were a lot of patients with their beds pushed closely to one another and it spilled over to the main walkways as well,” said Ms Lim. 
Among hospitals tracked by the Ministry of Health, latest figures show that daily bed occupancy rates ranged from 74.7 per cent to 97.6 per cent between Sep 25 and Oct 1.

The ongoing bed crunch could also be due to an increase in patients with severe conditions, according to healthcare workers CNA spoke to.
“A lot of older people didn't go to see a GP doctor or get their medications refilled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and just let it lapse for whatever reason,” said one senior doctor who works at a public hospital.
“So the patients who are coming in are sicker and because of that, they have to stay in the hospital.”
Manpower constraints at her hospital have also been exacerbated by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, with more staff members testing positive for the virus.
“A lot of junior doctors are getting sick and because there's so many of them that are sick, there's nobody to recall. So then seniors end up having to cover them,” she said. “It’s a vicious cycle and just feels endless, so we all feel very exhausted.”
Healthcare workers interviewed for this story were not identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
A junior doctor CNA spoke to said the average waiting time at the public hospital he works at was about one day.
He said the longer wait could be due to a combination of factors, including the ongoing flu season and the spike in COVID-19 cases. But he added that even before this, hospitals have been packed.
A Ministry of Health spokesperson told CNA that emergency departments have been seeing a high number of patients for a few months. While most patients have conditions not related to COVID-19, the rising infection caseload exacerbates the situation.
“All cases presenting at the ED are triaged and priority care will continue to be given to critically ill patients at the ED,” said the spokesperson.
The ministry urged members of the public to go to the hospital emergency departments only for emergencies.
“We also appeal to everyone to play their part in alleviating the load on our public hospitals by visiting the general practitioner or polyclinic doctor first if they are experiencing mild respiratory symptoms and/or non-life-threatening conditions,” it said."
"Some migrant workers employed by Shanghai Chong Kee had to use personal savings for food, transport: MWC, BATU","A caterer has been hired to provide daily meals for about 200 workers from the company who reside at S11 Dormitory. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/migrant-workers-protest-ang-mo-kio-savings-food-transport-caterer-meals-s11-3015411,"SINGAPORE: Some migrant workers employed by Shanghai Chong Kee had to use their personal savings for food and transport expenses, a non-governmental organisation and a union said on Wednesday (Oct 19).
On Tuesday afternoon, nine men blocked the entrance and exit of a building in Ang Mo Kio, holding up signs with the company name Shanghai Chong Kee in Mandarin and demanding their salaries.
The company’s safety director said the protest was a payment dispute between his company and subcontractor Zhengda Corporation. The nine workers were from Zhengda Corporation, of whom six were engaged by Shanghai Chong Kee for renovation at the Ang Mo Kio site.
According to Zhengda Corporation, Shanghai Chong Kee did not make payment for weeks. The latter has since issued two cheques, Zhengda Corporation's project director said.
On Tuesday evening, staff from the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) visited the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol to meet the workers from Shanghai Chong Kee.
From conversations with 30 migrant workers who were employed by the company and staying at the dormitory, MWC said it learnt that many of them faced issues with their employment.
In some instances, workers were required to use their personal savings for food and transport.
“To urgently provide temporary relief until their issues are resolved, MWC immediately sourced a caterer to provide for the daily meals of the roughly 200 workers from the company who reside at S11 Dormitory,” said MWC and the Building Construction And Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU) in a joint statement.
The MWC also checked on the workers’ physical and emotional state and where necessary, offered to help them to resolve any well-being related issues.
The NGO said it would be notifying the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of the findings, and will assist the ministry in reaching a “speedy resolution” of all the outstanding employment issues faced by the migrant workers of Zhengda Corporation and Shanghai Chong Kee.
BATU will contact the management of both companies to ensure that workers’ interests are protected.
“Workers facing workplace issues need not resolve these themselves and can instead turn to BATU and MWC for assistance as we stand ready to render our help,” said the organisations.
“It is in companies’ interests to take good care of their workers. In this respect, we call on companies to reach out to MWC and BATU should they require any advice or support on managing workplace and employment related issues.
“We would also like to remind all employers to act responsibly towards their workers and comply with the regulations governing their employment, care and protection.”
On Tuesday, the police said the nine men were assisting with investigations. Officers told the men to stop their activities at the time and they complied, the police added.
MOM said it was alerted to the incident and that the workers have been assured of the help by MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management."

"More than S$430,000 raised by Singapore organisations for Pakistan flood victims","The collected funds will be channelled through the Singapore Red Cross.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pakistan-floods-430-000-raised-rlaf-singapore-red-cross-food-shelter-sanitation-3015121,"SINGAPORE: Charity organisation Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), in collaboration with the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) and mosques in Singapore, has raised more than S$430,000 to support the communities affected by the ongoing floods in Pakistan. 
The fundraising initiative was held from Aug 31 to Sep 14 to support the immediate needs of the communities affected by the floods. Aid is required in the form of food, emergency shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene items.
A total of S$432,852 was raised, the foundation said in a press release on Wednesday (Oct 19). 
The collected funds will be channelled through the Singapore Red Cross which is working with various organisations and partners to deliver aid to affected communities in Pakistan. 
Mr Muhammad Faizal, CEO of RLAF, said that this was the highest amount the foundation has raised for a humanitarian effort this year. 
“While this sum may not amount to what is required for the extensive recovery efforts in Pakistan, we hope that this will provide some relief in alleviating the immediate needs of the affected communities,” he added.  
“RLAF’s most recent fundraising efforts for the 2022 Pakistan Floods will provide tangible aid for the affected, as the communities face complex and multi-faceted challenges,” said Secretary General and CEO of SRC, Mr Benjamin William. 
More than 1,700 people have died and 33 million have been affected by floods caused by heavy monsoon rains and melting glaciers in Pakistan. 
Hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced are in dire need of support in terms of food, shelter, clean drinking water, toilets, and medicines.
Many have been sleeping in the open by the side of elevated highways.
As of September, the floods have killed 8 million animals and destroyed about 809,000 hectares of crops - 90 per cent of the country’s crops have perished.
Flooded areas have become infested with diseases including malaria, dengue fever, diarrhoea and skin problems.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 5,000km of roads and railways are severely damaged. The lack of mobility in the immediate future will challenge the delivery of aid and medical supplies to village households.
The torrential monsoon, which submerged huge swathes of Pakistan, was a one-in-a-hundred-year event likely made more intense by climate change, said scientists.

Are you a mosquito magnet? It could be the smell of your skin,"A new study found that those who produce high levels of carboxylic acids were more attractive to mosquitoes.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/are-you-mosquito-magnet-it-could-be-smell-your-skin-3015201,"SINGAPORE: Ever wondered why some people seem to attract mosquitoes while others get off without bites?
The answer might lie in the smell of your skin, according to a paper published on Tuesday (Oct 18) in the scientific journal Cell.
Every person has a unique scent profile made up of different chemical compounds and researchers found that those who produce high levels of carboxylic acids were more attractive to mosquitoes.
Carboxylic acids refer to organic acids such as amino acids and fatty acids, which are produced in human sebum - an oily and slightly waxy substance found on the skin. This is used to protect the skin, keeping it moisturised.
This was discovered through an experiment designed by the researchers, where different people’s scents were pitted against each other.
A total of 64 volunteers participated in the study and were asked to wear nylon stockings around their forearms so that researchers could collect their skin odour samples.
Over several months, researchers placed two different stockings into a closed container housing female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, to see which stocking would attract more mosquitoes.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes spread diseases such as dengue and Zika. 
A round-robin tournament revealed findings that suggest that some people are more attractive than others to mosquitoes. The biggest mosquito magnet had an attractiveness score of more than 100 times greater than that of the two least attractive subjects.
An analysis of the subjects’ scent profiles showed that the most attractive subjects tend to produce greater levels of carboxylic acids on their skin while the least attractive subjects produced much less.
The study also found that those who are attractive to mosquitoes will most likely remain attractive. This is because most viable skin bacteria reside in the pores, where they are protected from external factors, such as hygiene habits and seasonal weather changes.
Researchers said findings from the study could have important public health implications, since it is estimated that in disease-endemic areas, a small fraction of humans is more frequently targeted. These individuals serve as a reservoir of pathogens.
""Understanding what makes someone a 'mosquito magnet' will suggest ways to rationally design interventions such as skin microbiota manipulation to make people less attractive to mosquitoes,"" said the authors of the study.
'We propose that the ability to predict which individuals in a community are high attractors would allow for more effective deployment of resources to combat the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens.""

Lao Huo Tang Group was fined S$3,300 after a joint investigation by SFA and the Ministry of Health (MOH) found that the ready-to-eat food items at one of the Eng's Wanton Noodles outlets, such as char siew and choi sim, had failed the microbiological limits stipulated under the Singapore Food Regulations, said SFA.
Eng’s Wanton Noodles at 287 Tanjong Katong Road was suspended on May 18, 2021 after MOH and SFA received feedback that 68 people exhibited suspected gastroenteritis symptoms from consuming food at the premises between May 14 and May 17. The outlet was later allowed to resume operations in June that year.
The shop's food hygiene grade was adjusted from A to C starting Feb 18, to be reviewed 12 months later. The premises was also kept under surveillance.
""Food safety is a joint responsibility,"" said SFA.
""While SFA continues to be vigilant and works to ensure that the regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers should also play their part.""
Under the Environmental Public Health Act, those found guilty face a fine of up to S$2,000. In the case of a continuing offence, they will also face a further fine not exceeding S$100 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.

"Housing, rising interest rates and Woodlands Checkpoint power outage to be discussed in Parliament","Four government Bills are set to be introduced, including amendments to the Penal Code and the Constitution.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/housing-rising-interest-rates-and-woodlands-checkpoint-power-outage-be-discussed-parliament-3014981,"SINGAPORE: Housing, rising interest rates, and the Woodlands Checkpoint power outage are set to be discussed in Parliament on Thursday (Oct 20). 
According to the order paper released on Wednesday, four government Bills will be introduced, including one to make amendments to the Penal Code and another to amend the Constitution of Singapore.
The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill will also be introduced.
Members of Parliament (MPs) have raised more than 50 questions on a range of topics. Besides housing, interest rates and the power outage at the checkpoint, other questions include the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation packages and registered foreign doctors in Singapore.
HOUSING
MPs raised questions about housing, including the recently announced property cooling measures and shortening the wait time for a Build-to-Order (BTO) flat.
Last month, the Government unveiled a slew of property cooling measures aimed at moderating demand and ensuring prudent borrowing amid rising interest rates.
This includes tightening the maximum loan quantum limits and a new 15-month wait out period for private home owners buying Housing Board (HDB) resale flats.
MP Alex Yam (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) asked how many Singaporeans are estimated to be affected by the new wait-out period, and what assistance was provided to those caught out by the new measures.
MP Denise Phua (PAP-Jalan Besar) also asked if the Government will consider advance construction of more BTO projects to shorten the waiting time of first-time applicants.

Questions were also raised about the impact of rising interest rates and how they affect homeowners. MP Gan Thiam Poh (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) asked if the Government might consider assisting those affected by the rising rates.
MPs also filed questions about the power outage at Woodlands Checkpoint on Oct 9. The power outage caused issues with immigration clearance for several hours in the early hours of the morning.
The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said the outage was due to the failure of a backup generator during maintenance of the checkpoint’s main power source.
MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) asked what measures the Home Affairs Ministry have in place to ensure all border checkpoints are able to continue their essential functions in the event of an extended power outage. 
MP Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) also wanted to know the measures taken to ensure the resilience of Singapore's immigration checkpoints against power failures.
Other MPs also asked questions about the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation packages and how much of the Budget was set aside for each of them. 
The remaining government Bill to be introduced at the next sitting is the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.
According to a Facebook post by National Development Minister Desmond Lee, the amendments will lower the threshold of support needed from shop owners from the current 100 per cent consensus to 75 per cent in order for upgrading works to common areas to proceed.
This comes after a study to see how the Government can better support heartland shops."
"Revised Formula 1 circuit layout from 2023, track to no longer include Bay Grandstand","Updates will be made to the track layout due to the upcoming redevelopment of The Float @ Marina Bay into NS Square.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/marina-bay-street-circuit-f1-layout-revised-2023-tickets-ns-square-3014926,"SINGAPORE: The Marina Bay Street Circuit will look a little different next year when Formula 1 returns to Singapore. 
Updates will be made to the track layout due to the upcoming redevelopment of The Float @ Marina Bay into NS Square, the organisers of the Singapore Grand Prix said on Wednesday (Oct 19).
Works on NS Square are scheduled to start in March next year and are expected to be completed by end-2026. They were due to begin in March 2022, but were rescheduled to start a year later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The track will no longer include the Bay Grandstand while the redevelopment works are under way,"" the race organisers said.
From the next race, the revised circuit layout will be reduced to 4.928km and the number of laps increased to 63.
Turns 16 to 19 will be realigned into a 397.9m straight, bringing the circuit's number of turns to 19. 
The official lap record for the current layout of the Singapore Grand Prix is 1:41.905, held by Danish driver Kevin Magnussen.
Race organisers said that the best qualifying lap time on the new layout is 1:27.7, according to simulations based on a 2020 Formula 1 car. The minimum race time is expected to be 1:30.34.
They added that the changes are subject to the approval of world motorsport governing body Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and that more information will be released when the changes are finalised.

Man jailed for damaging 8 cars in drunken rampage after quarrel with wife,"The man damaged several vehicles at the open car park at Premier @ Kaki Bukit.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jail-damage-8-cars-drunken-rampage-quarrel-wife-premier-kaki-bukit-3014921,"SINGAPORE: After meeting some friends to drink in a gathering that breached then-prevailing COVID-19 rules, a man went into a drunken rampage over a quarrel with his wife and damaged eight cars.
Nguyen Duc Thien, 34, was sentenced on Wednesday (Oct 19) to two months' jail and fined S$2,000 for his actions that resulted in more than S$23,000 worth of damage.
He pleaded guilty to two counts of mischief and one count of flouting a COVID-19 gathering regulation, with another six charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Nguyen was a construction worker from Vietnam.
On the night of Aug 21 last year, a friend of his invited him to meet at Premier @ Kaki Bukit in No 8 Kaki Bukit Avenue 4 for drinks and a birthday gathering.
The group of seven drank and chatted until 3am. At the time, social gatherings were limited to five under prevailing COVID-19 laws.
At about 5am on Aug 22, 2021, Nguyen went to the open car park at Premier @ Kaki Bukit, which houses several car dealers.
He was intoxicated and walking unsteadily, said the prosecutor. He felt frustrated, as he was quarrelling with his wife in Vietnam.
Nguyen vented his frustration on several cars that were parked there. Some of them were new while others were parked there awaiting repairs or rental.
At about 5.15am, he began hitting a Toyota Corolla with his hands, banging on the windscreen. He attempted to lift a concrete backstop next to the car but was unable to do so.
Nguyen then picked up a metal pole and began smashing a new Honda Shuttle with it. He struck multiple vehicles until a part of the pole broke off. He also broke off a windscreen wiper on one of the vehicles.
In total, Nguyen damaged eight vehicles, with the total cost of repairs for the cars amounting to more than S$23,000.
The damage for the Honda Shuttle amounted to S$3,500, while a Volkswagen Golf GTI required S$10,100 to repair.
The Golf had been sent to Garage 13 for repairs from an accident that left it with some scratches.
It was parked at the open car park at Premier as there was insufficient parking space in Garage 13's unit.
As a result of Nguyen's actions, the vehicle sustained damage that included a shattered windscreen, a cracked tail lamp, a damaged front door, a cracked bonnet and damaged fenders.
A man called the police the next day, saying someone had smashed their new vehicles.
The prosecutor asked for four to five weeks' jail and a fine for the COVID-19 charge.
In his defence, Nguyen said he was very remorseful and regretted what he did. He said through an interpreter that he was unable to control his feelings and asked for a chance. 
The judge said Nguyen had gone on a ""senseless drunken rampage"" and made no restitution."
"Man gets jail for paying 17-year-old girl he met on Sugarbook S$1,000 for sex",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-gets-jail-paying-17-year-old-girl-he-met-sugarbook-s1000-sex-3014851,"SINGAPORE: A man who paid a 17-year-old girl S$1,000 for sex after meeting her on dating website Sugarbook was sentenced to 12 weeks' jail on Wednesday (Oct 19).
Aloi Gregory Marshall, 47, pleaded guilty to one charge of obtaining sexual services of a person under 18 years of age.
A second charge of possessing obscene films was considered in sentencing.
The court heard that the American browsed the Sugarbook website in early 2021 for companionship. According to its website, Sugarbook aims to connect ""sugar daddies"" or ""sugar mommies"" with ""sugar babes"" in a relationship where adults get ""companionship, mentorship, financial and emotional support"".
Marshall chanced upon the profile of the victim, a Vietnamese national who was then 17.
They began messaging on the website before continuing to chat on Telegram in April 2021. Marshall introduced himself and asked the victim if she was 18.
She said she was turning 18 that December. Marshall asked the victim if she was interested to meet for sex, citing payment of S$1,000 for having sex twice in two hours.
The victim agreed and they arranged to meet. On Apr 24, 2021, the victim went to meet Marshall at Delfi Orchard, where he stayed.
They had sex before cuddling and talking for half an hour. Marshall left S$1,000 as consideration for the victim's sexual services.
After this, Marshall reached out again to the victim in late April 2021, asking to meet. However, they could not find a suitable date.
He contacted her on another two occasions in May 2021, asking if she could meet or if she was free, but she did not reply.
The victim was housed at a home after being referred there by social workers. 
A case worker lodged a police report to address concerns that the victim was engaging in commercial sex.
The prosecution asked for 12 to 14 weeks' jail, saying the sentence was already revised downwards from the previous submitted term. It is now ""well within the lowest end"" for offenders who had ""made some inquiry"" as to the victim's age.
She said Marshall had proceeded even though he had found out that the victim was a minor. He also communicated with the victim thereafter to arrange for another session of commercial sex, said the prosecutor.
Defence lawyer Gino Hardial Singh said his client thought the victim ""was of age"".
""Our position is that he did not do the necessary checks and was careless,"" he said.
The prosecution said they did not accept the defence's position that Marshall had misread the victim's message where she said she was under 18.
They also disputed the defence's point that Marshall had communicated further with the victim as he liked her and wanted to see her again and know her better, and that this was not about commercial sex.
The judge granted Marshall a deferment of sentence to settle his affairs.
The penalty for obtaining for consideration the sexual services of a person under 18 is a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or both.

Longer wait times for Causeway bus travellers heading to JB amid upgrading work at Malaysia immigration,"Travellers should also expect delays over the upcoming Deepavali long weekend. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/malaysia-woodlands-causeway-bus-travellers-autogate-upgrade-longer-wait-deepavali-weekend-3014771,"SINGAPORE: Bus travellers departing Singapore for Malaysia via the Woodlands Checkpoint can expect longer wait times due to ongoing upgrading works at Bangunan Sultan Iskandar in Johor Bahru.  
“Some of the automated clearance lanes at the bus halls are undergoing replacement and installation works, and will not be operational from Oct 16 until Nov 10,” said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Wednesday (Oct 19). 
The Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Immigration Office said in a Facebook post that autogates that are not involved in the upgrading works will operate as usual for arriving Malaysian citizens. 
It did not specify how many automated clearance lanes will be available. 
Manual counters 1 to 4 will only process arriving Malaysian citizens while counter 5 has been set aside for senior citizens, those with disabilities, pregnant women as well as Malaysian permanent residents. 
The remaining counters, from 6 to 18, are for all passports, said the immigration office. 
DEEPAVALI LONG WEEKEND
ICA also cautioned travellers to expect delays over the upcoming long weekend, with the Deepavali public holiday falling on Monday. 
Travellers were advised to adjust their travel plans, where possible, to avoid being caught in traffic congestion.
""We seek travellers’ understanding and cooperation to be patient, observe traffic rules, maintain lane discipline, and cooperate with officers on-site when using the land checkpoints.""
At the peak of the Deepavali long weekend in 2019, ICA said travellers departing and arriving by car via the land checkpoints had to wait up to two hours before they were cleared through immigration. 
ICA added that traffic flow through both land checkpoints has also returned to about 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.
About 325,000 individuals travelled through both checkpoints each day over the recent weekend, said the authority, adding that the volume reached pre-COVID levels during peak periods. 
Travellers are advised to factor in additional time for immigration clearance and avoid the following peak hours:Departing Singapore
Friday (Oct 21), 3pm to 11.59pm
Saturday (Oct 22), 6am to 10am, 6pm to 11.59pm
Arriving in Singapore
Monday (Oct 24), 6pm to 11.59pm
ICA said that it will take the necessary measures to facilitate immigration clearance without compromising security, adding that checkpoint officers monitor traffic conditions in real-time to ensure optimal deployment of resources. 
""We also work with the Traffic Police to ensure road discipline at the critical junctions leading to the land checkpoints.""
ICA also advised motorists to check the traffic situation at the land checkpoints through the Land Transport Authority’s One Motoring website or via the Expressway Monitoring & Advisory System (EMAS) installed along the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) respectively.
Motorists can also get updates on the traffic situation at both land checkpoints through ICA’s Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Reimposing 'large-scale responses' unnecessary for now as Singapore rides out COVID-19 XBB wave: Experts,"Are Singapore's recovery protocols sufficient to ride out the current COVID-19 XBB variant outbreak? CNA speaks to experts.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-xbb-variant-wave-outbreak-mask-recovery-protocols-3012881,"SINGAPORE: The days of leaving the house without a mask could be over if the situation around the COVID-19 XBB variant wave worsens – but experts believe that at the moment, there is little need to implement such “blunt community restrictions"". 
“The truth is that it needs to run its course,” Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at the Division of Infectious Diseases in the National University Hospital, told CNA on Tuesday (Oct 18). 
“But as increases in cases in the future occur, we need to ride the waves and protect the vulnerable more. … It’s conceivable that we may need to retrace more in the future particularly if severe disease increases.” 
Visitor safe management measures at all hospital wards and residential care homes in Singapore have been tightened till Nov 10 as community cases rise. 
On Saturday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said infections from the XBB strain, an Omicron subvariant, will likely peak around mid-November. 
Such cases have been on the rise in Singapore over the past month, but so far, the outbreak has not prompted more severe disease than previous variants have.
Mr Ong added that the Ministry of Health (MOH) is closely monitoring the situation. It does not rule out reimposing safe management measures such as mask-wearing, but will try its ""very best"" not to disrupt normal lives, he said.

Singapore does not rule out reimposing mask mandate, closely monitoring XBB wave: Ong Ye Kung



















‘Short and sharp’: COVID-19 wave of XBB infections in Singapore likely to peak in mid-November













HOW SERIOUS IS THE CURRENT WAVE? 
There is no evidence that the current XBB wave is causing a significant increase in mortality or severe illness, said Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. 
“The main impact has been in terms of the extended MCs (medical certificates), as well as hospitalisations for individuals who have a mild illness but (have) risk factors identified during previous waves to be associated with complications,” he told CNA. 
Most patients that Dr Tambyah has seen in the last few days - including a couple of 90-year-olds - have been well, but their family members are “understandably anxious and have asked for closer monitoring”.
“While the number of cases has gone up significantly, the number of ICU cases and deaths has not risen in tandem and remains similar to the numbers at the beginning of August when there were far fewer cases overall,” he added, citing charts on MOH’s website. 
It is also important to note that most of the population has likely already been infected - as not all positive cases are reported to MOH, said Associate Professor Alex Cook and Associate Professor Shou Yiyun from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore in a joint reply. 
""First, this confers individuals who have been infected and vaccinated with 'hybrid immunity',"" they said.
""Even though reinfections are now increasingly common, and in part contributing to the surge in cases, the severity of most cases is less than those infected earlier in the pandemic, in early waves and even compared to recent Omicron waves."" 
This can be seen in ICU and COVID-19 death statistics. 
""Before the wave about a month ago, we were seeing around 10 cases a day in intensive care, when on average around 2,100 daily new infections were reported. This has grown, marginally, to 15 as of Monday when about 8,500 new infections were reported,"" said Assoc Prof Cook, who is the vice dean of research and domain leader in biostatistics and modelling for the school. 
""The country was preparing, earlier in the pandemic, intensive care beds for several hundred patients, so this is far below maximum capacity.""
Today, around two people are dying of COVID-19 daily, which is ""substantially fewer"" than during the Delta wave a year ago, said Assoc Prof Shou, the lead scientist in the health and lifestyle domain at the Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk and at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
At that time, with the seven-day rolling average, around 13 people died a day at its peak, where the number of new daily cases were less than 3,800, she added. 
The earlier two Omicron waves respectively saw around 11 deaths a day when the number of new daily cases was around 18,000, and six deaths a day where there were around 11,000 new daily cases, Assoc Prof Shou said. 
She added: ""Two deaths a day during this wave may sound like a high number, but it is comparable to the number of influenza deaths on a typical day before the pandemic.
""The smaller numbers of people in ICU or dying of COVID-19 compared to previous waves are in line with what we would expect when more of the infections have hybrid immunity from past infection and vaccination.""
WILL THERE BE YET ANOTHER WAVE? 
Assoc Profs Cook and Shou think this is unlikely. 
""Most of us have been infected, (so) the virus is running out of people to infect for the first time, which imposes a limit on the growth of the epidemic,"" they explained.
""MOH publishes a weekly growth rate in the number of cases. This shows how much the epidemic is accelerating or decelerating, much more clearly than looking at the numbers of new daily cases, which jump around from day to day.""
The two experts pointed out that the data showed the wave stopped accelerating over a week ago; it has grown since but at a slower pace.
""Extrapolating the weekly growth rate tells us to expect the peak of the wave to be upon us soon, and so the growth in severe cases should likewise crest in a week or so afterwards,"" added Assoc Profs Cook and Shou.
While more severe cases or deaths are expected, these numbers will be ""lower as compared to past waves and of a magnitude the healthcare system can absorb"", they said.
""Of the four large community waves, excluding the wave of 2020 that was mostly confined to migrant worker dormitories, this is shaping up to be the mildest, even though it is not the smallest.""

Commentary: Mask-wearing now goes beyond just protecting against COVID-19



















Commentary: Is Singapore ready for another COVID-19 wave?













WILL SINGAPORE REINSTATE MASK MANDATE? 
Whether restrictions are reinstated or removed, having trust in the authorities to make decisions guided by science is crucial, said Prof Fisher, who is also part of the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network committee.   
Removing restrictions “always comes with a proviso that these could be reversed in response to infectious disease threats”, he said. 
“It needs the public to trust that the Government and its independent experts are complying with the science, with the best of available knowledge. It’s complex following the mountains of science and data, and societies need to have faith in how that information is managed.
""Of course, the authorities need to earn that trust.”
This relationship between the authorities and the public is behind Singapore’s success to date, he added. 
Dr Tambyah highlighted that lifting the mask mandate has not affected the number of infections. 
“I sincerely hope that the Government does not reinstate the mask mandate. We know for a fact that lifting the mask mandate had no impact on case numbers,” he said. 
“Cases remained low for a month after the lifting of the mask mandate near the end of August – in other words, more than seven incubation periods. So it is highly unlikely that reinstating the mask mandate will have any impact at all on the overall number of cases or the already low rate of ICU cases.” 
Assoc Profs Cook and Shou added that since the healthcare system has weathered three large Omicron waves, with successively fewer community restrictions in place, it is ""arguable that reimposing large-scale behavioural restrictions to reduce transmission"" could be a ""retrograde step"".
This is especially so when ""most of us have already been exposed to the illness"", they said. 
Assoc Prof Cook and Assoc Prof Shou recalled the early days of the pandemic - when mask-wearing, working from home, and other large-scale national responses were necessary from the public health perspective, to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed. 
But they believe such ""large-scale collectivist responses"" would only be required again in a few scenarios, such as if a new variant emerges that is either ""intrinsically severe"" or ""against which our immunity (from past infections and vaccinations) against infection and illness is so low that a new wave would lead to many new infections and hospitalisations"".   
""The evidence of the last few weeks suggests that XBB is not such a game-changing variant,"" they said.
""Nevertheless, researchers will continue to monitor for such risks, through international collaborations, continued sequencing of the virus and epidemiological analysis of the severity of cases in our hospitals.
""We should be prepared that one day, we might need to reinstall TraceTogether and get the masks out of storage. But we should not fear every new wave.""

Home recovery under Protocol 2 will be the default for COVID-positive infants and pregnant women 



















Curbs on number of visitors, duration of visits at hospitals and residential care homes as COVID-19 cases rise













IS PROTOCOL 1-2-3 ENOUGH? 
Protocol 1-2-3 has been Singapore’s go-to strategy for living with COVID-19, since April. 
The simplified measures guide individuals on what to do if they fall into one of three categories: If they feel unwell; if they have a mild condition or feel well but test positive; and if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19. 
Protocol 1-2-3 is “easy pragmatic guidance” and “very appropriate to manage our circumstances”, said Prof Fisher. “Messaging and clear consistent guidance is critical.” 
Nonetheless, it is “always possible for the guidelines to be adjusted, particularly if the circumstance changes, to protect the more vulnerable”, he added.
On the other hand, Dr Tambyah pointed out that while these protocols are sufficient, they could perhaps be improved a little to lessen the impact of the huge number of mild cases. 
“It is good that pregnant women and infants who are well can now recover at home under Protocol 2. Protocol 3 could potentially be abandoned since almost everyone is now a contact of someone with COVID-19,” he said. 
“And perhaps the mandatory isolation period under Protocol 2 could be reduced. This is in line with the findings that individuals are most infectious from the day before the onset of symptoms to two to three days after. If the MC duration was only two to three days, then the impact of this current wave might not be so acutely felt.”  
But Dr Tambyah acknowledged that “public anxiety”, aggravated by “talk about ‘immune escape’ for this current XBB strain which even many scientists do not fully understand”, might make this suggestion difficult to implement right now. 
“The reality is that this virus is simply behaving like every other known human virus in adapting to the host and becoming more transmissible and less virulent, so it can coexist and propagate itself better,” he said. 
“Perhaps if next week’s numbers are the same or lower than this week, the protocols could be rationalised further.”

"More SkillsFuture funding, incentives will spur workers to upgrade, say experts","Subsidised salaries and tax reliefs are some ways to incentivise employers to send their workers for longer and more comprehensive courses, say observers.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/skillsfuture-funding-incentives-upgrading-workers-employers-3014691,"SINGAPORE: Making more SkillsFuture funding available will spur workers to pick the right courses that are useful for their career, rather than those that are more pocket-friendly, experts said. 
Employers also need to be incentivised to get their staff members to go for longer and more comprehensive courses, they added.
A company that sends a certain number of employees for courses, for example, could get a tax write-off and “that always gets employers motivated”, said Prof Sumit Agarwal of the National University of Singapore (NUS).  
“Another way could be that (employers) don't have to pay salaries while the employees are actually taking these courses, or they can give (these employees) subsidised or reduced salaries,"" he said.
Financing, of course, is an “obstacle”, said Prof Sumit, adding that if the Government is willing to put in more money into SkillsFuture initiatives, that would “certainly help”.
“If you are just sending people to train for a very short time and you are expecting them to be putting in their own funds, they may be reluctant or they may be choosing fields or areas which may be affordable for them, as opposed to what is optimal for them,” he noted. 
WHY DOES THE WORKFORCE NEED SKILLS TRAINING?
How much more help to be provided through the SkillsFuture Credit scheme, at major milestones of one’s life, is among the considerations Singapore needs to make to improve the country’s training ecosystem, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Oct 18).
















Speaking at the Singapore Economic Policy Forum, he said that the country will invest more in skills training, with a focus on developing more Singaporean specialists and leaders across all sectors of the economy. 
The “bottom line” is there is a need to make it possible for workers to invest their time in more meaningful and substantial training, said Mr Wong in his speech. This is especially so for mature and mid-career workers in their 40s and 50s, who are at a higher risk of career disruption, he added.
He added that another question that needs to be addressed is “how we can give employees peace of mind and time off from work to focus solely on upgrading”.
But observers noted that giving workers time off to complete longer training courses will not be easy, especially with the ongoing labour crunch.
Some experts suggested breaking courses into bite-sized programmes that can be held online, believing this is better suited for time-starved working adults. 
COURSES FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T HAVE TIME
Studies have shown that after 24 hours, a person forgets three-quarters of what has been learnt, said Mr Adrian Tan from the Singapore Human Resources Institute.

Workers must be open to training themselves, but employers must also reward workers adequately: Lawrence Wong













“Instead of learning for 12 hours straight over two days, how about 15 minutes every day? 
""Fifteen minutes, or even 10 minutes learning and a five-minute assessment. So that is then very much possible,” he said.
“If you can't even afford to provide your employees with a 15-minute downtime, then I think you probably have a larger problem on hand.”
Mr Wong said that the Government has studied many countries, but has not yet come across one with a comprehensive nationwide system of adult education and training.
Singapore is “distilling” the best practices from around the world, and examining how to apply them locally, he added. 
“Working together, I am confident we can build a better SkillsFuture system that will enable all Singaporeans to develop and grow, and bring out the best in them.”
Meanwhile, Prof Sumit believes more can be done to encourage locals to pursue higher education.
""If you look at lots of the people who are being hired at universities or at companies that are doing research and development work, a lot of them are foreigners,” he added.  
“This is where I think the Singapore government can give incentives for Singaporeans to come, spend time, and get a PhD and be part of this. That way, they are actually innovating."""
Gillman Barracks facelift to include big sustainability push,"Plans proposed by tenants include installing electric vehicle charging points and using locally sourced ingredients for food.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sustainability-green-gillman-barracks-facelift-electric-vehicles-charging-food-car-lite-clean-energy-3014696,"SINGAPORE: A new eco-friendly precinct is in the works in Singapore, as contemporary art enclave Gillman Barracks transforms itself into a lifestyle hub with a focus on sustainability.
Some of its tenants have included in their plans “car-lite” goals and clean energy initiatives, such as installing electric vehicle (EV) charging points and using locally sourced ingredients for food.
The S$2 million upgrade of Gillman Barracks, located near the Southern Ridges, was first announced in May, with tenants set to move in from the beginning of next March.
















GOING GREEN
When completed, the rejuvenated precinct will feature pet-friendly cafes and bars with live music, as well as a new playground for families, among other attractions. 
Five food and beverage players have been awarded tenders with five-year leases, including two new entrants – The Blackbird and Wheeler's Estate – which will take over blocks along Lock Road.
Wheeler's Estate, which also owns two other outlets in Seletar and Ubi, is looking to appeal to cyclists by having a pitstop and repair station at its cafe.
It is also working on a cycling route to link up all three outlets, as part of plans to encourage customers to go “car-lite”.
""We're of course going with the approach of being more sustainable, in terms of being more eco-friendly, even in the menu, (such as) trying to incorporate a more farm-to-table approach,” said business development manager Ong Bang Jun.
“This is something that we have not really done before with our other brands.”
The other three tenders were awarded to current Gillman Barracks tenants Creamier, Hopscotch and Handlebar.
Ms Jan Pek, director of Handlebar, said the biker-themed restaurant intends to play its part by incorporating EV charging and a vertical herb garden in its design. It will also feature a welcome arch at its entrance that is completely solar-powered.

“Definitely with the direction of the nation, we are looking forward that there will eventually be more and more EV motorcycles around,” said Ms Pek, who has personally observed a rise in the use of such vehicles in Singapore.
THE NEXT PHASE
Two more tenders have also been called to bring in ""more varied creative lifestyle concepts"", according to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), as it enters the second phase of its rejuvenation plans.
Due to larger floorspace and outdoor area available to some units, there are more possibilities for Gillman Barracks to reinvent itself, said SLA chief executive Colin Low.
“This includes potentially having more offerings such as artisanal craft, fitness and wellness, vertical farming, family bonding, and co-working spaces,” he said.
Plans are also underway to resume the regular heritage and art tours at Gillman Barracks by the end of the year."
Man gets jail for driving off with undercover HSA officer's hand trapped in car window,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-gets-jail-driving-undercover-hsa-officers-hand-trapped-car-window-ambush-vape-operations-cai-zhixiang-3014541,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to two weeks' jail on Wednesday (Oct 19) for driving off with an undercover Health Sciences Authority (HSA) officer's hand trapped in his car window.
 
Cai Zhixiang, 34, had been contacted by undercover HSA officers as part of ambush operations to meet with electronic vaporiser or ""vape"" sellers.
An officer posed as a buyer and struck up a deal on Telegram.
On a night in March last year, the seller told the HSA officer to approach a vehicle parked at a car park in Bukit Batok.
The victim was at the open car park near Block 274 Bukit Batok East Avenue 4, with three other HSA officers in plainclothes.
He approached Cai, who was sitting on the driver's side and the only person in the vehicle. The other HSA officers went to the other side of the car.
Cai wound down the window to speak to the victim. The officers then identified themselves as HSA officers, the prosecutor said.
While the victim was reaching his hand into the car via Cai's window, Cai pressed a button to wind up the window.
With the officer's hand trapped between the car frame and the window, Cai began to drive off. The officer was forced to run together with Cai's vehicle to avoid being dragged.
He managed to break free from the moving vehicle and did not sustain any serious injury.
Cai pleaded guilty to one count of a rash act endangering the personal safety of others.
The prosecutor asked for one to two weeks' jail, saying the victim was an officer performing his duties to apprehend the accused. Cai had driven off despite knowing the danger of doing so, she said.
Cai read out a written mitigation plea he had prepared for himself. He said it was a fact that he wound up the window when the officer's hand was in the car, trapping him.
""The reason why I wind up is because his hand reach in, and I thought he's trying to put me in harm's way,"" said Cai, adding that he ""panicked"".
""At the point of time, I had a newborn daughter aged only at three months, so it's a mitigating factor that caused me to behave (how) I did, and I'm truly remorseful for what I did,"" he said.
He claimed that he was only aware that the officers were carrying out ambush operations when the HSA officers and police raided his house after that. 
The prosecution said the HSA officers confirmed that they had identified themselves to Cai.
""I'm truly remorseful as I'm mistaken that (the victim) was someone trying to put me in harm's way,"" said Cai.
He said he cooperated fully with all investigations and went down to the HSA office for further investigations. He claimed he was not selling nor using vapes at that time.
He said he was sentenced to probation in the past for theft and served it with no breaches.
Cai has worked for the same company after completing his studies at an Institute of Technical Education, and recently furthered his studies. He is now a final-year student at a university.
""I hope that in view of my personal background, (it will show) that I'm someone who is remorseful and is able to change,"" said Cai, asking for leniency.
The judge noted that the offence was committed while Cai was trying to run away from HSA officers. He said it was entirely fortuitous that the officer did not suffer more serious injuries, owing to his ""quick thinking"" by breaking away.
He allowed Cai a deferment to Nov 1 to settle his work matters.
For a rash act endangering the personal safety of others, he could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$2,500, or both.
CNA has contacted the Attorney-General's Chambers on whether Cai faced any action over the purported vaporisers."
Serial upskirter jailed again for fifth year in a row,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gary-huang-kunjie-repeat-upskirter-jailed-again-fifth-year-row-3014491,"SINGAPORE: A serial upskirt offender was jailed for the fifth year in a row after committing the same crime some six months after being released.
Gary Huang Kunjie, 37, was sentenced to 36 weeks' jail on Wednesday (Oct 19).
He pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism, with another two charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Huang had been released from jail for a 2021 conviction, when he went back to targeting women.
Among other offences, he filmed an upskirt video of a woman on an escalator at Bugis Junction on Apr 30.
Huang was arrested after one of his victims noticed him. 
On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jaime Pang asked for 40 weeks' jail, saying that Huang was ""quite heavily traced"" for similar offences.
He was jailed for insulting a woman's modesty in 2018 and in 2019.
In 2020 he was jailed for voyeurism and insulting a woman's modesty.
Last year he was convicted again of voyeurism charges, and sentenced to jail.
Mr Pang said Huang reoffended within six months of being released from his prior sentence. The current offences are identical to the previous ones, demonstrating that his punishment has had no effect on him, said Mr Pang.
He called for deterrence, citing Huang's ""relentless intrusion"" on the privacy of women. But he recognised that there were fewer victims this time round.
Lawyer Gregory Fong, who acted for Huang under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, said he believed his client required some sort of treatment ""so that he will not be hauled back to court over and over again"".
""He has readily admitted his mistake,"" said the lawyer. ""His parents are also frustrated that their son always has to go court and to intrude on the privacy of women.""
He asked for a jail term of between 22 and 24 weeks instead.
The judge asked if Huang had taken any steps of his own accord to help himself in his situation.
Mr Fong said he believed Huang was being regularly treated at the Institute of Mental Health. According to past news reports, Huang had been previously diagnosed with conditions including fetishistic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.
However, his mental condition had no contributory link to the current offences, the court heard.
Asked how often he saw IMH's doctors, Huang said: ""Yes, they got appointment with me ... Got one time, I postpone my appointment with the doctor, so unfortunately I relapse this offence again. So this (is) my mistake for this.""
The prosecutor pointed out that IMH reports were called for in both 2020 and 2021 when Huang came to court. In 2021, a mandatory treatment order suitability report was also called for.
""This is not something not known to Mr Huang that he has this condition,"" said Mr Pang. He said Huang was given many occasions to commit to rehabilitation and treatment.
""As much as we hope that he will be rehabilitated this time, the current trend is not particularly optimistic,"" he said.
He urged the judge to issue a sentence as sought, rather than ""giving too much moderation to the accused's mental condition"".
The judge told Huang to avoid reoffending, telling him that the sentences will be ""quite high"" if he were to return.
""It is already quite high,"" she said. ""There is a need for deterrence and you need to be really very proactive about your own condition.""
For voyeurism, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments."
"Workers to rest at least 30 minutes after 6 hours on the job, before driving others in lorry rear decks","This measure to enhance worker safety will be rolled out by Jan 1, 2023. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workers-lorry-rear-30-mins-rest-6-hours-driver-safety-3014441,"SINGAPORE: Employers will soon need to provide at least 30 minutes of rest for workers who double up as drivers and have worked at least six hours onsite, before they can ferry other workers in lorry rear decks. 
Employers will also have to designate a “vehicle buddy” for all lorries with workers in rear decks. These vehicle buddies must have been briefed on their role, and should check that the driver is fit to drive and remains alert while driving. 
Set to be rolled out by Jan 1, 2023, these were among updated measures to enhance the safety of worker transportation announced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Traffic Police (TP) on Wednesday (Oct 19). 
MOM will also release an advisory on Safe Transport of Workers that will include recommendations on how employers, drivers, vehicle buddies and lorry passengers can fulfil their roles.
“There is, of course, broad recognition that the safety of workers is key, and it is necessary to have measures which are practical and effective, that can be readily and widely implemented on the ground,” said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor.
She had previously spoken about safety of worker transport during the Committee of Supply debate in March. 
RAIN COVERS FOR LORRIES
To further improve worker welfare, LTA will require all lorries used to ferry workers to be fitted with rain covers.
“These rain covers, which are typically canvas tarps, must be installed on the canopy for all non-enclosed sections of the lorry deck, including partially opened gaps, to shield workers from inclement weather,” the agencies said in a media release.
At least one side of the canopy must also be fitted with a transparent rain cover to “provide a sufficiently lit environment” for workers onboard.
To give companies time to adjust, the rain cover requirement will be implemented in three phases: 
Newly registered lorries from Jan 1, 2023
In-use light lorries (maximum laden weight not exceeding 3,500kg) from Jul 1, 2023
In-use heavy lorries (maximum laden weight exceeding 3,500kg) from Jan 1, 2024 
Responding to questions about why implementation would take time, Dr Khor said workshops would require “lead time to be able to supply and install these on all passenger bearing lorries”. 
Dr Khor also highlighted that retrofitting and installing seatbelts in the rear deck of lorries “may actually affect the structural integrity and stability of lorries”, and pose a danger to the safety of drivers and passengers. 
“Beyond structural integrity and safety actually, the dealers and workshops have also told us that (installing seatbelts in the rear decks of lorries) could also lead to potential implication on potential liability.
""For instance, you know, the warranty is void because of rectification post-installation,” she said. 
SPEED LIMITERS REQUIRED 
The Traffic Police will also require all lorries exceeding a maximum laden weight (MLW) of 3,500kg to be equipped with speed limiters. 
Speed limiters are already mandated for all goods vehicles with MLW exceeding 12,000kg, and speed warning devices are required for all goods vehicles with MLW not exceeding 3,500kg. 
“I think (TP is) also looking at the supply of speed limiters, effectiveness of the different speed limiters, as well as the number of workshops who are authorised to install the speed limiter,” said Dr Khor.
Editor's note: This story has been amended to reflect that Dr Amy Khor said it is necessary to have safety measures that can be readily implemented, not rigidly implemented, on the ground. We apologise for the error.

Bentley driver jailed 8 weeks for hurting security officer outside Red Swastika School ,"Neo Hong Chye pleaded guilty to injuring a security guard by inching the Bentley forward despite being stopped from entering the school. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bentley-car-driver-red-swastika-school-incident-neo-hong-chye-security-guard-hurt-3013131,"SINGAPORE: A 61-year-old man who inched his Bentley forward into a security officer outside Red Swastika School in January was on Wednesday (Oct 19) sentenced to eight weeks' jail and a fine of S$600.
Singaporean Neo Hong Chye was also banned from driving for 12 months.
He pleaded guilty to causing hurt through a rash act and another count of driving without insurance. The car belonged to his son's motor trade business. 
Neo had been charged alongside his son, 28-year-old Glynn Neo Jia, who is accused of altering the car's licence plate on Jan 11 and allowing his father to use the car without insurance coverage that morning.
The prosecution said the licence plate was changed for ""photoshoot purposes"" in relation to the car business, according to investigations. 
Glynn Neo has not been dealt with by the courts. 
NEO WAS DRIVING GRANDDAUGHTER TO SCHOOL
The incident on Jan 11 outside Red Swastika School was captured in videos that were widely circulated earlier this year. 
The court heard that Neo was sending his granddaughter to the school in Bedok at around 7.30am. Neo's wife was in the passenger seat, while his granddaughter was seated at the back. 
He was originally in the leftmost lane, joining a queue to enter the school through its main gate. He later switched lanes and attempted to bypass the queue of cars by turning left into the exit lane of the school. 
Before he could enter the main gate, Neo was stopped by the security guard, 62-year-old Neo Ah Whatt, who stood in front of the car. 
The guard signalled to Neo to move off to a side gate instead. 
Instead of leaving, Neo inched the car forward into the victim for eight seconds, causing the victim to move back. At this point, Neo alighted from the car to ask the victim why he could not enter the school.
The victim replied that he was not in the queue and sought assistance from the school's operations manager, who also told Neo that he was not entering the school in the right way. 
Despite this, Neo inched forward into the victim for another 15 seconds. This caused the victim to stumble back. The victim tapped on the car's bonnet twice to ask him to stop. 
Eventually, Neo was allowed to enter the school's main gate from the entry lane. 
The victim was diagnosed with a right knee bruise. He was given medical leave for three days.
















NEO'S ACT ""TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE"": JUDGE
Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Ben Mathias sought at least eight weeks' jail and a fine of between S$600 and S$800, along with a 12-month driving ban for Neo. 
Mr Tan pointed to parliamentary material which stated that security officers deserved protection under the law. ""There's no doubt that the victim here was doing his best to perform his duties,"" Mr Tan said.
In its sentencing submissions, the prosecution considered Neo's criminal history. In 2015, Neo was convicted of voluntarily causing hurt after he pulled a victim out of a vehicle and punched his face in the middle of a busy road. Neo received a four-week jail sentence for that offence.
Neo's lawyer, Mr John Lim, said that his client was ""genuinely remorseful"" and has not had a restful night since the incident outside Red Swastika School. Neo tried to apologise to the victim in person but was told to let the law take its course, said the lawyer. 
Mr Lim said his client had not intended to cut the queue and was not familiar with the route as it was his first time sending his granddaughter to school. He missed the correct gate initially and had to make a U-turn, said Mr Lim. 
He added the victim had been gesticulating wildly in the exchange. 
However, District Judge Lim Tse Haw cautioned the lawyer against pinning the blame on the victim when the security guard had been trying to do his job. 
Security officers play an important and critical role in safeguarding the security and safety of premises and its people, said the judge.
""They deserve our cooperation and respect in order for them to carry out their duties to the best of their ability,"" he added. 
""What the accused had done in this case is totally unacceptable and deserves the court's strongest disapproval. There is no place in our society for such reckless and inconsiderate behaviour.""
For committing a rash act causing hurt, Neo could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both. 
For using a vehicle without insurance, Neo could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$1,000, or both.

Four people charged with corruption over bribes for SBS Transit contracts,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/four-people-charged-corruption-over-bribes-sbs-transit-contracts-3014461,"SINGAPORE: Four people were charged with corruption on Wednesday (Oct 19) over bribes for SBS Transit contracts.
Tan Hoon Gee, 46, was charged with obtaining bribes amounting to at least S$35,655 from several people between 2020 and 2021.
These bribes were allegedly obtained by Tan, who was a senior engineer of SBS Transit at the time of the offences, as inducement or reward for advancing the business interests of the various companies with SBS Transit, said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).
Tan faces 14 charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act, of which three charges are amalgamated charges under the Criminal Procedure Code.
BRIBES
Poh Beng Chye, 59, the sole proprietor of Clear Cut Engineering at the time of the offences, and Lim Tong Keong, 58, the sole proprietor of LTK Engineering Services at the time, were also charged on Wednesday.
Both men allegedly conspired to give a total of at least S$7,600 in bribes to Tan between 2020 and 2021 as inducements for engaging Clear Cut Engineering for more fabrication and maintenance jobs, as well as supplying parts to SBS Transit. 
Poh and Lim each face three charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act, of which two charges are amalgamated charges under the Criminal Procedure Code.
Wang Hairu, a 51-year-old director of VT Global Marine Engineering at the time of the offences, was also charged on Wednesday.
She allegedly gave bribes amounting to S$14,420 to Tan as rewards for engaging VT Global to supply electrical components to SBS Transit between 2020 and 2021. 
She faces three corruption charges, of which one is an amalgamated charge under the Criminal Procedure Code.

Chin Tyng Lei, 69, director of Allinton Engineering and Trading at the time of the offences, and Wendy Loh Chen Yi, 62, assistant sales manager of Allinton, were charged on Jun 1.
They face eight charges for allegedly conspiring to give a total of at least S$13,635 in bribes to Tan between 2020 and 2021. The bribes were meant as rewards for engaging Allinton to supply hardware parts to SBS Transit.
Another senior engineer of SBS Transit at the time, Lau Yuen Fai, was also charged on Jun 1 for obtaining gratifications in the form of loans amounting to S$2,050 from Poh as inducements for engaging Clear Cut Engineering for more fabrication and maintenance jobs, as well as supplying parts to SBS Transit between 2019 and 2021.
Lau, 60, faces three corruption charges and Poh faces another three charges.
""Singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption,"" said CPIB. 
""Companies are strongly advised to put in place robust procedures in areas such as procurement and internal audit to prevent falling victim to corrupt acts by their employees.""
Anyone convicted of a corruption offence can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000, or both."
Singapore sets up ransomware task force to tackle rising threat on businesses ,"Ransomware has become a growing concern for businesses in Singapore, with the number of cases rising by 54 per cent between 2020 and 2021.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ransomware-task-force-singapore-internet-cybersecurity-practices-3014046,"SINGAPORE: The Government has set up an inter-agency counter-ransomware task force to pool representatives from different sectors and better tackle what has become a growing worry among businesses in Singapore.
The task force, set up earlier this year, will develop and make recommendations on possible policies, operational plans and capabilities to improve Singapore’s counter-ransomware efforts, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said in a media release on Wednesday (Oct 19).
It comprises senior government representatives from the technology, cybersecurity, financial regulation and law enforcement domains.
Participating entities include CSA, the Government Technology Agency, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Police Force.
""Ransomware has become a growing concern for businesses in Singapore,"" CSA said, highlighting that the number of ransomware cases in Singapore has gone up by 54 per cent between 2020 and 2021.
""Around the world, ransomware attacks have also intensified in scale and impact, becoming threats to essential services and important infrastructure.""

IN FOCUS: How ready is Singapore for a major ransomware attack?













The task force is also looking at how to coordinate Singapore’s international engagement strategy in fighting ransomware, as well as push for greater international cooperation in cybersecurity, financial supervision and cross-border law enforcement operations.
""Ransomware is also a cross-border problem. Ransomware criminals are often based overseas and leverage jurisdictional boundaries to move illicit assets and evade legal consequences,"" CSA added.
Microsoft said in a blog post on Oct 14 that a newly discovered hacking group had attacked transportation and logistics companies in Ukraine and Poland with a novel kind of ransomware.
Researchers found that the hacks closely mirrored earlier attacks by a Russian government-linked cyber team that had disrupted Ukraine government agencies, Reuters reported.
Singapore's Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean cited how a ransomware attack on Costa Rica earlier this year crippled essential services in the country, forcing the Costa Rican government to declare a state of national emergency.
""Ransomware criminals can be opportunistic and highly sophisticated,"" he said in a speech at the opening ceremony of the Singapore International Cyber Week on Wednesday.
""They take advantage of poor cybersecurity practices to gain access to their victims’ systems and data. They bet on victimised organisations being more willing to pay the ransom and hide the attack than to report the crime. They take advantage of gaps between jurisdictions to evade law enforcement.""
Mr Teo, who is also Senior Minister, said the task force will bring businesses, the Government and international partners together to counter ransomware attacks more effectively.
CSA said the task force will deliver a report recommending strategies that the Government can take to improve its counter-ransomware efforts. ""The report will be published in due course,"" CSA said.
RATING INTERNET HYGIENE OF E-COMMERCE COMPANIES
Businesses will also get an extra incentive to improve their cybersecurity practices, as the CSA plans to rate their Internet hygiene in a table published on a ""regular basis"".
""This is aimed at helping consumers make informed choices to better safeguard their digital transactions from cyber threats,"" CSA said.
CSA said it will start by rating 10 ""popular"" businesses in the e-commerce sector, a move that comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs published in May similar ratings for e-commerce platforms' anti-scam efforts.
The Internet hygiene rating is based on the average adoption of Internet security best practices, curated by CSA as common globally recognised baseline Internet standards and security controls, the agency said.
These include important Internet security protocols like HTTPS to secure website communications between parties, DNSSEC to prevent DNS spoofing, hijacking and cache poisoning, and DMARC to prevent email spoofing.
Businesses will be given a green tick, yellow tick or red cross, depending on how many Internet best practices they have implemented.

""Many enterprises, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, lack awareness and/or have low adoption of Internet security best practices to safeguard their domains, websites and email servers,"" CSA said.
""This puts customers of these companies at risk because their data and details of their transactions with the company may not be properly secured.""
Mr Teo said the ratings will allow users to do ""health checks"" on whether the websites they visit have the necessary security protocols.
""Individuals need to be aware of cyber risks, be capable of protecting themselves, and be responsible for their own safety and security online,"" he said.
CSA said it will engage businesses in other sectors like banking and finance as well as healthcare, and similarly publish their ratings.
The ratings are part of an Internet hygiene portal, a new one-stop platform with resources and self-assessment tools to help businesses adopt Internet security best practices as they digitalise.
""As Singapore builds up its digital economy and more businesses go online, cyber threats such as ransomware and phishing will remain major concerns,"" CSA said.
Mr Teo said COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies in everyday life, be it in digital payments, shopping, chatting with friends, travelling or business.
""Securing the digital domain and ensuring a trusted cyberspace will enable all of us to enjoy the fruits of the digital revolution, and its promise of economic progress and a better life,"" he said.

 Most residents in regional cities believe Singapore's death penalty deters drug traffickers: MHA survey,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/death-penalty-capital-punishment-drug-trafficking-mha-survey-3011026,"SINGAPORE: A study conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) found that the majority of residents in regional cities believed that the death penalty was effective in deterring people from trafficking drugs into Singapore.
In a press release on Wednesday (Oct 19), MHA also presented two other studies that showed strong support among Singapore citizens and permanent residents for capital punishment.
The regional study was conducted in two phases, in 2018 and 2021, and found that 87 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty made people not want to traffic substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore. 
Eighty-three per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty is more effective than life imprisonment in deterring drug traffickers. 
The study involving 7,221 respondents from six regional cities, also found that 94 per cent of regional residents perceived Singapore to be safe and 80.5 per cent of regional residents were aware of laws for serious crimes such as murder and drug trafficking. 
""These six regional cities were selected because of the significant numbers of travellers from these cities who visited Singapore in recent years,"" said MHA.
In response to CNA's queries, MHA said it would not be disclosing the names of the specific cities surveyed.
The six cities are also where most of the drug traffickers entering Singapore have come from in recent years, said MHA. The study focused on respondents aged between 20 to 39 years old who had moderate to high levels of familiarity with Singapore.
The survey also found that the perceptions of regional residents outside Singapore ""mirrored the strong agreement"" among Singapore citizens and permanent residents regarding the deterrent effects of the death penalty, said MHA.

ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE DEATH PENALTY IN SINGAPORE
An earlier study in 2020 - commissioned by MHA and done by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) - found that 79 per cent of respondents who were Singapore citizens and permanent residents believed that the death penalty deters people from trafficking substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore. 
The survey, involving 2,000 residents, found that 70 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty is more effective than life imprisonment in deterring people from trafficking drugs. 
In a separate 2021 study, conducted by MHA's Research and Statistics Division (RSD), a majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the mandatory death penalty was the appropriate punishment for trafficking a significant amount of drugs (65.6 per cent), from using firearms (71.1 per cent) and intentional murder (80.5 per cent).
This group of respondents was further asked whether the discretionary death penalty or life imprisonment would be a more appropriate punishment for serious crimes. 
A large majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that some form of the death penalty - mandatory or discretionary - was an appropriate punishment for committing intentional murder (88.2 per cent), for the use of firearms (82 per cent) and for trafficking a significant amount of drugs (73.4 per cent). 
The mandatory death penalty means that the sentencing court must impose the death penalty on the offender once he is found guilty of that crime, and has no power to impose any other type of sentence.
DEATH PENALTY FOR SERIOUS CRIMES
Both studies also showed that there was strong support in Singapore among residents for the country's use of the death penalty as punishment for the most serious crimes. 
For instance, the IPS survey showed that a large majority of respondents (74 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty is ""justified"" for the most serious of crimes, such as intentional murder, use of firearms, and trafficking a significant amount of drugs.
Similarly in the RSD survey, 73.7 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty should be used for the most serious crimes. 
The RSD survey which involved 2,000 residents, comprising both citizens and permanent residents, also showed that a large majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the death penalty in Singapore deters the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs (83.2 per cent), firearm offences (85.9 per cent), and intentional murder (85.9 per cent).
The respondents were also asked about their confidence in Singapore's criminal justice system. 
A majority of respondents (88.5 per cent) said they had confidence in the police and the Central Narcotics Bureau in ensuring that accused persons in death penalty cases were subjected to fair and rigorous investigations. 
The survey also found that 88.1 per cent of respondents had confidence in the Attorney General’s Chambers and the courts in giving the same group of accused persons fair and rigorous trials.
Less than 2 per cent of respondents indicated that they did not have confidence that Singapore’s criminal justice system would be able to do so.
The three studies were commissioned to better understand the views of local residents and the perceptions of residents in regional cities on the use of the death penalty in Singapore, said MHA. 
All three studies showed that there is very strong support among Singapore residents for the country's use of the death penalty for the most serious crimes, such as intentional murder, use of firearms and trafficking substantial amounts of drugs, added the ministry. 
""There is also a clear consensus, both domestically and within the region, that the death penalty is effective in deterring people from trafficking drugs into Singapore and is more effective than life imprisonment in doing so.""
The studies can be found on MHA's website.

Sylesnar Seah Jie Kai, 19, appeared in court via video link.
The prosecutor said the police have updated their preliminary investigations in the case, and the next stage would be for Seah to be remanded for psychiatric assessment.
He asked for three weeks for this purpose.
Defence lawyer Joyce Khoo of Quahe Woo & Palmer said she had no objections.
The judge asked Seah, who wore a red polo shirt and blue mask, if he had heard the application by the prosecution. Seah said he had.
The judge allowed the application and ordered that Seah be remanded for three weeks.
Ms Khoo thanked the police for allowing Seah to see his family the day before.
Her colleague Sunil Sudheesan had made extensive arguments at the previous hearing, to be allowed to see his client before police investigations were completed. He was rejected.
Seah was charged on Oct 12 with the murder of his father, 47-year-old Eddie Seah Wee Teck, between the fourth and fifth floor of Block 653, Yishun Avenue 4 on Oct 10.
The charge sheet did not indicate how the death of the older man was caused.
Seah's case will be heard again on Nov 9.
If convicted of murder, he could be sentenced to death."
"ERP tolls phishing scams: About S$22,000 lost in less than a week",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-spf-warn-phishing-scams-involving-erp-toll-3013531,"SINGAPORE: About S$22,000 was lost in less than a week due to phishing scams involving unpaid Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) tolls, said the police on Tuesday (Oct 18).
The Singapore Police Force said it has received at least 20 reports since Oct 13.
Victims of such phishing scams would receive text messages, purportedly from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), notifying them of unpaid bills or fines.
A URL link would be embedded in the messages and some of the messages would show that it was sent from ERP.
Victims were directed to a fraudulent website after clicking on the URL, and were asked to provide their credit or debit card details and one-time passwords (OTPs).
""Victims would subsequently discover unauthorised transactions made to their credit or debit cards,"" said the police, adding that this was a new variant of phishing scams.
The police advised members of the public to not click on URL links provided in unsolicited text messages, to always verify the authenticity of the information with the official sources or websites, and not to disclose personal or Internet banking details and OTPs to anyone.
They also advised people to report any fraudulent credit or debit card charges to their bank and to cancel their card immediately.
In response to CNA's queries, LTA said on Thursday that it does not request payment via URL links in its SMS alerts on offence notices, vehicle registration and licensing matters.
People can check their outstanding fines and their six-month history of offences, as well as vehicle registration and licensing matters, on the OneMotoring website. Fines can be paid via LTA's e-payment services, Internet banking or at AXS or SAM machines.
""We like to take this opportunity to remind the public to stay vigilant and refrain from clicking on any suspicious links requesting for immediate payment,"" said LTA.
""Any fraudulent payment which has been detected should immediately be reported to the bank or the police.""
The authority said it would notify people immediate of potential phishing scams through messages on the LTA and OneMotoring websites, and on its social media accounts.

Police investigating after 9 workers protest outside Ang Mo Kio building over unpaid wages,"The men blocked the entrance and exit of a building at Ang Mo Kio Street 62.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nine-men-public-assembly-ang-mo-kio-police-investigating-3013156,"SINGAPORE: Nine men are assisting in police investigations after they blocked the entrance and exit of a building in Ang Mo Kio on Tuesday (Oct 18) afternoon, holding up signs demanding their salaries.
The police said they received a call for assistance at 5 Ang Mo Kio Street 62 at about 1.50pm.
""Officers engaged the men to stop their activities and they complied, said the police, adding that the workers are aged between 28 and 54.
""The men are currently assisting in police investigations for the offence of participating in a public assembly without a permit.""
Images circulating on social media showed the workers holding signs with the company name Shanghai Chong Kee in Mandarin. They were also seen standing in front of a vehicle while speaking to police officers.
In response to CNA's queries, Shanghai Chong Kee's safety director Ganesan Arumugam said the protest was a payment dispute between his company and sub-contractor Zhengda Corporation. 
The nine workers were from Zhengda Corporation. Six of them were engaged by Shanghai Chong Kee from Aug 4 to Sep 27 for renovation work at the Ang Mo Kio site, said Mr Arumugam. 
The building is the headquarters of tech services firm NCS Group, which is not involved in the dispute.
According to Zhengda Corporation, Shanghai Chong Kee did not make payment for weeks. The latter has since issued two cheques, Zhengda Corporation's project director Andy Hu told CNA on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it was alerted to the incident by the police. 
""The workers have been assured of the help by MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), and have returned calmly to their dormitories,"" the ministry said on Tuesday.
The offence of taking part in a public assembly without a permit carries a fine of up to S$3,000.
""The police would like to remind the public that organising or participating in a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is illegal and constitutes an offence under the Public Order Act,"" said the Singapore Police Force."
Cladding panels removed from pillars at bus stops near Punggol MRT after complaints over design,"Commuters had complained that their view of incoming buses was blocked by the bus stop columns.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bus-stops-near-punggol-mrt-pillars-columns-view-buses-lta-3012506,"SINGAPORE: View-obstructing columns at bus stops near Punggol MRT station have been modified to be made narrower, following complaints by commuters. 
""To improve visibility of incoming buses for commuters at the bus stops near Punggol MRT, we have removed the cladding panels around a few support pillars,"" the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Tuesday (Oct 18) in response to CNA's queries. 
It added that work began in mid-October and will be completed by the end of the week. 
""We will continue to monitor feedback from commuters. Early feedback has shown that visibility of incoming buses has improved,"" said LTA.
The issue made the news last month after a commuter took to social media to complain that his view of incoming buses was blocked by the bus stop columns.
LTA explained then that the widths of the two Punggol bus stops are ""slightly narrower"" than a typical bus stop because they were converted from passenger pick-up and drop-off points.
""The bus stop columns are located at the front due to the existing drain that runs behind the bus stops,"" said LTA. ""Given the site constraints, moving the columns behind the bus stop would require the entire structure, including the drainage system, to be reconstructed.""
According to a report by 8world on Monday, the viewing angle has significantly improved after modifications to the original columns.
A commuter, identified in the report only as Miss Fang, said that while the visibility of incoming buses has improved, she hopes that authorities will further reduce the width of the columns. 
Echoing this was a commuter identified only as Mr Chen, who said that despite the modifications, he still found it difficult to see the buses from certain angles.
LTA said in September that had it worked with transport operators to remind bus drivers to slow their vehicles down when approaching the bus stops in question. 
The agency also said then that improvements would be made to the bus stops where feasible.

Man on trial for causing death of police officer by driving into her at Shenton Way crossing,"The man is accused of driving his Aston Martin into the off-duty mother-of-three while performing a discretionary right turn.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-trial-causing-police-officer-death-shenton-way-crossing-accident-driving-3012926,"SINGAPORE: A man went on trial on Tuesday (Oct 18) for causing the death of an off-duty police officer who was crossing the road with the lights in her favour at a junction in Shenton Way three years ago.
Andrew Charles Vasko, 54, is accused of causing the death of Madam Salinah Mohamed, 40, on the night of Feb 10, 2019 by driving his Aston Martin into her.
He faces one charge of causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide by failing to keep a proper lookout when making a right turn with his vehicle.
Mdm Salinah suffered fractures to her skull and was declared brain dead on Feb 14, 2019. Her cause of death was a head injury sustained during the traffic accident.
The American, who is also a Singapore permanent resident, was represented by lawyer Remy Choo Zheng Xi. Vasko accepted an agreed statement of facts prepared by the prosecution.
According to the court documents, Vasko had consumed two glasses of white wine at about 7pm that night at Sentosa. His last drink was at about 7.45pm.
At about 9.25pm on Feb 10, 2019, Vasko drove his vehicle on the extreme right lane of Maxwell Road towards Straits Boulevard.
At the signalised junction of Shenton Way, he came to a halt at the stop line on the extreme right turning lane on Maxwell Road, conforming to the red traffic light signal.
When the traffic light signal for Vasko turned green in his favour, he moved his vehicle to the middle of the junction and waited to make a discretionary right turn.
While he was turning right, the front left portion of his Aston Martin collided into Mdm Salinah, who was at the mid-point of crossing from Vasko's left to right view.
The light signal for pedestrians was a blinking green man in her favour.
The collision flung Mdm Salinah onto the road and she sustained a severe head injury. She was unconscious when taken to hospital and warded. She died four days later on Valentine's Day after being declared brain-dead.
Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam had paid tribute to Mdm Salinah after her death, calling her a ""dedicated officer"" with 21 years in service.
She left behind her husband and three young children, he said.
Vasko was driving within the speed limit at the time, court documents showed. He also passed a breathalyser test conducted on him.
No witnesses were called on Tuesday, with the court adjourning the case to November for fresh trial dates to be taken.
The court granted Vasko his application to leave the country for a few months and return in January. He had previously made similar successful applications.
If convicted of causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide by failing to keep a proper lookout when turning right, Vasko could be jailed for up to two years, fined, or both."

Relocation of otters from Seletar was 'last resort' given the presence of pups and location of burrow: Experts,"Setting up barriers to prevent the otters from accessing private estates and ponds is still a critical first measure, said experts.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/otters-seletar-relocation-last-resort-pups-holts-3012831,"SINGAPORE: The otters that were relocated from Seletar had been moved as a last resort due to the location of their burrow and the presence of pups. 
Experts who spoke to CNA on Tuesday (Oct 18) said that exclusion measures – setting up barriers that would prevent otters from accessing compounds or fish ponds – remained a priority. 
Last week, the family of six smooth-coated otters – three adults and three pups – were moved to an undisclosed area where they could access their natural food sources, the National Parks Board (NParks) said on Monday.
The authorities carried out the operation with other members of the Otter Working Group, which includes the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES), Mandai Wildlife Group, National University of Singapore (NUS), OtterCity, and OtterWatch.
This was after media reports earlier this year stated that otters had entered a private home and killed more than 50 fish in a pond.
Mr N Sivasothi, a senior lecturer at NUS' Department of Biological Sciences, told CNA that ahead of the transfer operation, NUS students and otter watchers conducted two months of research to get a better context of the situation. 
""These otters were likely to have sought refuge within Seletar Hills, after facing competition from more dominant otter families in Sungei Punggol,"" said Mr Sivasothi, who also founded OtterWatch, a group that shares news about the mammals.
""Observations revealed they were resident rather than transient, and feeding solely on pet fish in ponds of the estate which is an easily accessible prey for them. The female was observed to be pregnant and the holt they had established was a natal holt."" 
Holts are burrows in which the otters rest and sleep. 
The need to move the otters, which are listed as critically endangered in Singapore, became apparent in light of their potential conflict with humans. 
""Unfortunately the location of the natal holt was underneath a heavily used pedestrian path, bringing otters and people too close to each other,"" said Mr Sivasothi. 
""With pups, otter parents would become increasingly defensive. The busy road adjacent to the holt would be hazardous to the pups that would explore their environment when they emerged. So this forced the need for mitigation.""
ACRES, which is leading trials to exclude otters from homes in Seletar, concurred.
""The holt was in between a busy road and a busy walkway. As the pups grow older and start emerging, there would be safety issues for the animals and possible conflict issues between people and animals,"" ACRES co-chief executive officer Kalai Vanan said.
""The transfer of the otters was a last resort decision, keeping in mind the welfare of the pups."" 
He added that transfers in most cases would not be required. Had there not been pups involved in the Seletar case, prevention measures would have sufficed, the experts said, as the otters would have left in search of new food sources.

CHALLENGES, DRAWBACKS OF RELOCATION
According to NParks, in order to secure the otters, perimeter fencing was installed around the holt before they were moved. Vets were involved in the process to ensure the health and welfare of the otters. 
The process of relocation was not without its challenges and downsides. 
""Firstly, it will displace the animal, causing it stress. Secondly, the removal of the animal from the location will create a vacuum causing other animals of the said species to enter. It will be an endless cycle and that is why, co-existence and more proactive measures like exclusion are the way to go,"" Mr Kalai Vanan said.
Mr Sivasothi said that active interference required a ""significant effort of planning, manpower and materials"" and is ""fraught with difficulty"" to ensure the otters are not harmed.
While the research phase - involving observing the otter's behaviour pattern and identifying potential issues - took two months, the transfer operation took almost a week, the senior lecturer said.
This gave the otters the time to get used to the perimeter fencing and enclosure, as well as to improve on the design to minimise stress to the mammals. 
""Handling a social group of animals is more difficult compared to a solitary animal. And young pups are vulnerable and are at high risk. Also, there are few alternative sites in Singapore to relocate otters to,"" he added. 
Mr Sivasothi noted that otters would return to a site if it was attractive to them and the authorities are still working with residents on recommended exclusion measures. According to him, the Seletar holt has been filled in.

OTTER MOVEMENTS ACROSS SINGAPORE
According to numbers from the NParks, there are about 170 otters in around 17 families in Singapore. Among these, the Bishan, Marina, and Zouk groups are the most prominent, with some otters seen crossing busy roads over the years. 
Like many other species of wildlife, otters will explore their surroundings to seek resources and transient otters would pass through urban areas in their exploration. 
""There is an ongoing ecological dynamic of otter families in Singapore exploring areas, establishing territories, fending off rivals and surviving traffic and predators,"" said Mr Sivasothi.
In the case of otters venturing onto roads, an understanding of the larger area they occupy and the reasons for their movement becomes necessary, the senior lecturer added. 
""In the case of the Zouk family which got especially famous for wanderings during the circuit breaker, it is also competition in waterways which drove them to seek and find alternative feeding and resting spots,"" he said.
ACRES said it was difficult to manage the movement of otters and referred to citizen watch groups that tracked the movement patterns of otter families. 
While the authorities mentioned sterilisation as a possible measure to control the otter population in the future, this will need to be studied in detail and cannot be taken as an effective measure to resolve human-wildlife conflict, both experts said. 
When asked at what point the population of smooth-coated otters in Singapore would need to be controlled, Mr Kalai Vanan said more public awareness was needed first.
People have a part to play to co-exist with wildlife and more studies have to be conducted, he added."

Repeat offender jailed for extorting unemployed man who was sleeping outside library,"The offender told the victim that he was from ""the 21 gang"" and asked for S$2,100.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/repeat-offender-jailed-extorting-unemployed-man-sleeping-outside-library-3012736,"SINGAPORE: A repeat offender prone to violence targeted a man who was sleeping outside a library by attacking him and demanding cash from him.
Zainudin Osman, 61, was sentenced to three years' jail on Tuesday (Oct 18), with another three months' imprisonment in lieu of caning as he is over 50 and cannot be caned.
Zainudin pleaded guilty to one count of extortion by intentionally placing the victim in fear of harm in order to induce the victim to hand over money.
The court heard that the victim, a 56-year-old unemployed man, was resting on a chair underneath a shelter outside a restaurant at 600 Lorong 4, Toa Payoh at about 1am on Mar 19 last year.
Zainudin sat beside the victim and attempted to reach into the left pocket of the victim's pants, thinking he was asleep.
The victim swiped Zainudin's hand away and told him ""don't play"" in Hokkien. He then walked away to sleep on another chair to avoid Zainudin.
Zainudin followed the victim and sat beside him, even though the other seats in the area were empty. He surveyed his surroundings before reaching again into the victim's pocket.
The victim felt the touch and woke up. He asked Zainudin why he was there, and Zainudin retorted that he was free to be there.
The man told Zainudin not to disturb him and tried to disengage by walking away. However, Zainudin blocked him and told him he was from ""the 21 gang"" and asked for S$2,100.
The victim said he had no money, but Zainudin suggested that the victim hand over S$210 first and pay him the balance 10 days later.
Zainudin also threatened to beat the victim up if he ran away. At about 2.15am, Zainudin pulled the victim's hair, causing him to fall to the ground.
He struck the victim's face with his right hand, and the victim attempted to shield himself. Zainudin kicked the victim and continued to attack him intermittently in footage shown in court.
After Zainudin had pinned him to the floor with his knee and struck him with his elbow, the victim complied and handed S$210 to Zainudin, fearing further injury.
At no point did the victim retaliate. Police camera footage shown in court depicted other members of the public in the area, with one man looking on as he sat on a bench and another person on a bicycle approaching the pair.
The victim lodged a police report the next day and sought medical attention for bruising, haemorrhage and tenderness.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Phoebe Tan asked for between three and three-and-a-half years' jail, with another three months in lieu of caning.
She said there is a need for specific deterrence, as Zainudin has a string of violence-related past convictions dating from 1992.
This was an unprovoked and sustained attack against a victim who was originally sleeping, said Ms Tan.
It was also a brazen attack in a public place where a few members of the public were present, she said.
The penalty for extortion is a jail term of between two and seven years, with caning."
Man arrested in China officials impersonation scam involving staged kidnap,"There were about 70 such cases reported in September, with losses amounting to more than S$10 million, according to figures reported by the police.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/china-officials-impersonation-scam-staged-kidnap-3012641,"SINGAPORE: A 22-year-old man has been arrested for his suspected involvement in a case of China officials impersonation scam after police received a report that a 19-year-old woman had been kidnapped. The alleged kidnap turned out to be staged.
Before the report was made, the woman's parents in China received a video of their daughter with her legs and hands tied up and mouth taped shut, the police said in a news release on Tuesday (Oct 18), adding that the video was accompanied with a ransom demand from an unknown person communicating in Mandarin.
The police tracked down the woman on Friday, who turned out to be a victim of the scam.
""The victim was eventually found to be safe and sound in a flat in Woodlands, rented by the man, who was later traced and arrested,"" said the police.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the victim had received an unsolicited call from someone purporting to be a Ministry of Health (MOH) officer. The person alleged that the victim had a parcel detained at the customs which contained illegal COVID-19 medicine.
The victim was then routed to another scammer masquerading as the ""China Police"" for investigations, said the police.

""The scammer further alleged that a bank card in the victim’s name was found to be involved in money laundering activities in China, and that the banking facilities belonging to her and her family would be frozen as a result.""
According to the police, the victim was then allegedly deceived into transferring S$170,000 as “security deposit” to a bank account controlled by the scammer, so that her case can be expedited.
The victim, acting on the scammer's instructions, was also instructed to record a video of herself with her hands and legs bound to pretend she had been captured.
The victim was told that the video would be used for their investigations to lure and arrest the syndicate members, said the police.
“On Oct 13, the scammer instructed the victim to isolate herself and cease communication with others to facilitate their investigations.”
Investigations revealed that the 22-year-old man had purportedly acted on the scammer’s instructions to rent the room for the victim, and had handed over a SIM card for the victim to use for communication with the scammer.
Police investigations are ongoing.

From January to September, a total of 548 China officials impersonation scams were reported, with losses amounting to at least S$67.9 million.
Just last month, there were about 70 cases reported, with losses amounting to more than S$10 million, according to figures reported in the police news release last month and this month.
The police also highlighted that China Police, Interpol and other overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction to help with any form of investigation without approval from the Singapore Government.
They also advised members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls from unknown parties, especially those with the '+' prefix which originate overseas: 
•    Ignore such calls and the caller’s instructions. No government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms;
•    For foreigners receiving calls from people claiming to be from police in your home country, call your embassy or high commission to verify the claims of the callers;
•    Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on websites or to callers over the phone;
•    Do not make any funds transfer if the caller is of dubious identity.
•    Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act;
•    If in doubt, always hang up the call and check with the Singapore Police Force.

Singapore and Australia to look at new strategic areas of cooperation: PM Lee,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-australia-lee-hsien-loong-anthony-albanese-green-economy-agreement-3012381,"CANBERRA: Singapore and Australia will look at new strategic areas of cooperation such as supply chains and connectivity with the rest of the world, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday (Oct 18). 
The two countries also signed the Singapore-Australia Green Economy Agreement on Tuesday, Mr Lee noted, describing the agreement as the first of its kind between countries. 
He was speaking at a joint press conference in Canberra with his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese, following a meeting of the two at the seventh Australia-Singapore Annual Leaders’ Meeting.
""We've also worked on other areas to take our bilateral cooperation further, for example, in the Singapore-Australia Green Economy Agreement, which will support the transitions of our countries to net zero emissions and at the same time, boost growth and create jobs in the green sectors,” said Mr Lee.
""We hope that it will be a pathfinder for other countries similarly to cooperate with one another to deal with what’s a global problem.” 
Singapore is ready to provide assistance to support the Australian Defence Forces’ relief efforts for the floods in New South Wales and Victoria, said Mr Lee.

Australia floods crisis set to worsen amid forecast for more rain













Singapore and Australia are ""natural partners"" that share similar views on many issues, said Mr Lee. 
""And (we are) trusted and reliable partners of each other, which we have demonstrated during the pandemic,"" he added. 
“So we're looking at new strategic areas of cooperation such as strengthening the security and resilience of our supply chains, including on food and energy, and our connectivity to the rest of the world. And we will also look into facilitating the flow of critical goods between us in times of crisis.” 
The Green Economy Agreement signals “collective resolve” to confront challenges as Singapore and Australia transition their economies to net zero, said Mr Albanese. 
“It will support clean energy innovation, unlock business opportunities and create jobs, and help deliver our emissions targets while positioning Australia as a renewable energy superpower,” said the Australian Prime Minister. 
“Our commitment to work towards a food pact will shore up reliable and secure supply chains and provide certainty for Australian exporters. We also discussed the strategic outlook and our commitment to a free, open and resilient region.”
Mr Albanese was sworn in as Australia’s prime minister after the country’s new Labor government came into power in May 2022.
GREEN ECONOMY AGREEMENT
Since the Green Economy Agreement is a significant new area of cooperation, Singapore and Australia will establish a new green economy pillar under their comprehensive strategic partnership, which was established in 2015. 
The agreement will reduce barriers to cross-border trade in clean energy, as well as green trade and investment, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in a separate press release on Tuesday. 
Singapore needs to develop our renewable energy resources and import it, said Mr Lee in a separate interview with journalists later on Tuesday. 
“Australia has a lot of renewable energy resources. Singapore needs to develop ours and to import renewable energy, one form or another, so there is a complementarity which is valuable to both of us and we are working together,” he added
Under the agreement, Singapore and Australia have agreed on an early list of 17 joint initiatives, Mr Lee noted. 
For example, Singapore and Australia will work together to support small-to-medium enterprises in their efforts to jointly develop innovative green products, services and technologies through grants and business matching services, said MTI and MSE in the press release.
To explore cross-border electricity trade, the two countries will also establish a joint working group to develop the architecture for this trade, and enhance regional energy connectivity. 
Australia and Singapore will also collaborate on ideas that promote best practices for sustainable agri-food systems. The aim is to reduce global food security concerns, limit the effects of climate change, and reduce the impact of agri-food systems on the environment, the press release read. 
Responding to a question about a data breach at Singtel-owned Optus, Mr Lee stressed that all Singapore companies are expected to comply fully with domestic laws wherever they operate, and cooperate with domestic regulators to protect consumers’ interests. 
The breach was one of Australia's biggest, in which the data of up to 10 million customers - including home addresses, driver's licenses and passport numbers - was compromised.
“In the case of Optus, this is an Australian company is incorporated and headquartered in Australia. Its operations are run out of Australia and not from Singapore and therefore Australia's rules and regulations apply in addressing this incident,” said Mr Lee. 
Singtel is taking the incident seriously and will fully support Optus in meeting Australia's rules and requirements in handling the incident, he added. 
“Our cybersecurity and infocomm agencies have also reached out to their Australian counterparts. We stand ready to provide support to the Australian government, should our assistance be needed.” 
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, bilateral cooperation between Singapore and Australia has continued, said Mr Lee during the joint press conference. 
Singaporeans were the fourth-largest group of short-term visitors to Australia in the first half of this year, he added. 
Mr Albanese thanked Singapore for the role it played during the pandemic. 
“It might not be known by all Australians, but essentially without Singapore and its support by air and by sea, the vaccine - to enter this country - wouldn't have been possible. Along with PPE, along with ventilators, Singapore played such a critical role.” 
Mr Lee welcomed Mr Albanese's efforts to deepen Australia's engagement with Southeast Asia. 
""We are very happy that the relations between our two countries have remained strong,"" he added. ""It’s a troubled world. Given the tensions in the world, it is important that like-minded partners work together for our mutual benefit.""
Responding to a question about how Singapore and Australia are maintaining security and cooperation in supply chains amid increasing geopolitical instability, Mr Lee.
“Countries are going for resilience. But it's not possible for us to go for self-sufficiency. We’re too interdependent,” he added. 
“You will do business with everybody, but with countries where you have a deep established relationship of trust and confidence, you can do even more. And in the case of Singapore and Australia, we do have that reservoir of trust and confidence and history. And we are working to deepen this.”

Singapore, Australia reaffirm close and long-standing defence ties"
"Singapore will ‘redouble’ efforts to develop, support local workers: Lawrence Wong",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-economy-workers-jobs-skills-training-lawrence-wong-3012601,"SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong assured Singaporeans that the Government will “redouble” its efforts to develop and support workers while keeping the economy open.
Speaking at the Singapore Economic Policy Forum on Tuesday (Oct 18), Mr Wong spoke about Singapore’s strategy to keep the economy growing and ensure that growth is inclusive, in a more uncertain global economic environment.
Singapore’s “twin strategy” is to stay open and develop local, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
“Our first imperative is to stay open and connected to the world - this is not just essential, but it is existential, for Singapore, because we are a little red dot with no natural resources and no hinterland,” he said.
Mr Wong noted that in recent years, there has been “very ugly” anti-foreigner sentiment surfacing in some quarters, with some arguing that Singapore wants to stay open “in principle”, but should “get rid of more foreigners” to reclaim jobs for Singaporeans.
But that thinking is “fatally flawed” as those jobs will not automatically go to Singaporeans, he said.
“On the contrary, if our policies become overly restrictive, global companies based here will simply find other places to operate in - places with larger markets or larger pools of expertise,” he said.
“We will lose all the jobs that the companies brought here, and these include many good jobs being done by Singaporeans. If this perception of Singapore sets in, decades of hard work to build our hub will be wasted.”
He added: “Our economy will contract … and go down in a tailspin. We will end up with far worse problems, and ultimately it’s Singaporeans who will pay the price.”
For Singapore to continue to thrive, it must continue to attract the best companies and top talent to Singapore, while developing its people, Mr Wong emphasised.
“This is why we have always been very deliberate in bringing in new investments to Singapore – making sure that these investments help to strengthen our capabilities and our people.”
He gave the example of German engineering and manufacturing firm Bosch Rexroth, which has a regional training centre in the Jurong Innovation District to train technicians and engineers in advanced manufacturing. 
It also offers industry knowledge and business networks to support other firms, especially SMEs, all of which create “positive spill-over effects” for the Singapore economy and better jobs for Singaporeans, said Mr Wong.

Workers must be open to training themselves, but employers must also reward workers adequately: Lawrence Wong



















'Not zero-sum game': Careful balance needed for foreign manpower policies, says Tan See Leng













BETTER SKILLSFUTURE SYSTEM
At the same time, he promised that investing in the skills and human capital of Singaporeans has been and will continue to be a key priority for the Government, listing several ways that workers here will be supported.
Singapore will continually update its manpower policies and rules to manage the flow of work-pass holders, and to ensure that they are of the right calibre, Mr Wong said.
It will also make sure that employers adopt fair employment practices, and take a strong stance against discrimination in the workplace.
The country will invest more in skills training, with a focus on developing more Singaporean specialists and leaders across all sectors of the economy, he said.
“Our aim is to invest significantly in all Singaporeans and help them to build up the skills and capabilities they need to succeed throughout their working lives,” said Mr Wong.
A majority of workers will need more extensive training to stay relevant or to pivot into new sectors, especially when industries are undergoing dramatic change and transformation, he added.
The “bottom line” is there is a need to make it possible for workers to invest their time in more meaningful and substantial training, said Mr Wong, especially for mature and mid-career workers in their 40s and 50s who are more at risk of career disruption.
This will require a “fundamental upgrading” of Singapore’s training ecosystem, he added.
“There are some things that we will have to consider, for example, how much more should we provide through the SkillsFuture credit at major milestones of one’s life for upgrading … how we can give employees peace of mind and time off from work to focus solely on upgrading,” he said. 
Mr Wong said that the Government has studied many countries but no one has a comprehensive nationwide system of adult education and training.
Singapore is “distilling” the best practices from around the world, and studying how to apply them in the local context, he added.
“Working together, I am confident we can build a better SkillsFuture system that will enable all Singaporeans to develop and grow, and bring out the best in them,” he said.
“All of this put together will be a key part of our refreshed compact with all Singaporeans –  that we will stay open as a vibrant hub for the world; at the same time, Singaporeans can be assured that they will never walk alone as they journey through their careers.”

“HANDS-ON” AND “HEART” WORK
Mr Wong also promised to strengthen “multiple pathways of progression” to help people with different strengths and talents flourish.
“Our school system is becoming more diverse and flexible,” he said. 
""We have been taking steps over the years to blunt the effects of streaming and allow for more fluidity in our system.”
Streaming will be phased out completely by 2024, to be replaced by full subject-based banding, which lets secondary school students pursue subjects at different levels, based on their interests and aptitude.
Beyond that, broader change is required in the economy, which still places too much of a premium on cognitive abilities or “head” work, he said.
And there is not sufficient value placed on other forms of work, such as technical roles which tend to be more “hands-on” work, or service and community care roles which tend to be more “heart” work.
This can be seen in the growing divergence between the starting pay for ITE, polytechnic and university graduates, said Mr Wong.
To tackle this, Singapore has tightened foreign worker quotas and increased their salary thresholds over the last decade, while raising the wages of lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model.
The Government is also investing more to raise the quality of vocational instruction in Institutes of Higher Learning. 
“Beyond these moves, we must do more to recognise the value of ‘hands’ or ‘heart’ work across the economy,” he said. 
There is a need to look at ways to re-design jobs and raise productivity in such sectors; upgrade skills, and establish better career progression for workers, and for businesses to pay their workers well. 
“All of us as Singaporeans must do our part too, and be willing to pay more, and bear the higher cost of goods and services delivered by our fellow workers in these different sectors and occupations,” he said.
“For many people, wages are just one part of this debate - respect and dignity matter equally, if not more.”
Mr Wong urged Singaporeans to “move away from preconceptions that academic success should be prized above all others”.
“Instead, we must respect those who labour with their hands and hearts, and confer upon them the same status as other paths. We must also give them opportunities to advance in their respective fields, and not pigeonhole them into specific tasks, or hold them back unfairly.”
This will require a fundamental mindset shift in society – by employers, and by society, he said.
“Some of these shifts will not be easy to attain. But if we work together, I am confident that we can expand the possibilities for fulfilment and success for every generation of Singaporeans,” said Mr Wong.
“This is the great task of nation-building that falls upon our shoulders. And this is the Singapore that I hope to see in my lifetime.”"
Man admits starting fire at groom's home on ex-girlfriend's wedding day,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-started-fire-grooms-home-ex-girlfriend-wedding-day-surenthiran-sugumaran-3012576,"SINGAPORE: After hearing that his ex-girlfriend was getting married, a man went to the groom's home in the early hours of their wedding day in order to start a fire.
Surenthiran Sugumaran, 30, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Oct 18) to one count of mischief by fire, with a second charge of wrongful confinement taken into consideration for sentencing.
The court heard that Surenthiran discovered through an Instagram post that his ex-girlfriend was getting married the next day.
Out of anger and jealousy, he planned to lock the main gate of his ex-girlfriend's husband-to-be and set a fire to cause inconvenience to the groom ahead of the wedding ceremony.
Surenthiran filled an empty bottle with petrol and headed to the victim's home in Jurong West in the wee hours of Mar 12, 2022, dressed in a black hoodie and long pants. 
After parking his motorcycle, he drew the hood over his face to avoid being caught on closed-circuit television cameras that were around the lift lobby.
He took the lift to the 12th floor before walking up the stairs to the 13th storey, to avoid detection by police cameras.
At about 4.40am, Surenthiran locked the victim's main gate with a bicycle lock, before pouring petrol onto a shoe rack outside the unit and setting it on fire.
He then walked down the stairs, took the lift to the ground floor and threw the lighter in the bushes before riding home.
Six pairs of shoes and one pair of slippers were damaged in the fire, with total losses to the victim estimated at about S$410.
The prosecutor sought six to nine months' jail for Surenthiran, citing the serious danger posed by the offence of mischief by fire.
He said this stems from the ""uncontrollable nature of fire"", highlighting that Surenthiran had used an accelerant in the form of petrol.
He had also locked the gate to the house, so if the fire had spread, the result for the residents inside would have been ""extremely grave with no accessible route of escape"".
The prosecutor added that the offence was premeditated, pointing to how the accused took steps to obtain the petrol and avoid police detection.
The defence asked for a shorter jail term, asking the court to show mercy and leniency.
Surenthiran will return to court for sentencing in December.
For mischief by fire, he could be jailed for up to seven years and fined."
Woman who scalded 5-year-old son to death gets life imprisonment for murder after prosecution appeals,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-who-scalded-5-year-old-son-death-gets-life-imprisonment-murder-after-prosecution-appeals-azlin-arujunah-ridzuan-mega-abdul-rahman-3012536,"SINGAPORE: A woman who scalded her five-year-old son to death has been sentenced by the Court of Appeal to life imprisonment.
In a written judgment issued on Tuesday (Oct 18), the court also ruled that her husband, who had already been sentenced to life imprisonment earlier, would face no caning.
Azlin Arujunah and her husband Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman, both 30 years old, had caused the death of their son by causing cumulative scald injuries on him by splashing or pouring hot water on him over a week in October 2016.
The boy suffered other abuse including being hit with a hanger, pinched with pliers and confined in a cage meant for the family cat. He limped in pain and had blisters and peeling skin from the repeated scalding.
Eventually, he fell forward while attacked with hot water in the toilet on Oct 22, 2016, and stopped moving. He was taken to hospital only after more than six hours as his parents were afraid of getting arrested.
The couple had claimed trial to charges of murder initially. They were acquitted of murder at first and given lesser charges of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by heated means. Their initial sentences were 27 years' jail each, with caning for Ridzuan and an additional 12 months' jail in lieu of caning for Azlin. 
The prosecution appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, convicting Azlin of murder. 






      Photos from court documents of the cage allegedly used to confine the boy, and the hot water dispenser purportedly used in the offences.
    






In a written judgment by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong, the court said the case presented ""an especially tragic set of facts"".
""The deceased was a young child whose death was caused by his own parents in circumstances that were cruel, inexcusable, and entirely avoidable,"" wrote the judges.
""However, it is also well established in our jurisprudence that, while cruelty or a display of inhumane treatment is a relevant consideration, the court 'should not be distracted by the gruesomeness of the scene of the crime' in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed.""
The prosecution had sought the death sentence for Azlin.
THE REASONS FOR NOT IMPOSING DEATH SENTENCE ON AZLIN
The court said the key factor weighing against the imposition of a death penalty for Azlin was the judge's finding that Azlin did not ""entirely comprehend the likelihood of death resulting from (her) actions"".
The trial judge also did not find on the evidence that Azlin intended to cause an injury that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, which is why the judge acquitted Azlin of the murder charges at first.
The Court of Appeal found that Azlin intended to cause the scald injuries without comprehending that there was at least a real possibility that they could kill her son.
Azlin had said in her statement to the police that she thought the injuries would heal on their own, citing her own experience as she had also been scalded by her parents as a child.
She also attempted to administer some ""self-help treatments"" on her son, even if these proved ""woefully inadequate"", the court noted.
For example, she bought cream from a provision shop to apply on the peeling skin on her son's arms and chest. She also used tap water to rinse her son after a scalding incident and put baby powder on his chest and stomach.
""None of this detracts from the horrific, unacceptable and vicious nature of the injuries,"" the court noted. ""Azlin was the mother of the deceased, and for her to intentionally commit the various acts of abuse against her young son is immensely disturbing.""
NO CANING FOR RIDZUAN
For Ridzuan, the court declined to order caning on him as the prosecution sought. The judges found that Ridzuan participated in only two of the four scalding incidents that led to his son's death. He also applied medicated oil on the boy and asked his aunt to apply baby powder on him.
The court said it would not ""double-count"" certain factors by increasing Ridzuan's life sentence further by adding on 12 strokes of the cane.
They cited the principle of parity, saying it should apply in this case even though husband and wife were convicted of different offences.
The principle of sentencing parity notes that ""where the roles and circumstances of the accused persons are the same, they should be given the same sentence unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances"", the court said.
""As the (trial) judge noted, it was Ridzuan who 'introduced a culture of violence into the family and home through his initial abuse of Azlin', and who carried out the first abusive act against the deceased,"" said the court. 
The more severe acts of abuse were carried out by Ridzuan, including using pliers on him, applying a heated spoon to his palm and punching his nose such that it fractured."
'We do way more than driving directions': The evolution of Google Maps and plans for Singapore users,"Google Maps will soon roll out eco-friendly directions in Singapore, which will provide users with an optimised route for lower petrol consumption. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/google-maps-singapore-users-cycling-directions-driving-eco-friendly-2988666,"SINGAPORE: It is used all over the world by people of different ages, different ethnicities and different nationalities.
But the importance of ""local nuances"" is not lost on Google's Head of Geo Christopher Phillips. And this is key when Google Maps rolls out eco-friendly routing to users in Singapore, he said.
With eco-friendly routing, Google Maps will show users the fastest route and the one that's most fuel-efficient. The feature has already been rolled out in the US and several European countries.
Mr Phillips leads both product and engineering for the Geo team, which is responsible for products like Google Maps and Google Earth. He did not say when eco-routing would be available in Singapore, but said it was a ""matter of time"".
""We thought it was really important that before we launch it, we recognise some of the local nuances. So even though we're building a global product and a lot of the algorithm and capabilities when we bring it here to Singapore - which we will - we want to actually take that and apply the information that we know that's more local,"" he said.
""There's a lot of factors that go into a proper calculation of your eco-route, including the climate, including the elevations, including the stop and start information around the trip. So we want to really make sure we get that right.""

At the same time, Mr Phillips pointed out that Singapore has been an ""important role model"" on how to think about transportation and planning.
It's not just about the size of the population, but where innovation and forward-thinking are happening and can inspire change in other locations, he said.
DEMAND FOR CYCLING ROUTES
Late last year, Maps unveiled its new cycling navigation feature in Singapore, which spans 6,800km of cycling trails and biking directions. Singapore is the first country in Southeast Asia where users can make use of this feature.
This was in part brought about by demand for cycling routes locally. In Singapore, Google saw a huge spike in searches for cycling routes last year, rising 75 per cent from 2020 and 400 per cent from 2019.
Google Maps has a ""vibrant, active"" user base of cyclists in Singapore, which helps the company prioritise where it can do more, said Mr Phillips.
""The more usage that we have, we can keep improving it. Because we can look at the information of how the route was successful, what we learned and that keeps making it better for everybody.""

On top of user interface changes, routes are also constantly being updated and optimised, he said. New information such as route elevation has also been added.
Feedback from cyclists as well as the authorities is extremely helpful, he said.
“How successful were they in the route? How close was our expected time of arrival to what we promised?
""More and more cities around the world - and Singapore is a great example - are investing in more safe cycling routes. We have a role we can play with the public officials as they're trying to encourage more cycling.""
Mr Phillips is keen to point out that Maps is not only a navigation tool for drivers.
“We do way more than driving directions ... We have great walking directions and great cycling (directions),"" he said.
""What's been really nice about all these sustainability features is the governments and the public authorities wanting to work with us. It's great, because we really do need it to be a partnership for it to be successful,"" he added.
IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE
Looking ahead, Maps aims to provide a more immersive experience for users, said Mr Phillips.
Earlier this year, Google announced that ""immersive view"", which allows users to see multi-dimensional views of an area with information like the weather, traffic and busyness layered on top, will be rolled out soon to Maps. More recently, Maps also launched 250 photorealistic aerial views of global landmarks.
""We're putting together satellite imagery, aerial imagery, street view imagery combined with user photos, and we're fusing it together to build like a photorealistic view of what a place is like,"" said Mr Phillips.

""It really goes beyond what we call a two-dimensional map of the world where you can drop in and see photos, which is kind of how we work today, to almost bringing it to life where ... (it is) like you're walking around before you go.""
It will be rolled out in the coming months in Los Angeles, London, New York, San Francisco and Tokyo on Android and iOS.
Immersive view allows people to better visualise things and is expected to be popular with younger users, said Mr Phillips.
""They really appreciate the visuals. We've always had really good text … but now the addition of this really cool large-scale visual imagery that feels like: 'Hey, the community of people doing reviews are contributing',"" he added.
""This highly visual experience is not just a pandemic thing, it's actually the future."""
Security guard attacked at logistics hub in Jurong,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/truck-driver-assault-security-guard-logistics-hub-jurong-face-bleeding-3011756,"SINGAPORE: A security guard was attacked at a logistics hub in Jurong last Thursday (Oct 13), after he alerted a truck driver that he did not follow procedures and safety protocols. 
The Union of Security Employees (USE) said in a Facebook post on Monday that it was alerted to the incident. Mr Suresh Subramaniam, a 51-year-old supervisor, was on duty at a logistics hub at Pioneer Crescent last Thursday at about 9.20am. 
He told a container truck driver that he did not follow procedures and safety protocols, said the union. The driver shouted at Mr Suresh.
As the driver exited the compound, he stopped his container truck on the roadside and proceeded to the guardhouse to confront the security guard.
The driver allegedly assaulted Mr Suresh a few times, resulting in injuries to his face. A colleague who was in the guardhouse rushed out when he heard the commotion. The driver was asked to leave, and he did.
Mr Suresh, who is employed by Spear Security Force, made a police report and was given three days leave after seeing a doctor.
In response to CNA's queries, the police said a 38-year-old man is assisting with investigations. 
Mr Mohd Faizal Khamis, managing director of Spear Security Force, said Mr Suresh returned to work on Monday and was coping well.
USE general secretary Raymond Chin, USE president Ardi Amir and USE executive secretary Steve Tan visited Mr Suresh on Monday afternoon and gave him some tonic and FairPrice vouchers.
""Our officers perform duties as ascribed to them by the Private Security Industry Act and must not be abused when doing so.
""Acts of abuse are despicable and the union will do our utmost to work with the authorities to protect our officers,"" said USE.

T. rex skeleton to go on display in Singapore ahead of Hong Kong auction,"The fossilised Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton will be displayed at Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall from Oct 28 to Oct 30.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tyrannosaurus-t-rex-skeleton-display-singapore-christies-auction-hong-kong-3011726,"SINGAPORE: The fossilised skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex will go on display in Singapore this month before it becomes the first such specimen to be offered at auction in Asia.
Nicknamed ""Shen"", or ""god-like"" in Chinese, the skeleton will be displayed at Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall from Oct 28 to Oct 30 as part of a preview for Christie's Hong Kong Autumn Auctions, which take place from Nov 25 to Dec 3.
According to Christie's, the value of the skeleton is estimated to be between HK$120 million and HK$200 million (US$15 million to US$25 million). It will go under the hammer on Nov 30.
Just two T. rex skeletons have previously been offered at auction: ""Sue"", which was sold by Sotheby’s for US$8.3 million in 1997, and ""Stan"", which was sold by Christie's for US$31.8 million in 2020.
The auction of Shen will be a first in Asia, which has also never had a T. rex on display in a museum, Christie's said.
Christie's had asked visitors to register for slots to visit the auction preview in Singapore. However, checks by CNA on Monday (Oct 17) evening showed that slots were no longer available. 
In response to a CNA query, a Christie's representative said that more booking slots would be released later in the week. 
Each registration is for one guest only, and each viewing slot lasts for 30 minutes.
The representative said that non-registered guests, or walk-ins, would be allowed, though the auction house could not guarantee how long they would have to wait to enter the display area.  
For the safety and comfort of visitors, visitors will be admitted on a ""one guest in, one guest out"" basis during peak times, the representative added.
The queue for walk-in visitors will be at the shaded foyer of the Arts House.
MUSCLE SCARS, BITE MARKS
Standing at 4.6m with a length of 12.2m, Shen weighs in at 1,400kg. 
The skeleton, which Christie's describes as being of ""museum standard"" and ""54 per cent represented by bone density"", was unearthed in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, the United States, in 2020.
It is an adult T. rex, likely a male, that would have lived about 66 million to 68 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period.
Its fossilised bones are ""well-preserved and quite solid"", Christie's said, noting that details such as muscle scars, bite marks and osteoarthritis are visible on them.
About 79 of the dinosaur's bones were mounted with additional cast elements in an ""anatomically accurate hunting pose"".
The auction comes with ""full rights and all soft assets"" relating to the skeleton, and the winning bidder will be able to give it a new name if they wish.

WHO COULD WIN IT?
To find out what kind of bidder might end up becoming the new owner of the T. rex, CNA spoke to Mr Francis Belin, president of Christie's Asia Pacific.
""Fossils of prehistoric creatures are extremely rare and highly sought after. They have captured the imagination of collectors ever since their discovery in the 19th and early 20th centuries. With each species discovered came new fascination,"" he told CNA.
""We expect interest from museums, cultural institutions and private individuals across the globe, of all ages and interests, who collect across multiple categories.""
Mr Belin said that the choice of Singapore as a location for the preview reflects Christie's ""continued commitment, investment and confidence in Singapore as the key centre for Southeast Asia"".
""Christie's have witnessed a surging appetite in Southeast Asia for our art and luxury categories, including objects of historical significance,"" he said.
Mr Belin said that he expects bidders from Singapore and Southeast Asia to be among those vying for the ownership of the skeleton.
""Buyers in Southeast Asia are increasingly sophisticated and selective across our categories – this is why we have responded with an unprecedented and diverse Autumn Auction preview in Singapore, that is thoughtfully curated and aims to shape and nurture their collecting tastes,"" he said.
Responding to a question about concerns among palaeontologists that putting rare fossils up for auction could result in specimens landing in the hands of private collectors and not museums, Mr Belin said: ""It is the will of the consigner that the skeleton be presented at auction, and Christie's are honoured to be the chosen platform.
""It is our role to offer an open, fair auction process, in which museums, cultural institutions and private individuals all have the ability to participate at the same time.""
""Given Shen the T. rex's scale and significance, it is possible that a private buyer may loan or donate the skeleton to a museum, and it is also possible that the skeleton will be purchased directly by a museum,"" he added.
""It is worth noting that only two T. rex skeletons have ever sold at auction, and both have gone to museums.""
Mr Belin highlighted that the consigner had also invested in scientific research by academic palaeontologists ""in the interest of accessibility, science and furthering knowledge"".
The Singapore preview of Christie's Hong Kong Autumn Auctions will also feature 20th- and 21st-century works from Asian and Western artists as well as luxury items such as watches, handbags and jewellery.
These will be on display at the Arts House from Oct 29 to Oct 30.

Wet weather expected to continue for the rest of October: Met Service,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wet-weather-continue-met-service-second-half-october-rain-3011621,"SINGAPORE: The current wet weather is expected to continue for the rest of October, with thundery showers expected on most days in the coming fortnight, said the Meteorological Service Singapore on Monday (Oct 17). 
In its fortnightly outlook, the Met Service said the inter-monsoon conditions are forecast to last through November. 
More showers can be expected over Singapore and the surrounding vicinity, and lightning activity tends to be higher during the inter-monsoon months than in other months of the year. 
In the coming fortnight, thundery showers are expected on most days, said the Met Service. On some days in the earlier half of the fortnight, widespread thundery showers with gusty winds may occur between the pre-dawn hours and morning. 
In the latter half of the fortnight, afternoon thundery showers are forecast on most days, with the showers extending into the evening on a few of these days.
On a few days, widespread moderate to heavy thundery showers can be expected, due to large-scale convergence of winds over Singapore and the surrounding region.
""Overall, the rainfall for October is expected to be well above average over most parts of Singapore,"" said the Met Service. 
For the rest of the month, the daily temperature on most days is forecast to range between 24 and 33 degrees Celsius. 
Although showers are expected on most days, the daily maximum temperature could still reach a high of about 34 degrees Celsius on a few days. Additionally, the wet weather may bring daily temperatures of between 23 and 32 degrees Celsius on a few days. 
FIRST HALF OF OCTOBER
Thundery showers fell over Singapore on a few nights in the first half of October.
A daily total rainfall of 138.1mm was recorded at Pasir Panjang on the morning of Oct 5. This was the highest rainfall recorded in a day in the first half of October, said the Met Service.
On 11 days in the first fortnight of October, the daily maximum temperature was lower than 33 degrees Celsius.
The wet weather also brought several days with cool night-time temperatures. There were nine days with daily minimum temperatures of 23 degrees Celsius or less. 
The temperature at Jurong Island dropped to 21.9 degrees Celsius during the showers on Oct 12. It was the lowest daily minimum temperature for the first half of the month. 
Well above average rainfall was recorded across Singapore in the first half of October, said the Met Service. The highest anomaly of 318 per cent above average was recorded around the Kent Ridge area, while the anomaly was lowest at Paya Lebar at 19 per cent above average.

"New private home sales more than double in September, driven by Lentor Modern, SkyEden@Bedok launches",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ura-private-home-sales-september-2022-lentor-modern-sky-eden-3011411,"SINGAPORE: New private home sales in Singapore more than doubled in September from a month earlier, driven by the launches of Lentor Modern and Sky Eden@Bedok.
Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers sold 987 units last month, up from the revised 438 units in August, according to figures released on Monday (Oct 17) by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
This is the highest number of sales since May, when developers sold 1,355 units excluding ECs.
Ms Christine Sun, OrangeTee and Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics, said: ""New home sales in September climbed to the second-highest level this year on pent-up demand for suburban homes.""
On a year-on-year basis, home sales in September rose 18.3 per cent from the 834 units sold in the same month last year.
Sales in September were boosted by the launch of two suburban projects: Lentor Modern, which sold 512 units, and Sky Eden@Bedok, which sold 121 units.
Ms Sun called the sales figures at Lentor Modern and Sky Eden@Bedok ""astounding"".
""Although their median launch prices were above S$2,100 psf, both projects sold well, moving 84.6 per cent or 512 units at Lentor Modern and 76.6 per cent or 121 units at Sky Eden@Bedok within a month,"" she said.
""The sales performance of both projects was astounding, considering their price points, interest rate hikes and growing uncertainties on the macroeconomic front.""
Ms Sun added that demand remains strong due to a lack of home supply in the suburbs and because Housing Board (HDB) upgraders who sold their flats in recent months need replacement homes.
Huttons Asia's senior director for research Lee Sze Teck said that the number of units launched in September jumped 6.8 times compared to the 134 units launched in August.
""Despite the higher volume of units launched for sale, monthly sales have once again exceeded the launch units, reflecting the strong demand for private homes,"" Mr Lee said.
""This is the 13th month that sales have exceeded units launched for sale.""
The Outside Central Region (OCR) saw the most number of units sold at 686, followed by the Core Central Region (CCR) at 198 units and the Rest of Central Region (RCR) at 103 units.
Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Property Services, noted the surge in OCR sales compared to last month's figures.
""Among all the market segments, OCR had the highest growth in the number of new home sales in September. The number of units sold in OCR increased from a mere 90 units in August to an astounding 686 units in September,"" he said.
""There have been few significant new non-landed condo launches in the OCR segment aside from Amo Residence in July. As a result, interest from pent-up demand fuelled longing buyers and investors who were probably chomping at the bit.""
Mr Mohan added that buyers and investors are ""starting to embrace the new benchmark price points since the availability of new launches in OCR has been dwindling"".
""They are becoming acclimatised to the fact that projects in the OCR would typically have a price point of S$2,000 per square foot or more moving forward,"" he said.
The proportion of purchases made by foreigners dipped to 4.8 per cent in September, compared to 12.7 per cent a month earlier, according to URA and Huttons Research.
""As almost 70 per cent of the sales in September were in the OCR, foreigners made up a smaller share of the overall sales,"" Mr Lee said.

New private home sales rise nearly 71% in July, driven by AMO Residence



















New private home sales fall 47.6% in August amid lack of launches during Hungry Ghost month













LOOKING AHEAD
Moving forward, the introduction of property cooling measures could have a moderate impact on private home sales, said Ms Sun.
""New cooling measures were introduced on Sep 30, 2022. The calculation of the total debt servicing ratio was increased by 0.5 percentage points for property loans granted by private financial institutions,"" she said.
""While the change will reduce the loan quantum available to homebuyers, there could be a moderate impact on the private residential market.
""The revision was widely expected, and many borrowers were already exercising prudence as they knew that interest rates may continue to rise next year.""
Depleting unsold inventory and a lack of major launches in October are also likely to cap sales at about 300 to 400 units, Mr Lee said.
However, Ms Sun noted that there could be strong demand for units at two EC projects that will be launched by the end of the year: Copen Grand in Tengah and Tenet in Tampines.
""Despite the cooling measures, demand for these ECs is expected to be robust owing to the limited supply of ECs in the market,"" she said.
""Currently, most EC projects have been fully sold except North Gaia, which was launched this year. As prices of new suburban condos continue to rise, we may expect more eligible buyers to turn to the EC market as these homes are still more affordable and value for money.""
Two launches in the CCR in November – Hill House and Sophia Regency – could also boost sales, said Mr Lee.
""The quantum for these two projects is very attractive for those who desire to own a prime District 9 address,"" he said, adding that Kovan Jewel in the OCR may also be launched for sale in November.
The new 15-month waiting time for private residential property owners and former private residential property owners to purchase resale HDB flats may also affect the market, said Mr Mohan.
""Some private property owners who are looking to right size or downsize into the HDB resale market will now be starting behind the eight ball,"" he said.
""Hence, these private property owners who are unable to wait the 15-month period might consider smaller private resale condos instead.
""Alternatively, they might consider looking into the new launch market, especially developments that are about to hit their Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in the immediate future. Projects that are about to be completed might garner more interest from savvy buyers and investors as a form of likely alternative to those considering to right size or downsize as well.""

It is the 40th workplace fatality this year, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Monday.
According to the ministry, the Grab driver was ferrying a passenger along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 towards Buangkok Green. He was making a discretionary right turn at the junction of Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 when a lorry travelling in the opposite direction collided with his car at about 1pm.
The Grab driver was taken unconscious to hospital where he later died from his injuries.
His passenger, a 33-year-old woman, and the lorry driver were conscious when they were taken to hospital, said the police. 
""The 55-year-old male lorry driver and a 65-year-old male bus driver are assisting with police investigations,"" they added.
In response to CNA's queries, Grab said it is providing support to the driver's family.
""We are very saddened by this incident and wish to express our deepest condolences to our late driver-partner's family,"" the company said.
""We are also checking on the passenger to provide our assistance. We sincerely urge all road users to look out for each other's well-being and work together to keep our roads safe.""
There has been an increase in the number of workplace fatalities. The 40 fatalities reported so far this year exceed the figure of 37 reported for the whole of last year. 
It prompted the Manpower Ministry to impose a mandatory safety time-out last month for companies in higher-risk sectors.

Local film #LookAtMe barred from screening in Singapore over potential to cause social division,"The film, directed by Ken Kwek and starring Adrian Pang, denigrates a religious community, say Singapore authorities.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/film-lookatme-ken-kwek-religion-homosexuality-pastor-barred-screening-3011331,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has disallowed the screening of local film #LookAtMe because it denigrates a religious community, authorities said on Monday (Oct 17).
The film was refused classification because it has ""the potential to cause enmity and social division in Singapore’s multi-racial and multi-religious society"", said a joint statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).
The film, which is set in Singapore and directed by Singaporean director Ken Kwek, indicates to the audience in the opening frame that it is ""inspired by true events"". #LookAtMe, Kwek's second feature film, premiered at the New York Asian Film Festival in July.
The film’s protagonist is offended by a pastor’s stance on homosexuality, on behalf of his gay brother, and uploads an ""incendiary"" social media post about the pastor, played by Adrian Pang.
The post goes viral, and this leads to a series of events that causes the family much grief.
""Various descriptions of the pastor (including a similar sounding title) are suggestive of a real pastor in Singapore. Persons in Singapore may draw that connection. The context may be seen to be suggesting or encouraging violence against the pastor,"" said the statement.
The protagonist also plots a revenge attack on the pastor, and the pastor is seen engaging in an act ""prohibited by his professed religious faith"", said the authorities.
Authorities said that the film has the potential to cause enmity and social division in Singapore because the pastor preaches against homosexuality but engages in behaviour that goes against his religious teachings.
The reference to ""true events"" implies that religious leaders in Singapore have engaged in such behaviour, they added.
Another point of concern was that the protagonist declares his intention and makes preparations to violently attack a religious figure, the authorities said.
""The allegations may be perceived to offensive, defamatory and contrary to the (Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act), in that it may be seen as unfairly attacking a religious figure, as well as cause offence to religious beliefs.""
IMDA had sought the views of its advisory committees and was guided by the Film Classification guidelines, the statement added.
The Film Classification guidelines state that the ""classification should be sensitive to the concerns of different racial or religious groups and the need to safeguard racial and religious harmony"". It also states that ""films that are likely to denigrate any racial or religious group should be refused classification"".  
Earlier this year, Singapore refused classification to The Kashmir Files, a Hindi movie on the exodus of Hindus from the disputed Muslim-majority Kashmir region.
Kwek is an author, filmmaker and playwright as well as the writer and director of Connections, a film that was interwoven with a live performance at this year's National Day Parade. His first feature film, released in 2014, was Unlucky Plaza. 
An anthology of short films directed by Kwek, Sex.Violence.FamilyValues, also ran into trouble with the authorities 10 years ago. It was pulled from release for dialogue that was seen to be racist, then edited and reclassified, before being re-released months later.
Kwek and the producers of #LookAtMe said in a statement that they are disappointed by the decision and will be submitting an appeal to ask IMDA to reconsider its classification.
""#LookAtMe is a work of cinematic fiction. The film seeks to entertain and encourage conversations on important social issues that are relevant to Singapore,"" they said in a statement.
""It features top filmmaking and acting talent from Singapore and beyond. The film premiered in July at the New York Asian Film Festival, where it was in competition for Best Feature and won a Special Jury award for Best Performance.
""We hope Singapore residents are given an opportunity to see this film at the Singapore International Film Festival, which has selected the film for its 2022 edition.
""We hope IMDA will consider our appeal and reverse the ban, in time for its planned screening in December, and subsequent general release."""
Food charities in Singapore provide healthier alternatives even as donations drop,"The charities have also been striving to reduce food waste. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/charities-fewer-donations-healthier-food-3011236,"SINGAPORE: Food charities in Singapore have been receiving fewer donations this year, leading to groups reaching into their own pockets to continue funding beneficiaries while helping them to maintain a healthy level of nutrition.
Donations to Food from the Heart have dropped by about 10 per cent to 15 per cent from last year, said the charity’s chief executive Robin Lee, citing the improvement in the COVID-19 situation and inflation as possible reasons.
“During COVID times people did not travel. There are not many things to do, there was maybe a little bit to spare (for people) to donate more,” he said.
Corporate funding that may have been diverted from arts and sporting organisations to groups like his during the pandemic is also starting to decrease, Mr Lee added.
















He noted that inflation has also meant higher food prices.
“The price of food has gone up a lot (so) they (donors) might have other obligations for the expenses,” he said.
Food from the Heart gave out about 47,000 packs filled with rations to the needy in 2019. This year, it is on track to distribute about 140,000, a three-fold increase.
The charity has to supplement its supply of food, he said, adding that it has been organising food drives for the past three months.
“It was quite successful. Singaporeans are really stepping up and coming out to help us,” he said.
Supporters and sponsors - food manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers - have also increased their prices only slightly so the charity does not have to fork out too much more, he said.
MOVING TOWARDS HEALTHIER FOOD
Another charity, The Food Bank Singapore, has also received fewer donations. Its founder Nichol Ng said donations “exploded” in 2020, but there has been some “donor fatigue” this year.
Compared to both 2020 and last year, there has been a drop of 30 per cent to 40 per cent in cash donations, she said. The number of bulk food donations has also fallen. Her charity helps about 30,000 people a year.
But while the quantity of donations is declining, the quality is going up.
Both charities have been including healthier items in their food packs, and donors are also contributing more of such wholesome food.
For instance, The Food Bank Singapore swapped its regular rice vermicelli for brown rice.
Every food bundle has a balance of carbohydrates, vegetables, and proteins, Ms Ng said.
“The other change that we also did, I think, along with many other charity organisations, is the inclusion of fresh food products inside, so vegetables and from time to time sometimes by the request of donors, possibly fresh protein as well,” she said.
Food from the Heart includes brown rice and red vermicelli instead of white rice and white vermicelli.
However, this does not mean that everything in a food bundle must be healthy all the time.
“It's okay to indulge from time to time ... so we do still accept some of the nicer sweets or chocolate or potato chips,” said Ms Ng.
Mr Lee said that his organisation does not get too many unhealthy food items in donations, as people can distinguish between healthy and unhealthy food.
HEALTHY DOES NOT MEAN EXPENSIVE
While there is a perception that healthier food tends to be more expensive, this is not necessarily the case, said dietician Jaclyn Reutens.
A meal that includes white or brown rice, tofu, egg and one or two vegetables, is well-balanced, said Ms Reutens, who founded Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants.
“You don't need to have brown rice and your salmon or your cod fish, with the broccoli and your capsicum to make it a very well-balanced meal,” she said.
Canned food, while preserved in salt water, can also be part of a healthy well-balanced diet, she added.
While certain processed food like nuggets, cookies and sausages are unhealthier than, for instance, canned corn, these can still be consumed, depending on frequency and quantity.
“I think people really need to redefine what healthy eating means,” said Ms Reutens. For example, just because you are unable to afford organic food does not mean you are doing a disservice to your family, she added.
PREVENTING FOOD WASTE
Both Food from the Heart and The Food Bank Singapore have been striving to prevent food waste.
Mr Lee said his charity avoids overserving by working closely with community partners.
When it comes to school goodie bags, if there are two eligible siblings in the same school, they make sure they give it to only one sibling. One such bag of 15 items is expected to be good for a family of four for a month.
The charity also collects cans of food that are slightly dented and nearer to their expiry date, which would have otherwise gone to waste.
Food that is too near expiry to be included in food packs is shared with other charities such as Willing Hearts and The Hiding Place, which serve cooked food, said Mr Lee.
His organisation is also able to make better purchases based on analytics done by OCBC Bank that show what people consume and how much.

Ms Ng said her organisation takes note of when a beneficiary appears to have stock of a certain food, and may not give them more of the same item.
Instead of giving out food bundles, her charity is working on letting beneficiaries shop at the supermarket or wet market themselves to pick what they want.
“Because the other part of the waste actually comes from food that's distributed, but people don't want to eat or they don't consume it,” she said.
“We must remember that every donor’s dollar right now is really very precious, not a single dollar or a single packet of food should actually be wasted.”"
Nurturing the next generation of creative thinkers: Schools to include design education in curriculum,"By 2050, students in Singapore are expected to be able to use design to solve complex real-world problems such as an ageing population.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/schools-design-education-curriculum-3011226,"SINGAPORE: Schools will be incorporating design education in their curriculum by 2050, with the aim of getting students to use design to solve complex problems. 
The move will go towards nurturing Singapore’s next generation of creative thinkers, who are expected to use their design know-how to address real-world issues such as climate change and an ageing population. 
Already, some schools have made design education a part of the curriculum. Their students’ inventions have also made a difference, especially for seniors, according to the schools. 
At Northland Secondary School, students use specialised goggles and simulators that recreate the effects of ageing, such as deteriorating eyesight and hand tremours. These tools help students put themselves in the shoes of seniors who face mobility and visual problems. 
The school in Yishun offers an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that focuses on using technology to improve the well-being of the elderly. ALPs are meant to help students learn through hands-on experience. 
UNDERSTANDING PROBLEMS
Student Kyara Akber said she got to learn about ageing and the challenges that seniors face, including the simple tasks “that we can do easily in a few seconds, but they take minutes to do”.
“Now, I understand what the elderly face daily, and it is not easy,” she added. 
The students, with some guidance from their teachers, have also come up with different inventions to help the elderly. 
For example, they have created plant stands to remind seniors to water their plants. Simple coding is used, with a red display showing when the soil is dry and requires watering.

Mr Aaron Rajoo, a teacher at Northland Secondary School, said the students are presented with opportunities to figure out how to approach the more complex issues. 
“We wanted to start with this idea of empathy first, so that we could properly define the problem. So, whatever we came up with to solve the issue was actually making a difference,” he said. 
With a clear structure, the students are “able to find a solid foundation to ideate in complex situations”, he added.

TACKLING COMPLEX ISSUES
Institutes of Higher Learning are also using design to tackle complex real-world problems. 
At the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), some students have worked with the Changi General Hospital to construct a pavilion next to Block 70 Bedok South Road, with designs that encourage seniors to stay active. 
The team considered various age-friendly features, including ergonomic structures, for the pavilion, said SUTD architecture student Ian Chung. “We also incorporated armrests and also a large table for them to have their own activities (as well as) some gardening areas.”
But beyond design, the university is hoping to add artificial intelligence into the mix.
""We are a technology university at the end of the day, so we are always kind of feeling the pulse of what is going on,” said Dr Thomas Schroepfer, an architecture and sustainable design professor at SUTD. 
He added that Singapore could even be a role model when it comes to designing solutions for future cities."

Earlier Ms Sun Xueling who is the Member of Parliament for Punggol West, where Sumang Lane is situated, said in a Facebook post that she had ""received several notifications from concerned residents about a video circulating of a person apparently carrying a sword and lashing out at passersby at Sumang Lane"". 
""I have checked with sources who indicated that it is a filming in progress and not a “real” incident,"" said Ms Sun.
ACTUAL INCIDENT IN MARCH
In March, two people were injured by a man carrying a sword in Buangkok. Passing cars were also damaged. 
Six members of the public, who were later given police awards, helped restrain the man before he was arrested by responding police officers.

Otter family that established home in Seletar estate transferred out after earlier reports of intrusion,"Otters that make their homes in residential areas where they are unable to access their natural food sources will be transferred out, said Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/otter-family-seletar-kill-fish-transfer-residential-estate-nparks-monitor-3011076,"SINGAPORE: A group of otters that made their home in a residential area in Seletar was transferred out last week and relocated to a place where they could access their natural food sources.
The transfer comes after media reports earlier this year stated that a group of otters in Seletar had entered a private home and killed more than 50 fish in a pond.
The National Parks Board (NParks) said on Monday (Oct 17) that it is closely monitoring otters in residential areas.
Otters that establish homes - known as holts - in residential estates where they are unable to access their natural food sources will be transferred to areas where they can do so, NParks outlined in a media factsheet. 
Singapore has seen a growing otter population and increasing encounters between humans and smooth-coated otters in recent years.
There are currently about 170 otters in about 17 families with several groups such as the Bishan, Marina and Zouk families being more prominent.
Over the years, otters have been spotted crossing roads in the central business district as well as eating pet fish at condominiums and other private estates. 
Last year, a man was reportedly attacked by otters and sustained more than 20 wounds during a trip to the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
According to figures from NParks, there were 208 instances of feedback relating to otters in 2020, and 305 in 2021. Majority of the feedback was related to otter sightings.

In a Facebook post on Monday, Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said that residents have had a number of recent encounters with the otters in residential estates.
""While otters largely stay within the waterways, they may occasionally visit residential properties with ponds as the fish there are easy prey for them.
""NParks and the (Otter Working Group) have been working with residents and estate managers to implement measures to prevent otters from entering, such as meshing up gaps in gates and erecting otter-proof barriers for ponds. With these measures in place, the otters are likely to move on as they are unable to access the ponds for food,"" Mr Tan said. 
The Otter Working Group was formed in 2014 and includes the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, Mandai Wildlife Group, the National University of Singapore, NParks, OtterCity, OtterWatch, PAssion Wave and national water agency PUB. 
In the cases of otters who establish holts - holes in the ground for resting and sleeping - in residential areas, NParks will work with the Otter Working Group to transfer the otters out, said Mr Tan. 
""This is for the welfare of these otters and to mitigate any issues that could arise from human-wildlife encounters, such as when residents face incursions into their ponds.""
A representative of the Otter Working Group, Bernard Seah told the media on Monday that otters do not usually stay in one holt nor do they just forage in one estate. 
""Most (otter) families are transient and moving from point A to point B ... they may come back to point A again but they are transient in that sense that they will move through their territory over and over again,"" he added.

TRANSFER IN SELETAR
In Seletar, three adult otters and three pups were transferred to an undisclosed location in NParks' first such operation last week. 
Ahead of the transfer, NParks and the Otter Working Group assessed the situation and monitored the otters to find out their behaviour patterns, the locations of ponds they fed at, and their suitability for transfer. They also studied when the otters were most active in order to plan the operation. 
Otter watchers found that the estate had become the otters' main foraging ground and that they were not in the main waterways around the area, according to NParks.  
""To secure the otters, perimeter fencing was installed around the holt, and once the otters were secured, they were transferred to an area where they have access to their natural food sources. Vets were involved to ensure the health and welfare of the otters,"" NParks said. 
The otters are currently being monitored in their new holt, Mr Tan said in his Facebook post.

OTTERS IMPORTANT TO ECOSYSTEM
Otters are found in waterways and reservoirs and are natural predators which control the fish population in these areas, hence ensuring a healthy ecosystem, according to a media factsheet issued by NParks. 
In Singapore's urban environment, otter populations are limited by the ""carrying capacity"" or amount of resources in an area, as well as the availability of suitable habitats. 
As otters are highly territorial, they will compete for space and the resulting mortalities will limit the expansion of the population. 
However, there are some otters, usually groups consisting of two to three adults, that have split off from larger families and made their homes in residential estates. 
When such groups are identified, NParks will assess the situation before working with the Otter Working Group to transfer them.

In past years, NParks has been engaging homeowners and estate managers to prevent otters from entering compounds by identifying and blocking off entry points, such as covering gaps with mesh. 
Home owners have also been advised to block off fish ponds or cover them with netting, to prevent otters from getting at pet fish. 
""Otters are generally shy animals and will not attack unless provoked or when they feel threatened,"" said NParks. 
""When encountering otters, the public can observe them from a safe distance, and avoid feeding, touching chasing, cornering or approaching them especially when there are pups as the adults can be protective over their young when approached by humans.""

Cyclists get dedicated on-road cycling lane at Seletar under six-month trial ,"The trial is in response to feedback from riders who want more space on the roads. The only other on-road cycling lane is along Tanah Merah Coast Road.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/seletar-cycling-lane-trial-3010981,"SINGAPORE: Cyclists now have a new dedicated cycling lane, under a trial that allows them to ride safely along a popular Seletar stretch on Sunday mornings. 
Every Sunday, a 4.6km stretch of West Camp Road in Seletar Aerospace Park will belong to cyclists from 5am to 11am. 
The six-month trial, which started on Sunday (Oct 16), is in response to feedback from riders who want more space on the roads. The only other on-road cycling lane is along Tanah Merah Coast Road.
The new cycling lane – in both directions of West Camp Road – is marked out by solid blue lines. The operating hours are indicated on the signboards and the road itself.
Buses can also use the lane during those fixed hours, but other vehicles are barred from the road that typically has relatively light traffic on weekend mornings.  
PREVENTING CONFLICTS
The pilot aims to improve the riding experience for cyclists, some of whom have come into conflict with motorists while on their rides.
""If there is tension between the different road users, it's not healthy for active mobility to take off,” said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng, who was speaking to reporters at the launch of the cycling lane on Sunday.
“So, when rules are clear, people understand and accept them, it will promote a better culture of sharing our space.""
He added that the group size limits for cyclists at both cycling lanes in Tanah Merah Coast Road and West Camp Road will be removed. 
Under current rules that kicked in on Jan 1, cycling groups on roads are capped at five riders in single file, or 10 if cycling two abreast.

Cyclists welcome move to pilot on-road cycling lane in Seletar













Seletar Aerospace Park, which is home to several aerospace companies, is a popular spot for cycling, said cycling enthusiasts, who welcomed the move, especially given that more people have appeared to start riding during the COVID-19 pandemic.
One cyclist, however, was concerned about how the dedicated cycling lane will be enforced, and it could be complicated as “there is a very limited window from 5am to 11am"".
KEEPING CYCLISTS SAFE
The Land Transport Authority will use the pilot to gather feedback from users and assess the impact on traffic before deciding if there is scope to roll out such lanes in other areas.
Meanwhile, a new road safety guide will help motorists and cyclists to use the shared space safely. 
Singapore Cycling Federation president Hing Siong Chen said the dedicated space will help to keep cyclists safe. 
“So, you can bring new cyclists who are not very confident with riding with heavy vehicles or other vehicles, they can actually come in and cycle because this lane is just primarily meant for them,” said Dr Hing, a family physician.
If the trial takes off, it may even be replicated in other areas, including the Central Business District, said Mr Steven Lim, a member of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel.
“We are asking more people to move about using bicycles. And if this model actually works after this trial, we can always replicate this in other areas, and even in the CBD."""
14-year-old among two suspects arrested in Katong Shopping Centre robbery,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/14-year-old-teenager-man-arrested-alleged-robbery-theft-gun-shaped-lighter-katong-shopping-centre-3010926,"SINGAPORE: A 14-year-old male and a 36-year-old man have been arrested for their alleged involvement in a robbery at Katong Shopping Centre.
The police were alerted to the incident at a shop in the mall at 9.55pm last Friday (Oct 14).
The suspects are accused of threatening a victim with a gun-shaped lighter, restraining him and stealing S$900 in cash from him, the police said in a media release on Monday.
They fled after the victim shouted for help, but the gun-shaped lighter was left behind at the scene.
No one was hurt, said the police, adding that the pair were arrested within 24 hours. Cash was recovered from them.
The police said further investigations revealed that they were also involved in a case of theft in dwelling at Sims Place on Oct 15 at about 12.30am - less than three hours after the alleged robbery at Katong Shopping Centre.
""A 40-year-old female victim allegedly lost two watches, a necklace and a bag,"" the police said.
In relation to this case, a 31-year-old woman was arrested for dishonestly receiving stolen property. A necklace was recovered from her and seized for investigations.
The teenager and the man were charged in court on Monday with robbery. The offence carries a jail term of between three and 14 years and at least 12 strokes of the cane. 
Those found guilty of theft in dwelling face a jail term of up to seven years and a fine. 
If convicted of theft in dwelling, offenders face imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine. 
The offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property carries a jail term of five years, a fine or both."
"The Big Read: Crowds are back at malls, but are happy days here again for brick-and-mortar retailers?",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/malls-retail-crowds-shopping-online-experiential-3009116,"SINGAPORE: As the COVID-19 rules in Singapore were progressively eased this year, Ms Melody Ann Gibson decided to resume one of her favourite pastimes which she had to put on hold for more than two years: In-store shopping.
While it was still possible to shop even when the restrictions were in place, the 26-year-old interior designer found herself mostly staying home due to the hassle involved just to visit a store.
She would not only have to don a mask, but more than likely also have to wait in line due to the SafeEntry system, or a cap on the maximum occupancy, to enter a mall or a shop.
“I was also afraid of catching COVID-19 when the infection numbers were high, and passing it on to my family.”
But now that life has resumed some sense of normalcy, as Singapore tries to live with the virus, Ms Gibson finds herself heading out to the malls a little earlier when she makes an appointment to meet her friends.
This gives her time to walk around and discover the latest fashion collections or ongoing sales.
“There's definitely this desire to just get myself out there,” said Ms Gibson, who estimates that she goes window shopping about three to four times a week now.
“There are people who always say online shopping is better, but for me, I honestly enjoy shopping physically because I'm able to touch the clothes and try them on. To me, it’s just like therapy.”
Still, Ms Gibson said she was also looking for new things to do in Singapore. So it was serendipitous that she and a friend discovered a pleated bag-making workshop organised by Singaporean-Israeli fashion label Ginlee Studio.
Ms Gibson described the experience as enjoyable, as she not only learned about the process of making a bag, but got to leave with one that was customised according to her taste.
“One thing I don’t like about shopping in Singapore is that … there are only a very limited number of different (brands) around. So if a person buys an item, you will definitely see 10 others on the street having the same thing,” she said.
“What draws me to workshops is that I can customise things exactly to what I like, and I would know that no one else in Singapore would have it as well.”
Programmes by retailers such as Ginlee’s workshop are part of a strategy known as experiential retail that businesses are increasingly adopting.
The concept is basically the practice of giving a customer a full experience of a product — in some cases, both in-store and online.

LATEST BUZZWORDS: EDU-RETAIL, RETAIL-TAINMENT
The intention to allow customers like Ms Gibson to learn the fundamentals of pleating a bag and reconnect the user to their products was partly the reason why Ms Gin Lee, co-founder of the eponymously named label, launched the Make In Shop Experience programme in October 2020.
Singapore was then in Phase 2 of the ""circuit breaker"" period, which allowed most businesses to resume operations, with social gatherings in groups of up to five.
Ms Lee said, however, that even before the pandemic hit Singapore’s shores, there was already talk within the industry in 2019 about the concept of experiential retail because “people were bored by transactional malls”.
“In Singapore, we are surrounded by them,” said the 44-year-old. “So at that point, there were a lot of questions about how to make retail more experiential.”
Some ideas included having cafes within the store, however, Ms Lee and her partner, Mr Tamir Niv, decided to focus on the experience that their brand has strength in.
“Every mall needs a differentiator to give people a reason to visit,” she said.
And with e-commerce continuing its upward trajectory, retail experts — and consumers alike — said it would be necessary for brick-and-mortar shops to offer something unique to entice customers to make purchases with them.

As Singaporeans turn to online shopping and continue to shun DIY, are hardware stores dying?













Mr Guillaume Sachet, a partner in KPMG Singapore's advisory practice, said the pandemic has changed the retail landscape in many ways and accelerated the growth of online shopping.
In order for physical stores to compete with their virtual counterparts, they will have to do something unique, said Professor Lawrence Loh of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.
Otherwise, they will have to lower their prices, though there is only so much they can do so without hurting their bottom line due to higher overhead costs, he said.
The competition that physical stores face from e-commerce has been well-documented, with real estate agency JLL saying in its latest property market outlook report for Singapore that the proportion of online retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, rose from an average of 6.8 per cent in 2019, to an average of 15.9 per cent last year.
The figure, said JLL in its report published in August, remained at an average of 14.9 per cent between January and May this year, even as the lifting of COVID-19 measures encouraged more community activities.
A similar report from another real estate company, Knight Frank, observed that the rise in footfall at the malls corresponds with a moderation in the volume of online sales as many consumers reverted to physical shopping and dining.
Said Mr Sachet: “Now, post-pandemic, we have observed another shift in consumer behaviour where shoppers are adopting a mix of physical and online shopping but expecting personalisation and differentiation from brands.
“This has evolved into what we call ‘experiential retail’ — an immersive experience across channels, both in-store and online.”
A report this year by financial technology firm Adyen on the retail sector found that nearly seven in 10 consumers expect shopping in physical stores to be about “pleasure and excitement”.
Mr Sachet said this is because many consumers, particularly younger ones, now care far more about experiences than products. “The world is moving towards experiences and retailers need to take action,” he said.
Prof Loh also observed the emergence of two trends when it comes to experiential retail: Businesses are either offering what he calls “edu-retail” for enhancing a shopper’s product knowledge, or “retail-tainment” which is using retail marketing as entertainment, to generate a memorable experience for the consumer.
Ms Gauri Talathi-Lamb, the chief executive officer of du Boulay Contracts, a commercial refurbishment contractor under the MBH Group, suggested another factor behind the demand for experiential retail.
She said that in the past, people would go to a place of worship, or to some other community gathering spot, to have conversations with their neighbours.
“Since COVID, however, that has been disrupted quite a lot and the younger generations are missing that ability to connect with the community ... people are missing that community element.”
As such, Ms Talathi-Lamb believes that the main goal of experiential retail is to provide people with a community element that they had been missing.
COMMUNITIES FIRST, BUSINESS LATER
Indeed, for most of the retailers TODAY spoke to, community-building seemed to be top of the agenda when it comes to experiential retail.
Over at Midview City along Sin Ming Lane, Living Shrimply co-founders Eugene Ng, 26, and Chean Shao Jie, 24, had the vision of an aquarium store that was more than a place to pick up supplies for the hobby when they turned their e-commerce business into a physical shop in February.






      Living Shrimply co-founders Eugene Ng (right), 26, and Chean Shao Jie, 24, wanted to create a space where they could share relevant information with the aquascaping community. (Photo: TODAY/Ili Nadhirah Mansor)
    






Mr Chean said that the aquascaping community is not large, and it is daunting for anyone trying to get into the craft of arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks and other natural elements, in an aquarium tank due to the sheer amount of information available.
To make it easier for beginners, they wanted to create a space where they could share the relevant information with those who needed it.
But in order to convince hobbyists that they know what they are talking about, the men created what Mr Ng jokingly refers to as a “budget S.E.A Aquarium” — a reference to the tourist attraction at Resorts World Sentosa.
Immediately on the right after entering the store, visitors can step into a darkened gallery where beautifully landscaped slices of nature — from a tropical jungle-themed paludarium to aquatic tanks popping with vibrant hues of red and green — are highlighted on all four walls.
In the centre is a cushioned bench for visitors to sit and admire the works of art — much akin to a museum.
The owners said some visitors make a special trip down to the store just to see the tank displays, after learning about them on social media.
That said, no one is pressed into buying anything when they visit and the men are more than happy to just provide information about the hobby.
Taking a similar approach in Orchard Road is Zall Bookstore, which originated from China. It opened in February last year near where the iconic Borders bookstore used to be at the Wheelock Place shopping mall.
The Chinese-language bookshop occupies two levels — the first floor houses a cafe, as well an event space, while the second features an art gallery that is regularly refreshed.






      Zall Bookstore, a Chinese-language bookshop at Orchard Road, has an art gallery on the second floor. (Photo: TODAY/Ooi Boon Keong)
    






The black-and-white design of the store is inspired by calligraphy and the architecture of the Jiangnan water town in China, with a circular arch resembling a river bridge. Seating areas are also available on both levels.
Ms Laura Yan Ge, the general manager of the store, said these design choices were deliberate as they wanted to create an “atmosphere that slows you down”.
“Orchard is so fast-paced with its fashion stores, restaurants, hotels and office buildings,” said the 24-year-old. “At Zall, we allow you to sit in the store, and we invite you to open a book and read it … We don’t expect you to have to buy it.”
Her father, writer-poet Yan Zhi, founded the bookstore in 2013. Singapore is the firm’s first foray into a foreign market outside of China’s Wuhan city.
Ms Yan said the bookstore’s aim is to encourage patrons to put down their electronic devices and rediscover the joy of reading a physical book.
“In this environment, you can have a nice cup of coffee and when you’re tired from reading, you can walk upstairs to the art gallery and take a break. You can easily spend two or three hours here,"" she said. 
“And then, slowly, you might have this habit of reading again. And I think that's what is more important for us.""
Aside from providing a conducive environment for reading, Zall also organises various events, such as photography workshops, which provide the bookstore with an opportunity to sell relevant books to participants.
Both Living Shrimply and Zall acknowledged that while their respective business strategies do not always immediately lead to sales, it helps to build a bond with their customers who return to buy something at a later date.
“It’s better for us to focus on relationship-building than hard selling. No one wants to be forced to buy something. It drives them away,” said Mr Chean.

At Bynd Artisans, which offers personalised and customised leather and paper gifts, it is all about storytelling — including the reasons behind the creation of certain products, said founder and chief executive officer Winnie Chan.
And this brings extra meaning to the product, said the 50-year-old.
“In this era, there's a lot of mass production, and we're all fighting for the customers' dollars. So what makes us different?"" she said. 
“If I tell you a story, you may find it resonates with you, or it is a story you want to share with the person you are buying a gift for. Storytelling is a form of differentiation (for us).”
Like Ginlee Studio, Bynd Artisan also runs a variety of workshops that include coptic bookbinding, basic fine script calligraphy, and an assortment of lessons related to using leather as a material.
A benefit of running workshops, said both Ms Chan and Ms Lee, is that they help introduce the brands to people who may otherwise not have heard of them.
While Ms Gibson the interior designer did not end up becoming a regular customer of Ginlee’s — she chalked it up to personal taste — her friend who attended the bag-making workshop with her did, after falling in love with the label’s designs.
So how have these experiential strategies worked out for these businesses?
While Living Shrimply’s Mr Ng was unable to provide figures, he said sales have “definitely increased” compared to when the store was just operating online.
Zall’s Ms Yan similarly did not provide any figures, though she said that the bookstore has been getting repeat customers, including students whose initial plans were to use the space for studying.
Meanwhile, Ms Lee said that her store has seen its overall revenue increased by around 20 per cent since the label launched its workshop in 2020.
As for Ms Chan, she observed that Bynd Artisan’s retail stores “have a better customer retention rate” of about 50 per cent due to her staff’s efforts in building brand loyalty, compared with their online store.
HOW HAVE EXPERIENTIAL RETAIL MALLS FARED?
While the individual efforts of the four retailers interviewed by TODAY have led to positive business outcomes for them, can the same be said for shopping malls touting experiential concepts?
In Singapore, two malls are known for this — Jewel Changi Airport, which draws in crowds with its iconic architecture and lush indoor gardens, and Funan, which shed its identity as an IT haven and took on a new persona after a S$560 million revamp in 2019.

A 2019 press release from Funan’s landlord, CapitaLand, described the mall as a place for “experiential and activity-based retail” that includes an indoor rock-climbing wall and an indoor cycling path.
CapitaLand also jointly manages Jewel with Changi Airport Group.
Between Funan and Jewel, the experts interviewed had little doubt that it is the latter which is a runaway success and a better example of experiential shopping done right. 
Nevertheless, NUS’ Prof Loh noted the fact that Jewel has the advantage of being located right next to Changi Airport's Terminal 1.
""I’ve told people before, when you arrive in Singapore through Terminal 1, you don’t arrive into a country, you arrive into a shopping mall,"" said Prof Loh, adding that this gives Jewel a constant stream of fresh visitors in the form of tourists. 
""Whereas for Funan, after a while, you have to cater to repeat visitors. So now when you go to Funan, the novelty factor from 2019 has worn off.""
At least one business at Funan said there have been months when its revenue is in the red, while TODAY spotted other stores that have already shuttered.
About half a year after Funan reopened, to much fanfare, Singapore confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in January 2020, and the virus soon spread rapidly, eventually causing more than two years of mayhem for businesses islandwide.
Mr Gary Lin, the deputy director of Temasek Polytechnic’s (TP) School of Business, said the jury is still out on whether Funan will be successful.
“Its (experiential offerings) likely help but whether it justifies the investment is to be determined,” said Mr Lin. “Jewel is likely to be more successful than Funan because of higher concentration of tourists, attractive environment, and the range of food and beverage and wider appeal.”
Retailers at Funan spoke of their contrasting experiences with the mall’s uneven flow of foot traffic.
Mr Halim Wahab, the chief operation officer of home goods store Chokmah, said that about 30 to 40 per cent of his customers come from those walking around the mall, while the rest are online.
However, the same could not be said for an urban gardening enterprise located on the fourth floor.
Mr Ricky Lim, founder of The Green Capsule, said his business has been mostly relying on customers who learn about his terrarium-making workshops online. Only a few are customers who visit the shop. 
“These days, after 7pm, it is really, really very quiet,” said the 39-year-old. “But if you go to the ground floor and the basement, it is too crowded. No one is exploring beyond the second floor.”

Most of the mall’s eateries are located within the basement, along with the entrance to Climb Central’s rock wall, while the second floor features popular brands such as the Love, Bonito fashion label, the ABC Cooking Studio, and the Best Denki electronics store.
At least three shoppers told TODAY that they were not enticed to explore the mall.
Mr Manesh Rangarajan, 33, said he typically just has a meal after his weekly rock climbing session, and rarely walks around the mall afterwards, unless there is something urgent which he needs to buy.
In Ms Erina Yeo’s case, her visits to Funan are mostly incidental since she works nearby and occasionally has her meals there.
Otherwise, the 43-year-old civil servant said there is no reason for her to make a trip to the mall since she can get what she needs at shops closer to home, or online.
As for one 21-year-old, who wanted to be known only as Chloe, it is the mall’s spacious public areas that attract her to it at least once a month — though this is purely for studying.
The student said she would prefer to get her retail products online if she can find a cheaper alternative.
Mr James Ng, the managing director of T K Foto Technic — a camera and audio equipment store on Funan’s third floor — acknowledged that CapitaLand has been trying to attract patrons through events and loyalty reward programmes.
However, he added that ultimately, it is up to each retailer to “put in their own effort” to find an experiential concept that works for them.
In response to TODAY's queries, Mr Steve Ng, CapitaLand's general manager for Funan, Raffles City Singapore and CQ @ Clarke Quay said experiential retail is key to the company's plans to attract and engage shoppers across its malls.
""Since the relaxation of Singapore’s pandemic measures, we have been actively positioning our downtown properties to welcome the return of more shoppers and tourists with experiential lifestyle concepts and vibrant community events,"" he said.

EXPERIENTIAL RETAIL NOT THE PANACEA
While the experiential concept has been touted as the future of retail, it is not necessarily the best way forward for all brick-and-mortar stores, said the experts interviewed.
Suburban malls, for instance, are unlikely to need it as they serve a “utilitarian function”, said Prof Loh.
“Visitors to these malls often want to just buy something fast, head back to where they are staying. Too much of this experiential thing can be pretty annoying,” he said.
However, if the customers are going out of their way to visit a shop, they need to be given a very good reason to do so, said Living Shrimply’s Mr Chean.
For instance, consumer Daniel Tan, 47, said that he would venture from his home in Woodlands and head to town only if a retail outlet offers him something that he is unable to get from the mall closest to his home, Causeway Point.
And whether the experiential concept works or not for a business is also tied to a practical question, said TP’s Mr Lin.
“It is about whether it is worth investing in. Can retailers afford to do it once, and then to continually innovate and transform?” he said. 
For one multi-label fashion boutique owner at Wheelock Place, the answer is no.
Madam Irene Lee, the owner of Lafont, said that it is not only a challenge for her to digitalise her operations, but she also lacks the expertise to pivot her business model.
The 53-year-old, who runs the shop with one other employee, said: “For retailers like us, we hardly have the time also. When you’re in the mall, you start work at 11am and close at 9pm. Then there is the issue of manpower. All these are costs.”
But given how quiet her side of the mall is, Mdm Lee said there have been months where she has not been able to cover her monthly overheads, which can amount to more than S$10,000.
Still she enjoys the patronage of a regular pool of customers, who have become friends over the years.
“Sometimes they’ll drop by for coffee, and maybe I have something new to offer which they buy. Other times I just offer to alter their clothes, which is an extra service,” said Mdm Lee. 
And it would seem that Mdm Lee is offering a form of experiential shopping —  without even realising it.
Providing customers with a memorable experience does not always have to be grandiose. Sometimes, it is just about providing a personal touch. 
“Your experiential event could be something as small as inviting your known clients for a glass of wine after shopping hours and then putting it on Instagram,” said du Boulay Contracts’ Ms Talathi-Lamb. 
“It is still a positive experience, and it shows that you've treated the people who shop with you and buy from you in a special way and that goes a long way.""
She added: ""So, it doesn't have to be a big event, it can be something small but engaging and that can make a big difference to how your customers and clients perceive you.”

SFA reviews 16 insect species for human consumption; seeks feedback on import conditions,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sfa-review-16-insect-species-human-consumption-animal-feed-feedback-import-conditions-pre-licensing-requirements-3010291,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) may soon allow the import and sale of insects and insect products for human consumption and animal feed.
In a statement on Sunday (Oct 16), the SFA said that after a ""thorough scientific review"", it could allow ""specific species of insects with a history of human consumption"" to be served as food. 
Sixteen insect species have been reviewed for human consumption, including some types of crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, mealworms, moths, silkworms and honey bees.  
The commercial farming of insects for human consumption and animal feed has been promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation in recent years, the SFA said. 
In Singapore, more than 10 companies have expressed interest in importing insect food products or insect farming, it added. 
Companies intending to import or farm insects for human consumption or animal feed have to meet certain requirements for food safety, SFA said. 
These include providing documentary proof that the imported insects were farmed in ""regulated establishments with food safety controls"" and that no pathogens or harmful contaminants were used in the rearing or feeding of the insects. 
Those who want to import or farm insects without a history of human consumption must conduct and submit safety assessments to SFA before the product is allowed for sale. 
SFA said insect products will be subjected to food and safety testing, as with all other food available in Singapore. ""Food that is found to be non-compliant with our food and safety regulations will not be allowed for sale,"" SFA said. 
The agency is seeking feedback from the public as well as from the food and animal feed industry on the import conditions and additional pre-licensing requirements for insects and insect products. 
The public consultation will end on Dec 4.

'I let my guard down': Scammers targeting small business owners with Instagram takeover trick,"Scammers are duping small business owners into sending the password reset link to their Instagram page under the guise of confirming their identity.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/instagram-scam-hack-small-business-password-reset-2999176,"SINGAPORE: Small business owner Dayana Rizal, 27, is no stranger to dealing with online buyers, but the one she encountered on Oct 3 seemed particularly - in her words - ""harmless"".
Ms Dayana, who sold clay mugs on her now-defunct Instagram page potekceramics, said the buyer was a sweet talker who seemed clueless about how to purchase her mugs online.
The buyer, using a private Instagram account with a few hundred followers, sent Ms Dayana a direct message with a screenshot of her wares, saying: ""I want to buy this.""
""There were multiple items inside (the screenshot), so in my head I was thinking like, there are so many (products) inside - which one do you want to buy?"" Ms Dayana told CNA, recalling her exchange with the buyer during some lull time at work.
""So I just assumed it was like a clueless makcik or aunty who was blur and didn't know how to order through Instagram. I think I let my guard down also because the person behind the account was calling me 'dear' and all that.""

Ms Dayana, who works in a pottery studio and conducts workshops, then referred the buyer to her website, asking them to check what was available and complete the purchase there. But the buyer insisted on buying through Instagram.
""I guess she really doesn't know how to use the computer,"" Ms Dayana remembered thinking then, laughing at her own naivete. ""I sound so stupid now that I'm recounting it.
""I was honestly trying to close the sale because it's always exciting when someone wants to buy your stuff,"" she added. ""But also I wanted to help her; not everyone knows how to use a website.""
Ms Dayana relented, telling the buyer they could send the money to her mobile number. The buyer then asked how much it would cost to deliver to Yishun, so Ms Dayana replied that it was a S$5 delivery fee islandwide.
The buyer's next question, however, led to the first red flag.
The buyer asked if she was the owner or admin of the potekceramics Instagram page, ostensibly to verify that they were dealing with the business owner. Ms Dayana confirmed that she owned the business.
""She was like, okay, just to make sure, I'll send in a request to Instagram to send you a message just to check whether you're the real owner or not. Once you receive the message, can you send me a screenshot? Then I'll make the PayNow to your number,"" she said.
What Ms Dayana did not realise was that the buyer was actually using Instagram's password reset function to take over her account.
Ms Dayana then got a text message from Facebook with a link to reset her Instagram password. Without ""thinking"" or scrutinising the message, she took a screenshot of it and forwarded it to the buyer.
""I didn't look at it carefully. I thought it was just like a message from Facebook to verify that I'm the real owner,"" she said, admitting that the official nature of the message threw her off, and that it was so quick and easy to take a screenshot of a message and pass it on.
""I was really clouded by, one, I wanted to close the sale. Secondly, I just thought she was a harmless aunty. I thought she didn't want to be scammed, and I understood also because I didn't want to be scammed.
""But in the end, I also got scammed.""
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TARGETED
Other small business owners have encountered buyers who try to use this seemingly simple method of taking over an Instagram account.
On Sep 21, the owner of handmade jewellery business Ellaie took to TikTok to recount how she was almost deceived by the same ruse, saying in a video that the buyer who tried it was very ""unassuming"".
A Straits Times report on Oct 2 also detailed how a man who sold kueh lapis on Instagram fell victim to the method, losing access to his account and a large number of his 5,000 followers, some of them loyal customers.















After Ms Dayana sent the buyer the screenshot of the message, they said thanks and she did not think much about it. But less than an hour later, when she opened her Instagram app, a pop-up said she had been logged out.
Ms Dayana went back to that official message Facebook had sent, and realised that it was a link to reset her password. She tried the link but it did not work.
She then tried using her username and phone number to sign in to her page, but the app said the username and number did not exist. She realised that she had lost all access to her Instagram page.
Ms Dayana was panicking at this point, especially as the person who took over her page had blocked her personal account from viewing it too.






      Ms Dayana Rizal was not able to recover access to her Instagram page. (Photo: Dayana Rizal)
    






She tried using Instagram's account recovery function, which asked her to send a video selfie to confirm her identity. Instagram emailed her on the same day saying it could not identify her, asking her to submit another video. She has not done so and has not received any word from Instagram since.
Ms Dayana said she got frustrated.
""I shouldn't have to put in so much effort to try and get back my account. I kind of want Instagram to take down the account,"" she said, adding that she plans to reach out to Instagram and browse Reddit for tips.
A quick check by CNA on Oct 13 confirmed that the potekceramics page - now with a slightly modified page name - remains online, although the scam posts have been deleted.
In response to queries from CNA, Instagram's parent company Meta said it is committed to safeguarding the integrity of its services and protecting its community from hackers, scams and other inauthentic behaviour.
""Online phishing techniques are not unique to Meta, and we will never request your password via email or direct messages. Any official correspondence from Meta on people’s accounts can be accessed via the support requests to help verify authenticity,"" a spokesperson said.
""We strongly encourage our community to be aware of phishing scams and turn on two-factor authentication in their settings to protect their account.""
SCAM POSTS
Ms Dayana's friends sent her updates about her page, saying that the new owner was posting investment-related scams and sending direct messages to her followers about it.
Some of the scam posts were plastered on a picture of Ms Dayana and her boyfriend, which she believes was downloaded off her highlights reel. She found this ""creepy"".
Ms Dayana's friends reported the account to Instagram and blocked it in hopes of flagging it as being hacked. Some of them also messaged the new owner, telling them to give it up.
The new owner was brazen in their response, Ms Dayana said, adding that they ""liked"" the angry messages and told her friends to stop wasting their time.
""It just felt like a bit more targeted and quite personal,"" she said. ""Not like a random robot that's trying to scam you.""






      Ms Dayana Rizal's friends tried to convince the scammer to return her account. (Photo: Dayana Rizal)
    






One friend said that one creator she follows had also been approached with the same tactics by the same buyer on the same day that Ms Dayana was fooled.
Ms Dayana said she was not worried about losing customers, highlighting that her pottery friends with large followings had posted about the incident and pointed her followers to her new Instagram page, potekceramic.
Her old page, started in early 2021, had about 600 followers.
""I didn't want my brand to be associated with this kind of scam, so that's why I didn't really bother trying to recover that account. Because to me, it's already tainted. So, I already created a new account just to start afresh,"" she said.
""I'm not that worried about losing followers because I know that those who really care about my brand and the work that I make will find me one way or another.""
""JUST BE A BIT MORE PRESENT""
Ms Dayana said she is considering making a police report but acknowledged that she has got over the frustration of losing her account. She said she is telling her story so others do not fall for the same trap.
""You know, life is more than just Instagram, so I've been busy like actually working,"" she said.
Ms Dayana said the incident has left her wary of doing business through direct messages on Instagram, adding that she recently removed a ""weird"" follower and blocked them out of caution.
She advised small business owners who deal over Instagram to really look into a buyer's account and be vigilant of what they are asking for.
""Don't get so into the moment when you want to make a sale. Just be a bit more present,"" she said, adding that she felt ""greedy"" at the point of getting tricked.
""Even if the message is from Facebook, I think other people should read carefully about what the message is telling them to do."""
Eye colour variation in primates partly due to lighting differences in habitats: NUS study,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/primate-eye-colour-variation-habitat-lighting-sexual-selection-nus-study-3009471,"SINGAPORE: Why do some people have lighter eyes than others?
Differences in iris colouration have traditionally been explained as a result of sexual selection. However, a recent study led by National University of Singapore (NUS) researchers has helped to uncover another important factor. 
Findings published in Scientific Reports on Saturday (Oct 15) showed that variation in iris colouration is partly due to differences in lighting in the habitats of primate species.
Researchers from NUS' Department of Biological Sciences together with collaborators from Republic Polytechnic, the University of St Andrews and Leiden University, have discovered that ambient light is an important factor in determining eye colour across primate species.
The research team collected hundreds of photographs from 77 primate species and measured the brightness and colour of different parts of their eyes, NUS said in a press release. 
""What is exciting about this research is that by using the comparative method in evolutionary biology, we find that many species of primates independently evolved bluer eyes at higher latitudes, just like what happened within our own species,"" said Professor Antonia Monteiro from NUS' Department of Biological Sciences.
The researchers found that species living farther from the equator tend to have lighter conjunctiva, known as the tissue surrounding the iris, not unlike skin pigmentation in humans. 
""Iris colour also shifted to become greener or bluer, as populations were found farther away from the equator, where irises tend to be browner,"" said NUS in the press release. 
Most previous studies addressing diversity in iris colour in humans revolved around the idea that colour was sexually selected, said NUS. 
This was also the preferred explanation for diversity in skin pigmentation until evidence tipped the balance towards protection from UV rays.
""Seeing that differences in eye colour could be explained by changes in lighting typical of the natural ranges of primate species suggests that iris colour may have been selected by environmental conditions in humans, similar to skin pigmentation,"" NUS said.
Although this study provides a possible solution to the puzzle of iris colour variation, many mysteries remain, said postdoctoral researcher Dr Juan O Perea-Garcia. 
More research is needed to understand why some species living in the equator sometimes have striking blue eyes, like the brown spider monkey, or why some species with similar ranges have different levels of conjunctival pigmentation, like the chimpanzee and bonobo.

Lasting Power of Attorney applications to be made online from Nov 14,"The online Lasting Power of Attorney application will be digitally signed via Singpass. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lasting-power-attorney-online-portal-nov-14-singpass-digital-msf-3009421,"SINGAPORE: The application process for Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) will go digital from Nov 14 with the launch of an online portal. 
The new Office of the Public Guardian Online system will offer applicants greater ease, convenience, and security, announced the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) on Saturday (Oct 15).
All applications will be made online instead of using the current hardcopy form, and digitally signed via Singpass, said the ministry, adding that hardcopies may still be accepted in exceptional situations subject to the Public Guardian's approval.
The digitised application process follows amendments to the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) which was passed in Parliament in July 2021. 
An LPA allows an appointed person to make medical and financial decisions on another person's behalf should they lose mental capacity.
The upcoming portal will use MyInfo to pre-fill the LPA form with verified personal particulars, with the user's consent. 
The processing and registration time for LPAs will also be halved from three weeks to one-and-a-half weeks, excluding the mandatory three-week waiting period, said MSF. 
Donors and donees, including those who registered their LPAs before the launch, will be able to view their LPAs in the portal. Donors may also share their online LPA with trusted individuals.
""After the donor has lost mental capacity, donees may share the online LPA with third-party agencies to facilitate transactions on behalf of the donor,"" said MSF.
All hardcopy LPAs registered prior to the launch of the system remain valid but will be converted to electronic versions. 
Donors and donees will be notified to verify the accuracy of the online LPAs and will be given 90 days from the date of notification to do so, added the ministry.
Hardcopy LPAs certified prior to the launch of the portal can still be submitted within six months from the date of the donor's signature on the form.

DATA PROTECTION MEASURES
MSF said that it has put in place data protection measures to prevent data loss or theft, unauthorised access as well as undue disclosure.
All personal information in the system is stored and secured on government servers, in compliance with the Government’s data security and data protection measures, it said.
Real-time notifications will also be sent via SMS or email to all parties throughout the LPA-making process, providing instant status updates and confirmation of actions taken by all parties.
The Office of the Public Guardian has also retained the requirement for donors to meet certificate issuers in-person for LPA certification.
This requirement serves as a safeguard for certificate issuers to ensure that the donor understands the LPA made and is not induced by fraud or undue pressure to make one, said MSF.
""The use of Singpass digital signing further eliminates risk of forgery of signatures and prevents tampering and alteration of the digital LPA,"" added the ministry. 
The online application service as well as instructional videos will be in English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil.
Members of the public who require assistance with the application process can approach CitizenConnect Centres at selected community clubs and ServiceSG Centres.
Those with queries about the portal and the LPA application process may visit the MSF website or call its hotline at 1800 111 2222."

"Singapore does not rule out reimposing mask mandate, closely monitoring XBB wave: Ong Ye Kung",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-xbb-safe-management-measures-mask-ong-ye-kung-3009186,"SINGAPORE: Singapore does not rule out bringing back some COVID-19 restrictions, but it will try its ""very best"" not to disrupt the normal lives of people, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Saturday (Oct 15).
Giving an update on the latest COVID-19 wave of XBB infections, Mr Ong said at a Ministry of Health (MOH) press conference that the number of cases is rising, driven by the new Omicron strain and by reinfections.
The ministry is closely monitoring the situation, and it does not rule out reimposing safe management measures (SMM) such as mask-wearing, but he pointed out that the country is now riding out yet another wave without these measures.
""We have never declared that COVID is an endemic disease, some countries have. We have never declared that it's no longer a social health threat, some countries have. We much prefer to let action and our lives speak for itself,"" said Mr Ong.
""And what we have done is that with every successive wave that we have gone through, we relax the safe distancing, safe measurement measures ... to the extent that now almost everything has been dismantled.
""So for all, in reality, having done all that, in effect, we are living with COVID like it is an endemic disease ... look at where we are now - we're going through a wave without SMM.""
Mr Ong said that Singapore will try its ""very, very best"" never to go back to the days of ""circuit breaker"", ""heightened alert"" or ""anything that severely disrupt our normal lives"".
Mr Ong urged people to take personal responsibility and take necessary precautions, amid the current rise in cases.

""Test yourself, isolate yourself when you're not feeling well, wear your mask if you don't feel well or if you're living with the elderly, to protect the elderly, wear your mask,"" he said. ""If you're infected, Protocol 1, 2, 3 is still relevant.""
Another precaution that hospitals have taken is to restrict visitors, he said. During the press conference on Saturday morning, Mr Ong and Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said that hospital capacity is being ramped up, and should be able to cope with the current wave.
Mr Ong also reminded people to go for vaccinations if they are eligible. He said that on Friday, Singapore started administering bivalent vaccine jabs, and completed about 4,200 vaccinations.
""If you're above 50 and have not received your three shots or if you're above 50, and your last shot is more than five months ago, consider walking into a joint testing and vaccination centre to receive your Moderna bivalent vaccine,"" he said.
""I've gotten mine ... this time round - hardly any side effects at all.""
These are the measures that the Government has in place now, and if the situation should worsen, there could be more measures ""in a way that doesn't disrupt our lives"".
""I think the obvious one is number one, maybe we put back our masks, say indoor or indoor and outdoor, if the situation requires it,"" he said.
Another possibility is the return of vaccine-differentiated measures, Mr Ong added.
All such measures, like the requirement for one to be vaccinated in order to dine in at hawker centres and other food establishments, were lifted on Oct 10.
""We are monitoring the XBB rate closely and the impact on the healthcare system to see if some of these measures are necessary. As of now, no decision has to be taken.""

Commentary: Is Singapore ready for another COVID-19 wave?



















Commentary: Mask-wearing now goes beyond just protecting against COVID-19"
‘Short and sharp’: COVID-19 wave of XBB infections in Singapore likely to peak in mid-November,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-xbb-wave-peak-mid-november-3009141,"SINGAPORE: The current wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the XBB strain, will likely peak by around mid-November, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Saturday (Oct 15).
“This is likely to be a short and sharp wave,” said Mr Ong, saying that Singapore is likely to see about 15,000 daily cases on average. ""By around mid-November, we should see the wave subsiding.""
He added that on certain days when more cases tend to be reported, such as on Tuesdays, the caseload could reach 20,000 or 25,000.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that using the BA.5 wave as an indication, hospitalised cases peaked at 800 in July, and hospitals in Singapore, while stretched, were able to cope.
The proportion of cases with the XBB strain, an Omicron subvariant, has been on the rise in Singapore over the past month. While highly transmissible, it has not caused more severe disease than previous variants thus far.
On Oct 14, there were 9,087 new COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore and nine were in ICU. A total of 562 patients were hospitalised, with 44 requiring oxygen. The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.64.











Referring to the chart above showing the 7-day moving average number of cases, Mr Ong said: ""We're still seeing cases rising, but it has started to turn down which means cases are not accelerating.""
In Singapore, XBB is now the predominant subvariant, accounting for 54 per cent of local cases from Oct 3 to 9. It was first detected in August in India and has since been detected in more than 17 countries, including Australia, Bangladesh, Denmark, Japan and the US, said MOH.
The current wave is largely driven by the XBB strain, and reinfections are also contributing to the wave, Mr Ong said. He pointed out that within three weeks, XBB is ""outcompeting"" the other Omicron subvariants. 

















""Because 75 per cent of our population has already been infected, so any new wave has to be a reinfection, contributed by infection. That's what we are seeing now,"" he said.
The proportion of reinfections among total COVID-19 cases in Singapore has been increasing over the past month, with reinfections currently making up about 17 per cent of total new cases.
Mr Ong explained that while people may get reinfected soon after one bout of COVID-19, that is rare. The chance of getting COVID-19 again for one to three months after one infection is much lower than if one has never got the disease. But this resistance wanes over time.
""People who got infected last October or earlier ... your risk of being infected is almost the same as a COVID-naive person. So that's what also driving infection.""

CNA Explains: What you need to know about the XBB COVID-19 variant













MORE HOSPITAL BEDS FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS
Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said that while the number of coronavirus cases is rising, the number of severe cases and hospitalisations is not as high as in previous waves.
There are sufficient ICU beds for both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients, and there are slightly more than 50 adult ICU beds for COVID-19 cases, he added.
MOH said that in response to the surge over the past two weeks, public hospitals have rapidly activated various measures to operate about 200 more beds for COVID-19 patients.
These include deferring non-urgent admissions, discharging stable patients home or to nursing homes and transferring recovering patients to transitional care facilities and community hospitals.
""The number of COVID cases in our ICUs are slowly rising in tandem, as the community cases have increased, albeit at a lower trajectory,"" he said.
""I seek the understanding that our public hospitals have to prioritise their resources to cater for those who are more seriously ill.""
In the coming two weeks, public hospitals will ramp up bed capacity for COVID-19 patients, and this is being done in stages - until 800 beds - by early November. Dr Mak added that members of the public are encouraged to only go to the emergency department for emergency conditions. 
""At this point in time, we're still able to handle the increased attendances that we've seen in emergency departments. But we are mindful that we need to continue to preserve that capacity,"" said Dr Mak.
BIVALENT VACCINE
Mr Ong urged people in Singapore to exercise personal responsibility, reminding the public to monitor their health and to go for vaccinations if eligible.
As of Friday - when the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine was rolled out - more than 4,000 people have received the jab, said MOH.
The vaccine is currently available to those who have yet to achieve maximum protection, or those aged 50 years and above who have received their last vaccine dose more than five months ago. 
To questions on when bivalent vaccines will be made available to people younger than 50, Mr Ong said that ""supplies are coming in"", and the Government is recommending vaccination for older people first as they are at higher risk of getting severe disease.
""As supplies come in, our intention is to extend it further (to those who are younger),"" said Mr Ong.
""Having said that, I should say that - get your minimum protection, meaning three mRNA doses; our data shows that your vaccination and your protection against severe illness -  if you're a young person - it's still quite strong.""

Home recovery under Protocol 2 will be the default for COVID-positive infants and pregnant women ,"The risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups is low, says the Ministry of Health. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/home-recovery-protocol-2-pregnant-infants-oct-25-3009161,"SINGAPORE: Pregnant women and infants aged three months to below one year old who test positive for COVID-19 will be able to recover by themselves at home under Protocol 2 from Oct 25.
This is because the risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups is low, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Oct 15).
""In view of the low risk, patients from these two groups can be managed as Protocol 2 by default, for self-recovery at home or under the care of their own primary doctors,"" said the ministry. 
Currently, COVID-19 patients aged between three months and one year old, as well as women who are less than 36 weeks pregnant, follow Protocol 1 where MOH will check on their recovery.
Higher-risk individuals under Protocol 1 are also required to do both an antigen rapid test (ART) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
Patients from these two groups will either be placed on the home recovery programme by default, or if their home environment is not suitable, they will be taken to a care facility.
Most of Singapore's new COVID-19 infections are Protocol 2 cases, which are those who are well or assessed to have a mild condition.
In shifting these two groups to Protocol 2, which allows for self-recovery, MOH said these patients should continue to monitor themselves closely for signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or a persistent fever of above 38 degree Celsius while recovering at home.
""If signs and symptoms worsen, they should seek medical attention,"" the ministry said.
Speaking at a press conference held by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said the change in health protocols for these two groups is part of its regular review of the risk of severe infections for more vulnerable people.
“There is a benefit for us because that means it reduces the number of admissions and people needing to stay in hospital,” said Associate Professsor Mak.
“Surely it's more pleasant to keep children in homes with their parents rather than being in the hospital in a very strange environment which they are very frightened of.""

CNA Explains: What you need to know about the XBB COVID-19 variant













EMPLOYERS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE MCs
To relieve the load on general practitioner clinics and polyclinics, MOH reminded employers not to require medical certificates from employees who have either self-tested positive for COVID-19 or have symptoms of acute respiratory infection.
This is to avoid patients with mild or no symptoms making unnecessary visits to GP clinics, which would compromise the standard of care for other patients who require medical attention, the ministry said.
MOH added that those who are well should be allowed to work from home if they are able to do so, and encouraged those with mild flu-like symptoms to consider teleconsultation with their doctors.
There has been a rise in COVID-19 cases in Singapore, driven by the XBB Omicron variant which may be driving an increase in reinfections. 
The proportion of reinfections has been increasing over the past month, with reinfections currently making up about 17 per cent of total new cases, MOH said on Saturday.
""Given that immunity from natural infection in the population is likely waning over time, this underscores the importance of ensuring minimum protection from vaccination and keeping our vaccinations up to date to protect us against severe infections,"" the ministry added.
The current COVID-19 wave will likely peak by around mid-November, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.

"IN FOCUS: 4-day week in Singapore – some workers want it, but are businesses ready?","Some employees are understandably excited at talk of a four-day work week - but will it ever materialise, and at what cost?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/4-day-work-week-singapore-employees-business-life-balance-3007396,"SINGAPORE: Working long hours in the finance industry, Ms Jas Chua fell sick periodically due to the constant stress she was under.
She pushed herself for up to 12 hours, five days a week, and would check her emails even on weekends as “work never finishes”. This led to burnout every so often, and she would then take weeks to recover.
“When you reach that burnt-out stage, it's very hard to recover … You're really far from your usual 100 per cent,” she said.
She would work at “70 to 75 per cent” for weeks before getting back to speed, then the cycle repeated itself.
The 31-year-old quit her bank job last year, after co-founding an e-commerce company, and she started giving her employees a four-day work week from July this year.
Lazywaist Co, which sells shapewear, hires seven employees and they usually have Wednesdays off on top of Saturday and Sunday. This does not apply on weeks with public holidays, and the start-up offers only 10 days of annual leave, she clarified.
Even so, the four-day week has made staff more motivated and helped her attract more job seekers, Ms Chua said.
“We’ve become a very output-driven company, instead of focusing on the process of sitting there, nine to six,” she said.
“I feel that the quality of work actually improved … the staff are more willing to go the extra mile to finish up the work that they have.”
She’s also noticed that she now has twice the usual number of applicants for job openings, and there is a bigger pool of higher calibre candidates who apply because of the flexible work arrangement.
“I definitely had trouble hiring as a small start-up at first, this has made it easier,” said Ms Chua.
IDEA IN THE SPOTLIGHT
In Singapore, a parliamentary question on Sep 13 about the four-day week was widely shared and discussed. Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang had said that employers and workers should adopt a ""flexible mindset"" on a four-day work week.
""A four-day work week is one of many types of flexible work arrangements, and the ministry, together with our tripartite partners, strongly encourages employers and employees to be open to flexible work arrangements in all its various forms to identify and adopt those that best suit their unique business needs and their workers' needs,"" Ms Gan had said.
She said that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) was not aware of any ongoing studies in Singapore, and added that reports of four-day work week pilots implemented in other countries appeared mixed.
Ms Gan also said that stakeholders have concerns about how such a move would impact business costs, productivity and employee well-being. She added that a four-day work week may work well for some employers and employees but not others.

Meanwhile, the conversation on this has picked up around the world. Last month, the BBC reported that many British firms taking part in a four-day working week trial have said that they are likely to make the scheme permanent after a six-month pilot ends.
Of the 73 companies in the trial, 41 firms responded to a survey midway through the scheme. Around 86 per cent of them said they are likely to keep the four-day week after the trial ends.
Such trials, initiated by non-profit organisation 4 Day Week Global, are currently running in several territories including the UK, North America, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.
Ms Charlotte Lockhart, founder and managing director of 4 Day Week Global, told CNA that they are continuing to start programmes in other countries, such as South Africa and Brazil, and are turning their attention to Asia.
They’re looking to start a coalition of interested parties in Singapore to advocate for the four-day week here, and have set their sights on South Korea next.
81% WANT 4-DAY WEEK
Workers in Singapore seem keen to transit to a shorter work week.
In a survey of 1,000 workers here, 81 per cent said that they want a four-day work week, and 37 per cent said they want it “very much”. 











The majority (78 per cent) of those who want the four-day week see having greater work-life balance as a key benefit. 
A significant proportion (47 per cent) felt that the policy was “less likely to cause burnout"". More than a third of the respondents (35 per cent) said that they had experienced burnout at work in the last 12 months, in the survey conducted by Milieu Insight from Sep 20 to 22.
Respondents also thought it would result in “lower operational costs for work offices” (43 per cent) and would increase productivity (42 per cent).
But they also had concerns, the topmost being that they’d still have to reply to urgent work emails or requests on their days off (65 per cent). 
Many (59 per cent) were also worried about possible salary cuts and longer work days (56 per cent), should the work week be shorter. Among those surveyed, 80 per cent did not think that a four-day work week warrants a wage cut. 
But despite the popularity among workers, more than half of the respondents (55 per cent) thought that their companies were not ready to make the switch.
FEW COMPANIES OFFER 4-DAY WEEK
Currently, there are few companies in Singapore that offer this approach. Based on data from JobStreet, less than 1 per cent of the jobs on the hiring platform offer four-day work weeks.
Ms Chew Siew Mee, managing director of JobStreet by SEEK, observed that jobs with four-day weeks are mostly entry-level roles, primarily in the sales and service sectors.
A sampling of online job ads offering four-day weeks include positions for retail assistants, hotel housekeepers, baggage handlers and F&B service or kitchen crew.
Employers are using the four-day work week arrangement to attract candidates to roles that require shift work, Ms Chew said. But she saw “no obvious downside” in salary offered for jobs with a four-day work week compared with those lasting a day longer.











“This mode of working in Singapore is a relatively new working arrangement and we can expect that it will take some time before it is adopted more widely,” she said.
While few and far between, there is one company with a presence in Singapore that offers a four-day week option.
PropertyGuru gives employees the option of “compressed work weeks”, where they can fit their full week of 40 working hours into four days a week or nine days a fortnight, with no change in pay.
“The challenges posed by the pandemic gave us an opportunity to relook at our ways of working – and ensure that PropertyGuru adopts dynamically to a new way of working,” said Ms Genevieve Godwin, the group’s chief people officer. 
Besides a compressed week and hybrid work arrangements, the company also offers workers part-time work and other schemes as part of their “Future of Work” programme. 
These new work arrangements have been rolled out in Singapore and Malaysia and will be implemented in other markets to all 1,600 employees in time, she said.
“NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE FIRST MOVER”
HR consultants told CNA that not many firms are making the first move on this.
Ms Agnes Yee, head of interim solutions at Kerry Consulting, said that the change will happen at a “snail’s pace”, citing how the civil service in Singapore only switched to a five-day work week in 2004.
Before, many employers in Singapore worked a five-and-a-half-day week, or had workers come in on alternate Saturdays. Even now, a six-day or five-and-a-half-day week is the norm for some industries.
Although the pandemic has accelerated changes in working culture, she thinks that Asian-headquartered companies are still “struggling” with a hybrid work model, with even less bandwidth to think about a four-day work week.
“I think it will happen, partially, it will happen at a snail's pace,” she said. “We are waiting for someone to do it first, we are always a bit cautious if we are the first movers.”











Ms Candy Choong, vice-president at Levin Group, the parent group of tech recruiter Storm2, said that companies in the technology sector are not moving in that direction either.
It is likely because most of the tech companies are scaling up and are a lot more cautious with financial resources, she said.
“It is very much a ‘wait-and-watch” approach … there hasn’t been economic proof that it will help to drive productivity and revenue. There is no clear first-mover advantage for companies to jump on the bandwagon,” said Ms Choong.
However, more companies are adopting a hybrid work arrangement and some tech companies, especially the smaller ones, allow their employees to take “workcations”.
Workers too ask for such arrangements, with eight out of 10 asking if the prospective employer allows them to work from home.
OTHER FLEXIBLE ARRANGEMENTS
JobStreet’s Ms Chew said that besides a four-day week, there are many ways that companies can explore to provide flexible working arrangements for their workforce. 
For example, they can adopt a hybrid working arrangement, or they can give workers time-off to pick up new skills or engage in wellness activities that improves work-life balance.
More varied leave schemes, such as well-being days for employees to recharge, birthday leave and unlimited annual leave, have been rolled out at more companies post-pandemic.

Microsoft Singapore, for example, has “no-meeting” Monday mornings, so employees don’t have to prepare for meetings on Sundays. In addition, there are “ME-days”, which occur one Friday a month. These are days that people can use to learn something new, spend time with family, or attend classes.
The company also offers employees five well-being days and three volunteer days on top of annual leave. 
Ms Lynn Dang, human resource lead at Microsoft Singapore, said that the tech firm has a culture of “extreme flexibility”.
“It’s all about listening to the needs of our employees and creating a work culture that works for them,” she said.
Another tech firm Salesforce now has a Flex Team policy so that teams can decide when, where, and how they’ll work based on their needs and projects. 
""While there is strong interest in a four-day work week in Singapore, there are also employees who would rather work whenever they want over a five-day week rather than have fixed hours over four work days,"" said Ms Cecily Ng, senior vice president & general manager of Salesforce Singapore and Taiwan.
""Imposing a one-size-fits-all model is not an effective way to engage employees and could very well create the opposite outcome.""











One social enterprise that already has flexible work arrangements and unlimited paid leave is looking to implement a four-day week - perhaps as soon as next year.    
Saturday Kids, a coding and curiosity school for children, had advertised for a role in curriculum development with a four-day work week. General manager Chew Jing Kai said that they have yet to fill the full-time role.
But the school had wanted to experiment with a four-day week with this role and to eventually roll it out to all their employees.
One of the reasons was that, as a school, they want to encourage creativity in the children and their staff, and he felt that they should be out there “experiencing the real world”. But there are kinks to be worked out, said Mr Chew.
“By shifting people to a four-day week and not reducing remuneration, how do you justify that will lead to better results?” he said. 
“Operationally, if you have a business that has to run seven days a week … cutting short the working hours of employees or one day makes it difficult for classroom management.”
There’s also the issue of making sure there’s enough overlap in working times so that people have time for collaboration, he added.
Mr David Blasco, general manager at Randstad Singapore said that a 4-day work week policy shows employees that the business cares about them enough to make significant changes to how the business operates, and is a “very powerful strategy” to attract talent.
But there are some complexities when it comes to putting it into practice. There will be financial costs, especially for sectors that are labour-intensive, said Mr Blasco.
Giving examples, he said: “A hospital or logistics company will always need someone on the job to maintain their productivity levels. Introducing a four-day work week means that they will need to hire more headcount to fill in the shifts, which would ultimately lead to higher costs.” 
He also foresees potential culture clashes. “There will always be some people in the company who prefer to work five days a week because of differences in how they view work and life priorities,” he said.
“THE ONLY WAY … IS TO RUN PILOTS”
These are issues that many companies now in four-day week pilots around the world are grappling with.
Ms Lockhart said that, from her experience, workers themselves some up with productivity solutions once they are motivated to do so - as working faster now also means working less.
“What we find is when you say to people, look, we want to improve productivity and the time that we save, you can have off - then people go oh, okay, how about I tell you about this problem with the business?” she said.
For office work, it’s often a matter of “sorting out meeting behaviour”, while a bit more thinking may need to go into cutting the hours of jobs in manufacturing, hospitality or medicine, she added.
Strongly advocating the adoption of the four-day week, she said that there can be productivity gains, and macroeconomic and societal gains as well.
With less time spent at work, people will have more time to exercise, cook healthier meals, take care of their loved ones or do volunteer work - all of which have a positive impact on one’s physical and mental health and for building community. 
“What we're talking about is how do we rebalance our society?” she said. “As business leaders, we need to remember that we borrow our people from their lives.”
“If you want to understand how four days a week will work, the only way to do it realistically is to run pilots and see how it works specifically for Singapore, find out what are the Singaporean nuances,” she said."
"MCI shortens permit of Vogue Singapore for nudity, content promoting 'non-traditional families'",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vogue-singapore-stern-warning-shortened-permit-mci-3008346,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) issued Vogue Singapore a stern warning, and shortened its permit from one year to six months for breaching content guidelines, it said on Friday (Oct 14).
According to the press release, Vogue Singapore breached the content guidelines for local lifestyle magazines on four occasions within the past two years, for nudity and content that promoted non-traditional families.
During the period of Vogue Singapore’s breaches, the content guidelines have remained the same, said MCI, adding that Vogue Singapore is required to comply with the content guidelines as part of its permit conditions, which includes not undermining prevailing social norms.
""As a matter of process, Vogue Singapore’s current one-year permit has been revoked with effect from Oct 13, 2022,"" it added.
""Vogue Singapore has re-applied and MCI has since issued Vogue Singapore a six-month permit.""
An MCI spokesperson told CNA that the last time a permit was shortened was when action was taken against local arts magazine Art Republik in 2014 for two severe breaches of the content guidelines for ""religiously insensitive/ denigrative content"".
Earlier cases include Cleo, which was placed on shorter permit in 2008, and Singapore FHM, which was placed on shorter permit in 1998. Both magazines made repeated breaches pertaining to content on sex, nudity and the promotion of promiscuity and permissive lifestyle, said the spokesperson.

SFA orders recall of eggs from Malaysian farm due to presence of Salmonella bacteria,"The affected eggs imported from Teo Seng Layer Farm 1 can be identified by the stamp CEJ027 on them.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-food-agency-eggs-recall-malaysia-farm-salmonella-enteritidis-bacteria-3008291,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) ordered the recall of eggs imported from Teo Seng Layer Farm 1 in Malaysia after detecting the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis, it said in a media release on Friday (Oct 14).
The affected eggs can be identified by the stamp CEJ027 on them, said SFA.
Salmonella Enteritidis may cause foodborne illness if food is consumed raw or undercooked.
SFA directed all six importers to withhold or recall the affected eggs.
In particular, BH Fresh Food was directed to recall the affected eggs that had been distributed to retail outlets for sale as a precautionary measure, said SFA, adding that the other five importers were also told to withhold the affected eggs from distribution.
Only eggs with farm code CEJ027 are implicated in this recall. Other eggs imported by BH Fresh Food are not affected, said SFA.
The recall is ongoing. 
SFA said Teo Seng Layer Farm 1 is also suspended and will not be allowed to export its eggs to Singapore until the farm has rectified the contamination issue.
As Salmonella Enteritidis can be destroyed by heat, the eggs are safe to consume if they are cooked thoroughly.
Salmonella Enteritidis can survive in raw and undercooked eggs and may cause foodborne illness. Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting.
While the infection typically subsides within a week in most people, Salmonella Enteritidis can cause serious infection in the vulnerable such as the elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems.
SFA advised consumers who have purchased the affected eggs to cook them thoroughly before consumption. Those who have consumed the eggs and are unwell should seek medical attention."
"Former GIC economist, TOC issued POFMA correction direction over false statements about HDB’s deficits",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pofma-direction-hdb-ang-mo-kio-deficits-past-reserves-yeoh-lam-keong-toc-3008241,"SINGAPORE: A correction direction has been issued to alternative news website The Online Citizen (TOC) and Mr Yeoh Lam Keong, a former chief economist of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, after they posted false and misleading statements about HDB’s deficits and Singapore’s past reserves.
Mr Yeoh published two Facebook posts on Oct 4, referring to the parliamentary reply from the National Development Minister to Mr Leong Mun Wai's question on HDB incurring an estimated development loss of about S$270 million from the Central Weave @ Ang Mo Kio Build-to-Order (BTO) project.
In a media release on Friday (Oct 14), the Ministry of National Development (MND) said Mr Yeoh's posts falsely convey that HDB will not incur a loss of about S$270 million from the project, and that the Government is free to sell state land at nominal or much lower cost than its fair market value.
""The Online Citizen (TOC) subsequently carried an article on the same day echoing the points raised in Yeoh’s Facebook posts,"" said MND.
On Oct 5, TOC published a second article headlined “Singapore’s reserves substantially profits from S$500m land sales in AMK BTO”.
The article claimed that Minister for National Development Desmond Lee’s parliamentary reply alluded to ""profits being made from the land sale by the government"" and that ""such profits would go to the reserves"", said the ministry.
""The headline falsely conveys that the Government’s sale of land to HDB for the AMK BTO project will lead to an increase in Singapore’s reserves.""
Recipients of a correction direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) are required to insert a notice against the original post or article, with a link to the Government’s clarification. 
Mr Yeoh and TOC have added correction notices to the post and articles in question.

MND said that the losses incurred by HDB are ""accurate and real"", adding that the agency's deficits are covered using funding from the annual Budget, which is raised from taxes and other revenue streams.
""Real money is involved, and this is certainly not an 'accounting sleight of hand',"" said MND.
It stressed that state land is part of Singapore's past reserves, and is not part of the assets that the Government can use as it wishes.
""When HDB requires land to develop flats, the land has to be taken out of the past reserves. HDB has to purchase the land by paying fair market value for the land, and the money goes into the past reserves. The estimated land cost for Central Weave @ AMK is about S$500 million,"" MND said.
""The Government cannot sell state land at nominal or much lower cost than its fair market value without the President’s approval, as doing so would constitute a draw on past reserves.""
Singapore's past reserves are protected by the Constitution for the benefit of current and future generations, noted MND.
""The Government cannot sell state land at nominal or much lower cost than its fair market value without the President’s approval, as doing so would constitute a draw on past reserves,"" it said, adding that there is an established process to determine the fair market value of land.
""Neither the Government nor the past reserves profit from land sales,"" MND said.
""For the Central Weave @ AMK BTO project, HDB will pay the Government fair market value for the land, estimated to be about S$500 million. This money will be paid into the past reserves, but does not result in a net increase in the past reserves."""
Singapore stands ready to 'robustly defend' sovereignty over Pedra Branca: MFA,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pedra-branca-singapore-stands-ready-robustly-defend-sovereignty-mfa-malaysia-legal-action-3008176,"SINGAPORE: Singapore stands ready to ""robustly defend"" its sovereignty over Pedra Branca, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson said on Friday (Oct 14).
The comments came a day after Malaysia announced its intention to continue legal action in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the issue of sovereignty over the island.
""Singapore is unable to comment on Malaysia's latest intentions since no details have been shared,"" the spokesperson said.
""Singapore stands ready to robustly defend our sovereignty over Pedra Branca and will deal with whatever legal action Malaysia may pursue.""
The spokesperson said that Singapore had noted Malaysia's press release on the matter, and revisited the details of the ICJ's 2008 ruling.
""In 2008, the Court awarded sovereignty over Pedra Branca to Singapore in the case concerning sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge,"" the spokesperson said.
""After the Court's decision, both Singapore and Malaysia publicly announced that they will accept and abide by the Court's decision which is final.
""In 2017, Malaysia instituted an application for revision and a request for interpretation of the Court's 2008 decision, which were subsequently withdrawn by Malaysia in 2018.
""Under the Statute of the Court, an application for revision cannot be made after the expiry of 10 years from the date of the Court’s 2008 judgment, that is, May 2018.""

Pedra Branca is located near the eastern entrance of the Straits of Singapore, about 44km east of mainland Singapore.
The dispute over Pedra Branca dates back to 1979, when Malaysia published a map indicating that the island was within the country’s territorial waters.
The matter was brought to the ICJ in 2003, and on May 23, 2008, it ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, while Middle Rocks was awarded to Malaysia and South Ledge belonged to the state in whose territorial waters it is located.
Malaysia filed two applications after the ruling, the first on Feb 2, 2017, to revise the ICJ's 2008 judgment.
Its case was hinged on three documents discovered in the National Archives of the United Kingdom that demonstrated officials at the highest levels ""did not consider Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca"" during the 1950s to 1960s.
The second application on Jun 30, 2017, sought an interpretation of the same ICJ judgment.
It requested that the ICJ declare the waters surrounding Pedra Branca to be Malaysia's and, in turn, the sovereignty of South Ledge belongs to Malaysia – a move that MFA described as ""puzzling"", ""unnecessary"" and ""without merit"". 
Public hearings for the two cases were scheduled for July 2018 at The Hague. However, Putrajaya decided to drop the two cases to revise and to interpret the judgment in May 2018.
In June 2019, then-Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad outlined that Putrajaya had accepted the ICJ ruling over Pedra Branca, citing it as an example of how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states have worked together based on mutual respect."
SMS sender ID registration mandatory for organisations; telcos to filter potential scam messages: IMDA,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/imda-organisations-mandatory-registration-sms-registry-sender-ids-telcos-filters-3008016,"SINGAPORE: As part of efforts to tackle scams, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) announced on Friday (Oct 14) new measures that will be implemented for all organisations and telecom operators.
Organisations that use SMS sender IDs will be required to register with the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) by January next year, said the authority. Registration with the SSIR is so that bona fide organisations can use such sender IDS.
Telecom operators will also implement SMS anti-scam filtering solutions within their networks, to automatically filter potential scam messages before they reach consumers, IMDA said in a news release.
These two measures come after public consultation and are part of the multi-pronged effort by IMDA and other stakeholders to further safeguard SMS as a communications channel. 
IMDA earlier announced the proposal for organisations to register with the SSIR in August, adding that it was working on it with the police, Government agencies and private sector partners.
IMDA set up the SSIR in March this year in response to a surge in SMS-related scams. Following its set up, there was a 64 per cent reduction in scams through SMS from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022. 
Scam cases perpetrated via SMSes make up about 8 per cent of scam reports in the second quarter of 2022, down from 10 per cent last year.
The current registry is a voluntary regime, said IMDA. This means that only organisations that want to proactively protect their Sender IDs register with the SSIR. 
""Moving forward, registration will be made mandatory. This means that only bona fide Sender IDs belonging to organisations, will be allowed,"" said IMDA, adding that all other sender IDs will be blocked.
The full registration requirement will take effect on Jan 31, 2023. 
Implementation by January 2023 is driven by the need to act proactively to strengthen the SSIR, said IMDA as it noted the support for the proposal by both the public and merchants.
""As some organisations may need more time to prepare and register, their SMS cannot be clearly differentiated from other SMS that come from unknown sources and may be scam messages,"" it added. 
As a transition measure, all non-registered SMS sender IDs after Jan 31, 2023 will be channelled to a sender ID with the header ""Likely-SCAM"". This is akin to a spam filter and spam bin and will be in place for about six months, said the authority.
Consumers are advised to exercise caution upon receiving such SMS as these are non-registered sender IDs, it said, adding that merchants are also urged to have their sender IDs registered early as possible with the registry.
TELCOS TO IMPLEMENT ANTI-SCAM FILTERS BY OCTOBER
Key mobile operators - Singtel, Starhub and M1, will implement anti-scam filtering solutions in their networks by the end of October, said IMDA.
""Machine-reading technology has made it possible to identify and filter potential scam messages upstream. Specifically, these solutions can detect malicious links within SMSes sent via our telecoms network,"" it added.

Together, the new measures form part of an ongoing approach to strengthen protection against scams, said IMDA.
This has been done with telecom operators to systematically reduce scam calls and SMS coming through the communication networks.
Combatting scams is a whole of society effort, and the public should continue to remain vigilant, it added.
""Scammers will continue to change their methods and tactics and there is no fool-proof measure even as we continue to monitor and implement additional safeguards.""
Members of the public that have any information relating to scams, including malicious SMSes, URLs and other links, they can be submitted online on iWitness. They can also submit information on malicious SMSes via the ScamShield app or the website."
"Setting the stage for expansion: Esplanade plans for more shops, F&B outlets","The Esplanade, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is looking to better appeal to families and the young in the coming years.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/esplanade-plans-more-commercial-spaces-3007966,"SINGAPORE: The Esplanade is setting the stage for its next phase of development, with plans to include more shops, food and beverage outlets and services. 
The performing arts venue, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is hoping to expand retail offerings beyond just the arts and introduce more unique brands with their own following. 
It is also looking at doing more with the waterfront space, said Ms Rachelle Tan, director of venues and planning at The Esplanade Co, which operates Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.
“We are looking at maybe more commercial spaces, certainly those that will make better use of the waterfront promenade but also serve as a better linkage between the main Esplanade building and Singtel Waterfront Theatre connecting to the wider Marina Bay precinct and the Civic District,” she told CNA.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the performing arts complex had around 3,500 activities a year, drawing more than two million people. 
While it is now working on more events to draw the crowds, tenants are already experiencing an uptick in business.
Among them is Ms Eileen Yap, founder of Singapore Fashion Runway. Many customers “love the uniqueness and a lot of them are art-goers”, she said. 
The mall has also been seeing close to full occupancy. One tenant noted that rental is still manageable, despite having gone up between 10 and 15 per cent post-pandemic.
Mr Leon Wan, store manager at vinyl record store The Analog Vault, said the events at The Esplanade do keep the place vibrant.

MAKING ARTS MORE ACCESSIBLE
To mark two decades of The Esplanade, a series of exhibitions, tours and installations have been organised. 
These include a projection-mapping show, “Dancing with Light”, where the walls of the Esplanade Courtyard come alive with lights and various performance elements. 
A new “Garden Tour” will also allow visitors to experience the waterfront and gardens with a fresh perspective.
The Esplanade has come a long way in making the arts more accessible and shifting the perception of the arts, its chief executive officer Yvonne Tham told CNA938's Asia First.
“It is at the heart of what we are trying to do, to be an arts centre for everyone. That’s why we were set up,” she said.
In the coming years, the Esplanade will be looking to deepen its work with vulnerable communities, so the venue becomes “more inclusive for people with different abilities”, she added."
What should you do to avoid agitating monkeys in your path? Some tips from a primatologist,"What should you do when there is a monkey in your path? And what are the misconceptions about their food sources? Primatologist Dr Andie Ang has the answers.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/what-do-when-encountering-monkeys-dr-andie-ang-3007981,"SINGAPORE: Dr Andie Ang’s first brush with a monkey was when she was 10 years old. 
A relative had brought a small juvenile vervet monkey back from Africa. She kept it home with her as a pet – not knowing it was illegal – until she realised that it was better off not being confined to a small space.
She eventually arranged for it to be sent back to Africa.
It may have been the end of her time with that monkey she affectionately called “Ah Boy”, but it was the beginning of her lifelong love for the primates.
Dr Ang, who holds a PhD in Biological Anthropology, is now a research scientist with Mandai Nature where she studies and conserves the endangered Raffles’ banded langurs in Singapore and Malaysia.
She spoke to CNA Podcast Climate Conversations about her experiences and gave insights into how the animals work. Here are her tips and tidbits when it comes to monkeys.




Listen:














WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE MONKEYS?
If you see a monkey in a nature spot, most of the time, it will not bother you if you do not disturb it, said Dr Ang.
“If you keep a safe distance, walk away and continue on your path, that'll be fine,” she said.
“But if the monkeys are in your path, you have to see whether there's another route that you can take or you might need to wait for them to disperse.”
Those who are in a rush, however, may make sounds to alert the monkeys, so that the animals are not surprised by their presence. They would usually disperse when they hear claps, she added.
Dr Ang also urged people who are visiting natural areas not to bring plastic bags, which the monkeys associate with food, or drinks in their hands.
“If we are not equipped with the knowledge to know how to interact with wildlife, that's when we might inevitably or accidentally attract them into urban areas or our homes,” she said.
WHAT TO DO IF A MONKEY TAKES YOUR CAR KEYS?
In general, if a monkey takes food items, “you can forget about it”, Dr Ang said.
But if the items are not food-related, there is value in patience.
“If it's not food-related, like your car keys or phone or your wallet, they might take it and bring it up to a tree. Wait for them to drop the items,” she said.
“They might be chewing a bit of your wallet, but they won't be eating it.”
NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES DO NOT HAPPEN OFTEN
While they have made the headlines, negative behaviours by monkeys do not happen that often, Dr Ang said.
“Ninety-nine per cent of the time … you read about behaviours that are quite negative, (but) it only happens maybe less than 5 per cent on the ground,” she said. 
This is because the monkeys usually make the news only when there has been an incident or accident, she added.
Monkeys have made headlines in Singapore for snatching bags and entering homes to take food, but Dr Ang said that she hopes that when people talk about the primates, they do not use adjectives like “naughty, mischievous, cheeky and aggressive”.
MISCONCEPTION ABOUT FOOD SUPPLY
People may have the misconception that monkeys may be finding other food sources because they do not have enough in the forest, Dr Ang said.
“The monkeys have sufficient food in the forest and the food that they eat will be plants. They could also take in small animals like lizards or bird eggs,” she said.
However, it may be more efficient for them to eat food meant for humans.
“Because the food that humans eat is full of high calories and energy content … if they were to take those food items, they would get their calorie intake for the day within just a short amount of time,” she said.
“So if you were to leave food out there unattended or trash bins are not closed properly, then the animals would stay and get those food (items).”
HOW TO DEAL WITH BABY MONKEYS?
Dr Ang warned that people should watch where the baby monkeys are, and advised against walking too close to them.
Adding this is like humans being protective of babies, she said: “When they're infants, of course the adults will be more protective.”"
COE quota to drop by 13.7% for the November to January quarter,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coe-quota-vehicles-november-january-drop-lta-3007911,"SINGAPORE: The Certificate of Entitlement (COE) quota for the November 2022 to January 2023 bidding exercises will fall by 13.7 per cent.
A total of 9,128 COEs will be available for the quarter, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Friday (Oct 14). This is a decrease from the August to October quota of 10,581.
The last time a lower quota was recorded came during the February to April 2014 period, when 9,127 COEs were available.
The November 2022 to January 2023 quota translates to a monthly average of 3,040 COEs for all categories combined, according to figures from LTA.
Bidding under this quota will start on Nov 7.
The COE quota consists of 50 per cent of the replacement COEs from vehicles deregistered in the six-month period of April 2022 to September 2022 and a provision for 0.25 per cent per annum growth for Category C based on the Category C vehicle population as at Dec 31, 2021. 
It also includes adjustments for changes in the taxi population, replacement of commercial vehicles under the Early Turnover Scheme, and expired COEs.

LTA announced in July that the method for computing the quota available for COE bidding would be adjusted to reduce volatility in supply.
From August, supply was based on a rolling average of vehicle deregistrations over two quarters instead of one.
This is to ""reduce the quarter-on-quarter volatility of COE supply while being responsive in returning the COEs of deregistered vehicles to the bidding pool”, LTA said in a media release at the time.
The next quota announcement for the bidding period of February 2023 to April 2023 will be made in January 2023."
'More responsible' to proceed with GST increase amid uncertain inflation outlook: Lawrence Wong,"This will help Singapore secure the revenues needed for its growing expenditure needs, says the Deputy Prime Minister.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gst-increase-responsible-inflation-lawrence-wong-spending-expenditure-needs-3007771,"SINGAPORE: The global inflation outlook may be uncertain but Singapore's growing spending needs are clear.
And to pay for these, the ""more responsible approach"" is for Singapore to proceed with a planned Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike in the coming years, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Oct 14).
He was speaking at a press conference to announce up to S$500 in cash handouts for each eligible Singaporean, as part of a S$1.5 billion support package targeting the lower- to middle-income groups.

How the S$1.5b support package aims to help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living













The Government had announced in June a similarly sized S$1.5 billion plan to also help with rising inflation and cost of living.
Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, was asked by reporters if these were stopgap measures to deal with the longer-term impact of a rise in GST.
The tax is set to increase from 7 per cent to 8 per cent in 2023, and to further go up to 9 per cent in 2024.
""I understand the concerns that people have about raising the GST rate at a time when inflation is high, and the desire to defer the GST increase until a situation when inflation may be better,"" said Mr Wong.
""(But) we must also be realistic that inflation is not going back to the situation which we were used to over the past decade, where it was very low rates of inflation.""
Singapore’s core inflation has reached decade highs this year and earlier on Friday, its central bank tightened monetary policy for the fifth time since October 2021, in another attempt to curb inflation.
Mr Wong said on Friday that going forward, the new normal would be ""a much higher rate of inflation than we were used to in the past"".
""At the same time, this inflation outlook is also very uncertain,"" he added, pointing to the possibility of a protracted Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting in fresh disruptions to food and energy supplies.

'While we have this uncertain inflation outlook, our spending needs are very certain. They are just going up year by year,"" said Mr Wong.
""It's going to be very hard for us to time our revenue-raising measures with the uncertain inflation outlook. So we think, having looked at the matter, that a more responsible approach is to proceed with the GST increase, so that we can secure the revenues we need for our growing expenditure needs.""
The minister stressed that the Government would offset and cushion the impact of the GST increase on Singaporeans, especially the lower- and middle-income groups.
""We will make sure that they are well taken care of,"" he said.
The Assurance Package - first announced in 2020 to cover additional GST expenses for households - will be updated to take into account higher inflation, with more details to come at next year's Budget, said Mr Wong.
""What it means is that the higher income Singaporeans, the foreigners who are here, the tourists who are here will be paying an additional GST increase,"" he added.
""And helping us to provide the revenues we need to fund all the spending that we have to do, to take better care of our seniors and to provide for our vulnerable groups.""

"Man jailed for giving woman drug-laced water, hoping it would 'enhance sex'",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-giving-woman-drug-laced-water-hoping-it-would-enhance-sex-3007846,"SINGAPORE: A man gave his sex partner a bottle of water after lacing it with a drug, thinking it would ""enhance sex"" if she drank it.
However, the drug Modafinil was a prescription medicine meant for narcolepsy, and it gave the woman side effects including pain and vomiting.
The 28-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, was sentenced to 15 months' jail on Friday (Oct 14).
He pleaded guilty to two charges of giving the woman a stupefying substance with intent to cause hurt and of sending the woman's private images to his friend.
The court heard that the man was working as a delivery driver at the time. He was in a ""casual sexual relationship"" with the victim from February 2021.
The man had previously obtained Modafinil from a friend although he did not suffer from narcolepsy.
He knew the drug enhanced wakefulness and he thought it would enhance sex.
Sometime in 2021, the man told the victim that he was having suicidal thoughts, in order to compel her to visit him.
When she got to his home, the man handed her a water bottle. She did not know that he had crushed an unknown quantity of Modafinil in the liquid. He thought the drug would have stimulant effects on the victim and enhance sex for him.
The side effects of Modafinil include headache, blurred vision, insomnia, depression, irritability, a faster heartbeat, abdominal pain, dry mouth and abnormal thinking, said the prosecutor.
After the victim drank the drug-laced water, she felt pain, discomfort, extreme nausea and felt her heart beat faster.
When she asked the accused what he did, he laughed and admitted to putting Modafinil in the water. 
The victim and the offender had an on-and-off relationship after that. The offender grew upset because he suspected the victim was meeting other men, even though they were in a non-exclusive arrangement. 
Sometime near the end of 2021, the woman blocked the offender as she did not want him to contact her any longer. Despite this, he persisted in trying to do so.
He also vented his frustrations to a friend and said he was going to send the victim's nudes to the other man he suspected she was seeing.
He sent his friend at least four intimate photos of the woman.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En asked for a jail term of between 12 and 18 months for the drugging charge, and three to four months' jail for the charge of dissemination of intimate images.
He asked for the jail terms to run consecutively as the offences occurred on different occasions.
The defence asked for a total of 15 months' jail.
The judge said he took note that administering a stupefying substance to cause hurt is a serious offence. He also noted that the victim was identifiable in the second charge which involved four photos."
How the S$1.5b support package aims to help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living,"2.5 million Singaporeans will get up to S$500 in cash to help with rising expenses. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/how-s15b-support-package-aims-help-singaporeans-cope-rising-cost-living-3007646,"SINGAPORE: A new S$1.5 billion support package was announced on Friday (Oct 14) to help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living, with more support for lower-income households.
Building on support measures announced during this year's Budget as well as in April and June, the new package will be funded by the “better-than-expected” fiscal out-turn in the first half of this financial year. There will be no draw on past reserves.
In a press release on Friday, the Ministry of Finance said the new package, together with earlier rounds of support measures rolled out this year, will fully cover the increase in cost of living for lower-income households on average.
It added that for middle-income households, this will cover more than half of the increase in cost of living. 
Here are some of the key measures:
Cash payouts to cover increase in cost of living
A one-off Cost-of-Living (COL) special payment of up to S$500 will be paid to eligible Singaporeans in December, together with the Assurance Package for GST Cash Payout announced at this year’s Budget.
To qualify for the COL special payment, the recipient must be aged 21 and above in 2023, with an assessable income (AI) of not more than S$100,000 in the Year of Assessment (YA) 2022. They must also not own more than one property.
The special payment ranges from S$300 to S$500, depending on the recipient’s AI.
Those with an AI of not more than S$22,000 will receive S$500, while those with an AI above S$22,000 but not more than S$34,000 will receive S$400.
The remaining eligible Singaporeans, who have an AI above S$34,000 but not more than S$100,000, will receive S$300.
About 2.5 million Singaporeans will benefit from the special payment.
No application is required and more details will be made available next month.
More CDC vouchers
A new tranche of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers worth S$100 will be given to every Singaporean household in January 2023.
This is on top of the S$200 CDC vouchers announced at this year’s Budget, bringing the total to S$300.
No application is needed and the vouchers can be used at participating hawkers and heartland merchants, which will be identified by the CDC voucher decal. 
You may search for the nearest participating hawkers and heartland merchants here.
The Government is also working towards allowing the donation of CDC Vouchers, with more details to be provided later.

Public transport subsidies and vouchers
First announced on Wednesday, a total of 600,000 public transport vouchers valued at S$30 will be made available to lower-income households to help them cope with an upcoming increase in bus and train fares.
From Dec 26, adult card fares will increase by 4 cents for journeys of up to 8.2km and five cents for anything longer than that.
Students, senior citizens, lower-wage workers and people with disabilities, will also see an increase in concession card fares but this will be capped at 1 cent per journey.
Similar to last year’s Public Transport Vouchers exercise, it will cover resident households with a monthly household income per person of not more than S$1,600.
The vouchers can be used to top up fare cards or buy monthly concession passes, and must be redeemed by Mar 31, 2024.
As part of the S$1.5 billion support package, the Government will also set aside S$200 million to mitigate the impact of the fare increase on commuters and pay for higher costs of providing public transport services due to the increase in energy prices, manpower costs and inflation.
This is on top of the current subsidies of more than S$2 billion per year to run bus and train services.
Financial assistance for more students
The Ministry of Education (MOE) will raise the income eligibility criteria for financial assistance schemes to help defray school expenses such as textbooks and transport for more students.
Under the revised criteria for financial assistance schemes for primary, secondary, and pre-university students - those with a gross monthly household income (GHI) or per capita income (PCI) of not more than S$3,000 and S$750 respectively will be eligible for financial aid.
This is up from the current GHI and PCI criteria of not more than S$2,750 and S$690 respectively.
This applies to schemes including the MOE financial assistance scheme (MOE FAS) for Government and Government-aided Schools (GGAS) and Specialised Schools (SS), the Special Education FAS for MOE-funded SPED schools, and will take effect from Jan 1, 2023. Applications can be made through the respective schools.
As for government bursaries for post-secondary education institutions and enhancements of the bursary quanta for full-time Institute of Technical Education students, this will take effect from the assessment year of 2023.
It comes after MOE announced in August that it would increase transport and meal subsidies for primary and secondary students under its financial assistance schemes and bursaries for pre-university students from Jan 1, 2023.
Meanwhile, government bursaries for diploma and undergraduate students are currently being reviewed by MOE, with more details to be shared when ready."
Man jailed for recording woman in shower with 'spy-cam' spectacles ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-recording-woman-shower-spy-cam-spectacles-3007681,"SINGAPORE: A man bought a pair of spectacles with a pinhole camera and video-recording function in order to record his female housemates showering.
However, he was caught when one of them noticed the pair of glasses with a blinking red light.
Zhang Haibo, 29, was sentenced on Friday (Oct 14) to 15 weeks' jail.
He pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism and possessing a voyeuristic recording, with a third charge considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Zhang stayed in a residence with other fellow China nationals.
Around end-August 2021, he wanted to make recordings in the common toilet, so he searched online for a ""spy camera"".
He bought a recording device disguised as a pair of black spectacles for S$40. The glasses had a pinhole camera in them, with a video-recording function that could store footage in a memory card embedded in the spectacles.
On Aug 27, 2021, Zhang placed the spectacles on a metal rack above the sink of the common toilet, positioning the camera towards the shower area.
He intended to record the female tenants using the shower.
At about 1pm the next day, a 35-year-old woman entered the toilet, undressed and began to shower. As she was showering, she noticed the glasses on the metal rack.
She was suspicious as she had not seen them there before. She examined the glasses and realised there was a blinking red light emitting from the glasses.
She told her landlord about the spectacles, and all the tenants were questioned about the device. Zhang did not admit to his offence at first.
The woman was worried there were other videos recorded, so she made a police report along with a fellow female tenant. Zhang was arrested that same day.
Several devices were seized from Zhang, and a video of a woman's buttocks recorded with Zhang's phone was found in his laptop.
The prosecution asked for 15 to 18 weeks' jail, acknowledging Zhang's lack of prior convictions and early plea of guilt."

OTHER SUPPORT MEASURES
Every household with at least one Singapore citizen will get an additional S$100 Community Development Council (CDC) voucher in January next year. This is on top of the S$200 CDC voucher announced at Budget 2022.
Of the S$300 vouchers given to each household in total, half can be spent at supermarkets and the remaining at heartland shops and hawkers.
“The Government is also working towards allowing the donation of CDC vouchers,” MOF added.
More details on the vouchers will be released by the CDCs soon.
The Ministry of Education (MOE) will raise the income eligibility criteria for financial assistance schemes from Jan 1 next year for primary, secondary and pre-university students.
The raise will take effect from academic year 2023 for government bursaries for post-secondary and education institutions.
For instance, under the MOE financial assistance scheme for government and government-aided schools and specialised schools, the income eligibility criteria will be raised to a gross household income of less than or equal to S$3,000, or a per capita income of less than or equal to S$750.
The bursary quanta for full-time Institute of Technical Education students will also be enhanced from academic year 2023.
“MOE is reviewing the government bursaries for diploma and undergraduate students, and will share more details when ready,” MOF said.











This latest round of support measures comes after the Government announced in June a support package for households and businesses to help mitigate increased living costs from inflation and rising energy prices.
This aid, also worth S$1.5 billion, was similarly aimed at the lower-income and more vulnerable groups, and not funded by past reserves.
The latest package also builds on cost of living support measures announced in February during Budget 2022, which the Government announced in April would be brought forward amid a global rise in prices.
“This new S$1.5 billion support package, together with earlier rounds of support measures rolled out this year, will fully cover the increase in cost of living for lower-income households on average, and more than half of the increase in cost of living for middle-income households on average this year,” MOF said.
Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said during a press conference on Friday that the range of support measures this year will also fully cover the increase in cost of living for retiree households.
""I understand that Singaporeans are also concerned about the upcoming GST increase, and as I have explained previously, the Government is fully committed to cushion the impact of the GST increase for all Singaporeans,"" he said.
The first GST increase from 7 per cent to 8 per cent will take place on Jan 1, 2023, and the second increase from 8 per cent to 9 per cent will take place on Jan 1, 2024.
Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, reiterated that the enhanced Assurance Package, announced in Budget 2022, is meant to cover at least five years of additional GST expenses for the majority of Singaporean households, and about 10 years for lower-income households.
""And to keep to this commitment, we will review the sizing and components of the Assurance Package to account for the higher-than-expected inflation, and I will provide more details on this at Budget next year,"" he said.
""The Government will continue to live within our means and ensure fiscal sustainability.""

Government will do 'utmost' to help Singaporeans cope with cost of living concerns: Lawrence Wong













Earlier on Friday, Singapore’s central bank tightened monetary policy as expected, for the fifth time in a year.
On top of its regular adjustments in April and October, the Monetary Authority of Singapore made two surprise moves in January and July, in bids to strengthen the Singapore dollar and dampen inflation.
Singapore’s core inflation has been steadily rising and August’s figure of 5.1 per cent was just shy of a 14-year high of 5.5 per cent reported in November 2008.
“While supply chain frictions have eased slightly, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to put pressure on commodity prices,” MOF said.
“As a small, open economy, Singapore is particularly susceptible to imported price pressures, through channels such as food and energy.
“Domestically, a tight labour market continues to support strong wage growth. As such, we must be prepared for inflation to stay elevated for some time.”"

The recipients of the correction direction are Thailand Medical News, which published the article on Oct 9, Singapore opposition politician Goh Meng Seng, the Facebook page Goh Meng Seng People's Power Party and HardwareZone Forum.
Mr Goh shared the article on his Facebook pages on Oct 10. It was also posted on a HardwareZone forum thread on the same day. 
Recipients of the correction direction are required to insert a notice against the original post or article, with a link to the Government’s clarification. All four parties have done so.
In a media release on Friday (Oct 14), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said there were false and misleading statements in the article titled ""BREAKING! Singapore Is Under Attack By The New SARS-CoV-2 XBB Recombinant Variant"".
""The article claimed that increased disease severity of COVID-19 is becoming a common occurrence, even in the fully vaccinated. The article also claimed that mortuaries, funeral parlours, and crematoria are facing a ‘pile up’ in cases. These claims are false,"" said MOH.
It added that there has been no evidence of the XBB variant causing more severe illness than previous variants.
“In fact, our local data in the last two weeks shows that XBB cases are estimated to have a 30 per cent lower risk of hospitalisation compared to Omicron BA.5 variant cases,” the ministry said. “MOH also did not observe increases in COVID-19 deaths over the past month.""
The article was first published on the website of Thailand Medical News, as well as on its Facebook and Twitter pages. 
""Although Thailand Medical News has since amended the article, the article as first published on Oct 9, 2022, misrepresented the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and had been circulating in private messaging chats and other social media channels, and could cause undue public concern,"" said the Health Ministry.

Tan Chee Boon, 47, was charged on Friday (Oct 14) with cheating and forgery offences.
The money had come from two AVA-administered programmes that provided funding support for farmers in Singapore to buy equipment to increase farm production.
In 2015, Tan received S$35,000 from the Food Fund to reimburse Marine Life Aquaculture for equipment purportedly purchased, said police in a news release on Friday. 
He allegedly cheated AVA by dishonestly concealing from it in September and October 2016 that the equipment had not been purchased. 
In 2016, Tan allegedly submitted fictitious quotations from a purported overseas company to get approval for funding support of up to S$1.4 million under the Agriculture Productivity Fund.
Under the approved funding support, he allegedly cheated AVA in 2017 into disbursing S$211,400 to reimburse Marine Life Aquaculture for equipment that the company did not buy. 
For cheating, Tan could be jailed for up to three years and/or fined.
If convicted of forgery for the purpose of cheating, Tan could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.
The penalty for cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property is a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine."
"Felicia Teo case: Jail for man who dumped and burned body, lied to police to cover up drug offences","Ms Felicia Teo had died of unknown circumstances after consuming ecstasy on Jun 30, 2007. To avoid prosecution for drug offences, Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa’ee placed her body in a carton box with his accomplice before burning it.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ahmad-danial-mohamed-rafaee-sentenced-jail-depositing-felicia-teo-body-taking-belongings-false-evidence-3006551,"SINGAPORE: A man who was originally charged with the murder of 19-year-old Felicia Teo 13 years after she went missing was sentenced on Friday (Oct 14) to 26 months' jail for lesser charges.
Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, admitted to four charges of depositing Ms Teo's corpse, misappropriating her belongings, fabricating false evidence and giving false evidence to the police. Another two charges were considered in sentencing.
However, as Ahmad Danial had spent more than one-and-a-half years on remand, he will likely not have to serve more jail time after factoring in remission.
He had allegedly committed the offences with an accomplice, Mr Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is now 32 and at large.
Ahmad Danial was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge in June this year, after being remanded for about one-and-a-half years.
Prosecutors said the main reason they asked for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was because Mr Ragil was still at large, with no evidence that he was dead.
THE CASE
Ms Teo, who would have been 34 this year, was a student at La Salle College of Fine Arts as it was known at the time. Mr Ragil, who was 18 at the time, was her schoolmate while Ahmad Danial was then a 22-year-old graphic designer.
On Jul 3, 2007, Ms Teo's mother lodged a police report, saying her daughter was missing and uncontactable. She had last seen her daughter on Jun 29, 2007.
She said her daughter was last seen with Ahmad Danial and Mr Ragil. However, when questioned, Ahmad Danial and Mr Ragil lied to the police that Ms Teo had left the unit to meet someone at East Coast Park.
Ahmad Danial lied to investigators that Ms Teo had left angrily after he made comments about her having many boyfriends and calling her a ""bitch"".
However, what really happened was that the trio returned to Mr Ragil's flat in Marine Terrace on the early morning of Jun 30, 2007, after a party at La Salle.
The trio consumed ecstasy inside the flat. Sometime before 6am, Ms Teo died due to unknown circumstances.
When the two men realised she was dead, they came up with a plan to dispose of her body as they did not want to get into trouble for drug consumption nor go to jail.
The men placed Ms Teo's body on a mattress in the flat and covered it with another mattress to hide the body. They cleaned up the unit and took her phone, placing it near East Coast Park to mislead the police.
That same day, the two men went to hardware shops to buy tools to dispose of the body. They then returned to the flat, placed the body in a carton box and sealed it with tape.
They carried the body to the ground floor via the staircase, to avoid closed-circuit television cameras at the lift lobby.
They took a cab to Punggol Track 24 with the carton box containing her body. At a deserted location there, they dug a hole in the ground and placed the box in the hole, before pouring kerosene over it and lighting it on fire.
After the fire died down, the pair covered the hole and left the location before disposing of the tools. That same day, they took Ms Teo's laptop, camera and camera lenses. Ahmad Danial later gave the laptop to his father.
TWO MEN LIED TO POLICE
After Ms Teo was reported missing, police interviewed both Ahmad Danial and Mr Ragil.
As part of their agreed plan, they both said they had gone to Mr Ragil's flat with Ms Teo early Jun 30, 2007. However, they said she had left the unit sometime after 2.30am that same day.
The pair maintained that Ms Teo never returned to the flat after she left and that they did not see her again. 
Ahmad Danial in particular gave two sets of false statements to the police on Jul 11 and Jul 25 in 2007.
In the first instance, he lied that Ms Teo had left the flat on her own. He claimed that she had been busy sending messages on her phone while they were at Mr Ragil's flat.
""Her ring tone was loud and I just asked whether she was sending the messages to her ex-boyfriend. She replied that it was some other guy. I then commented that she was a bitch by having so many boyfriends. She did not reply and then left Ragil's place,"" said Ahmad Danial in his statement.
In the second statement on Jul 25, 2007, Ahmad Danial claimed that Ms Teo was smoking in the living room at the time. He said he told her to reduce the volume or silence her ring tone as it was looping with incoming SMS ringing tones.
After he made his comment, Ahmad Danial said Ms Teo kept silent and stormed out with her white bag and laptop.
As there was insufficient evidence to suspect any foul play on the part of the two men, no further investigations were conducted against them in 2007.
The police recorded statements from colleagues, close friends and family members in relation to the case to find leads. 
It was treated as a missing person case until 2020, with police consistently reviewing the case for 13 years. They conducted immigration, bank and EZ-Link card screenings, and made checks on hospitals, mortuaries and telco subscribers.
The police also constantly engaged Ms Teo's family to check for new information, monitored social media platforms and issued a police gazette for her. 
In 2020, when the police conducted a fresh screening of Ms Teo's laptop, investigations revealed that Ahmad Danial had come into possession of the laptop, despite him claiming in 2007 that Ms Teo had left the flat with all her belongings.
They arrested Ahmad Danial, and he admitted to lying in 2007.
In June 2010, a partial human skull was found during excavation works at Punggol Track 24. The identity of the skull was unknown at the time.
After Ahmad Danial's arrest, screenings were conducted on skeletons found in the Punggol area. DNA testing revealed that the skull likely belonged to Ms Teo. No other remains were discovered despite efforts to dig around the area.
OFFENCES PREMEDITATED, KEPT FAMILY IN DARK: PROSECUTOR
Prosecutors asked for 27 months' jail for Ahmad Danial, pointing to the planning and premeditation involved in disposing of the body. It was burnt such that to this day, only the partial skull fragment remains, said Mr Yang Ziliang.
Ahmad Danial fabricated evidence that ensured he was not arrested in 2007 for drug consumption offences, said Mr Yang. His actions also ensured that Mr Ragil was not arrested and remains at large, he added.
His act also resulted in the perversion of justice for a long period of 13 years, with Ms Teo's friends and family kept in the dark of her demise, said Mr Yang.
Ahmad Danial was defended by lawyers Shashi Nathan, Tania Chin and Laura Yeo from Withers KhattarWong.
Mr Nathan said his client was not the same man now. At the time, he was a young man and was ""just trying to deflect from the drug offences"".
He added that when the two men had found Ms Teo, she had already passed on and her body was cold to the touch.
In response, Mr Yang said there was no way of knowing if Ahmad Danial's claims are true.
He pointed to the mitigation plea, which stated that in the past 13 years, not a day had gone by without Ahmad Danial deeply regretting his conduct and wishing he had called the authorities.
The mitigation plea also stated that Ahmad Danial contemplated his surrender on numerous occasions.
""We say these claims ring hollow,"" said Mr Yang. ""On Jun 30, 2007, he could have come clean, but instead he spent the whole day planning how to dispose of the body while it was concealed between two mattresses in Ragil's room.""
He added that Ahmad Danial​​​​​​​ did not come clean in his statements.
""So we say it appears that he's just sorry he got caught instead of being sorry for the offences,"" said Mr Yang.
In sentencing, Principal District Judge Toh Han Li said the efforts by the two men were elaborate and their actions denied family members the chance to have a proper burial for Ms Teo.
The actions also ensured that Ahmad Danial​​​​​​​ and Mr Ragil were never arrested in 2007 for drug offences, said Judge Toh.
At the time, sentencing guidelines for drug offences indicated between six and 18 months' jail for first offenders, and this is relevant for the sentence which Ahmad Danial​​​​​​​ managed to avoid, he said.
As a result, Ms Teo's family and friends were kept in the dark for 13 years and unable to get closure. 
Ahmad Danial will be mounting an appeal for the discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge to be changed to a discharge amounting to acquittal, his lawyers said."
From new wellness spots to improved accessibility: The plan to turn Dempsey into a green lifestyle destination,"The Singapore Land Authority is looking out for more innovative concepts to draw crowds.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dempsey-lifestyle-green-living-destination-3005961,"SINGAPORE: Dempsey is set to offer more than just high-profile restaurants and gourmet grocers, with plans to turn the former military barracks into a lifestyle and green living destination.
More tenders for vacant units are expected to be called over the next few months. 
Beyond retail and food and beverage businesses, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) hopes to bring in wellness and sports concepts into the area. 
In particular, it will be looking out for more innovative concepts, including sustainability initiatives, in the new tender proposals.
Ms Carrie Wong, deputy director of Business Planning and Development at SLA, said: “As the COVID-19 situation stabilises, we are hoping that the market conditions have recovered, and we are looking forward to receiving more tender proposals.”

The aim is to introduce a greater mix of businesses and activities, and draw in even bigger crowds.
MIX OF BUSINESSES
Over the years, Dempsey has been transformed into an area with diverse offerings, said Ms Wong. ""We are looking at how we can further enhance it by introducing broader uses, such as local and international cuisine, wellness and artisan craft.""
Tenants interviewed said they are excited by the plans for the location. 
Huber's Butchery, which has been at Dempsey for nearly a decade, is set to stay put for another nine years. It recently won the tender for the highly coveted space at 22 Dempsey Road. 
The company is looking to refresh its space. 
The possible changes include improving its herb and vegetable garden, expanding the children’s playground, putting in solar panels, bringing in a food digesting machine and installing electric vehicle fast-charging lots, said Huber's executive director Andre Huber. 
















“We also have a recycling station which is open to all tenants in Dempsey to use, so they can bring their recyclables,” he added.
 “We will have our own recycling bins here to encourage customers to use them and have this recycling culture.”

LIFESTYLE DESTINATION
Mr Huber hopes that the various agencies can continue to promote Dempsey “as a nice lifestyle destination for people to come with their families, and even for tourists to experience the best of Singapore”.
Huber's Butchery is one of six tenants awarded tenders at Dempsey in the past two years. The other five are first-time tenants there.
One of the tenants, Singapore’s first gin distillery Tanglin Gin, said it would like greater accessibility to the area. 
“Dempsey is definitely a destination, and that's why I think it also works. People see it as something that they look forward to going to experience,” said its general manager Bradley Young. 
“So hopefully within the next year, we can have a bit more ease of people's footfall to get up to this area."""
MAS tightens monetary policy for the fifth time in a year to dampen inflation,"The central bank said that a further tightening of monetary policy is needed to help “ensure that price pressures are dampened over the next few quarters”.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/monetary-authority-singapore-mas-tighten-monetary-policy-fifth-time-3007081,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has tightened monetary policy for the fifth time in a year, allowing a further strengthening in the Singapore dollar to help dampen inflation.
In its half-yearly monetary policy statement released on Friday (Oct 14), the Singapore central bank said it will re-centre the mid-point of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band “up to its prevailing level”.
The slope and width of the band were left unchanged.
In general by tightening monetary policy, MAS is effectively allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate. This makes imports cheaper and in turn helps to put a lid on the rise in prices of goods and services here.
The central bank noted that the global economy faces high inflation and lower growth next year, while Singapore’s economic growth will ""come in below trend"" in 2023 amid intensified downside risks.
At the same time, core inflation is expected to remain elevated over the next few quarters, with risks still tilted to the upside.
“MAS has assessed that, on balance, a further tightening of monetary policy is needed to help ensure that price pressures are dampened over the next few quarters,” it said.
This marks MAS’ fifth policy tightening move in a row.

Explainer: How does MAS monetary policy work and can it help tame inflation?













It first tightened policy in October last year when it slightly raised the slope of its exchange-rate based policy band to allow the Singapore dollar to appreciate at a slightly faster pace.
It then followed up with another steepening of the slope in January, surprising markets with an inter-meeting adjustment, before making a two-in-one move in April to raise the slope while re-centering the mid-point of the policy band.
MAS re-centred the mid-point again in an off-cycle move in July as a “further calibrated step” to tame inflation.
The central bank described its latest announcement as “building on past tightening moves” and will help to further reduce imported inflation and curb domestic cost pressures.
“The policy stance will help dampen inflation in the near term and ensure medium-term price stability, providing the basis for sustainable economic growth,” it said.
“MAS will continue to closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, amid heightened uncertainty on both the inflation and growth fronts.”
HOW SINGAPORE MANAGES ITS MONETARY POLICY
Singapore's central bank has a unique approach to monetary policy.
Unlike most central banks that manage monetary policy through the interest rate, it uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool because Singapore is an open economy that depends heavily on trade.
This refers to the S$NEER – the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar managed against a trade-weighted undisclosed basket of currencies from Singapore’s major trading partners.
MAS allows the S$NEER to float within an unspecified band. Should it go out of this band, it steps in by buying or selling Singapore dollars.
The central bank also changes the slope, width and mid-point of the band when it wants to adjust the pace of appreciation or depreciation of the local currency based on assessed risks to Singapore’s growth and inflation.
With Singapore buying almost everything it consumes from abroad, a stronger Singapore dollar will help convert foreign prices of imports into lower local prices. The flip side of that, however, is a possible hit on the competitiveness of the country's exports.





      The three policy levers of MAS
  

1. The slope
This is probably the most common tool used by the MAS to adjust the band.
Simply put, the slope determines the rate at which the Sing dollar appreciates. If the slope is reduced, this means the local currency will be allowed to strengthen at a slower pace. It strengthens at a faster pace when the slope is increased.
2. The mid-point
This is a tool generally reserved for “drastic” situations, such as recessions, when the outlook for growth and inflation sees an abrupt and rapid change.
Compared to tweaks in the slope, an adjustment in the mid-point either upwards or downwards is likely to yield a quicker and bigger impact on the currency, economists have said.
3. The width
This controls how far the Sing dollar can fluctuate. This means the wider the band, the more volatile the currency can be.
It is typically reserved for periods of increased uncertainties or volatility.
For instance, the band was widened in October 2001 after the Sep 11 terrorist attacks in the United States led to extreme volatility in the financial markets. More recently in October 2010, the width was also widened slightly “in view of the volatility across international financial markets”.

INFLATION PRESSURES TO PERSIST
Latest data showed consumer prices in Singapore continuing to climb in August on the back of stronger increases in the prices of food and services.
Core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport costs, hit 5.1 per cent year-on-year, up from 4.8 per cent in the previous month and marked its highest level since it touched 5.5 per cent in November 2008.
August’s headline consumer price index (CPI), or overall inflation, came in at 7.5 per cent year on year, surpassing the 7 per cent in July.
MAS said on Friday that it expects core inflation to “stay around 5 per cent” for the rest of the year, and into early 2023.
It noted that the confluence of demand and supply factors behind higher-than-expected price increases in the third quarter is set to persist. A tight domestic labour market will support robust wage increases, while imported inflation will remain significant across a range of intermediate and final goods.
For the whole of 2022, the central bank expects core inflation to average around 4 per cent while headline inflation is projected to be around 6 per cent.
These are at the upper end of its earlier estimates. MAS had previously predicted full-year core inflation to be between 3 to 4 per cent, and headline inflation to be at 5 to 6 per cent.
Moving into 2023, cost pressures which have been accumulating along domestic and global supply chains will continue to pass through to consumer prices.
“Even as prices of energy and food commodities have moderated from their peaks, businesses will face higher utility and raw material costs as contracts are renewed,” MAS said.
“The pace of domestic unit labour cost increases should ease over the course of 2023, as labour demand and supply rebalance, but remain above its historical average.”
The one-percentage point increase in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) – from 7 per cent to 8 per cent – will have a “one-off step-up” in price levels, but the effect on inflation should be “transitory”, it added.
Taking into account all factors including the GST increase, core inflation for 2023 should come in at 3.5 to 4.5 per cent while headline inflation is seen at 5.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Excluding the one-off effects from the GST hike, core inflation would “remain above trend” at 2.5 to 3.5 per cent and headline inflation at 4.5 to 5.5 per cent.
MAS warned of “upside risks” to these forecasts, including from fresh shocks to global commodity prices and second-round effects associated with a prolonged period of high inflation.
The monetary policy decision comes alongside official advance estimates that showed the Singapore economy expanded 4.4 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, easing slightly from the 4.5 per cent growth in the earlier quarter.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, gross domestic product grew by 1.5 per cent, a turnaround from the 0.2 per cent contraction in the earlier three months.

Singapore's economic growth slows down to 4.4% in Q3: MTI advance estimates,"Third-quarter growth, which topped economists' forecasts, was bolstered by rebounds in the construction and services sectors.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-gdp-economy-third-quarter-q3-mti-advance-estimates-3005856,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy grew at a slower pace of 4.4 per cent, but exceeded expectations, in the third quarter of 2022, according to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Friday (Oct 14).
This compares with a revised figure of 4.5 per cent in the previous quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.4 per cent expansion for the July to September period from a year ago.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.5 per cent after contracting 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
Authorities had in August narrowed the official growth forecast for 2022 to a range of 3 per cent to 4 per cent, from 3 per cent to 5 per cent on the back of a weakening external demand outlook.
The advance GDP estimates for the third quarter of 2022 are computed largely from data in July and August. They are intended as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter and are subject to revision when more comprehensive data becomes available, said MTI.
The preliminary GDP estimates for the third quarter of this year will be released by MTI in November.

CONSTRUCTION SECTOR GROWTH ACCELERATES
The manufacturing sector expanded by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, slower than the 5.7 per cent growth in the previous quarter. 
Growth during the quarter was supported by output expansions in the transport engineering, general manufacturing and precision engineering clusters, except for the electronics and chemicals clusters.
The construction sector grew by 7.8 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, accelerating from the 4.8 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.
Both public and private construction output picked up during the third quarter, partly supported by the easing of border restrictions on the migrant workers coming into Singapore.
In absolute terms, the value-added of the construction sector remained 18 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. 
Among the services sectors, the wholesale and retail trade as well as the transportation and storage sectors collectively grew by 6.2 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter. 
All sectors within the group recorded expansion, said MTI. 
Growth in the retail trade and transportation and storage sectors was supported in part by a low base last year as domestic and travel restrictions had an effect on activities in these sectors. 
The group of sectors comprising information and communications, finance and insurance and professional services sectors expanded by 4.0 per cent year-on-year basis in the third quarter. 
All sectors within this group posted growth during the quarter.
The remaining group of services sectors - accommodation and food services, real estate, administrative and support services and other services sectors- grew by 9.2 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, faster than the 7.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter.
Most sectors within the group expanded during the quarter, as activities in these sectors continued to be supported by the lifting of domestic and border restrictions.
Growth in the food services sector was bolstered by COVID-19 restrictions which had dampened activity in the sector in the third quarter of last year. 
Despite the ""strong"" GDP report on Friday, ING's senior economist Nicholas Mapa said he expects Singapore's growth to slow down in the fourth quarter, with signs pointing to even faster inflation coupled with global trade softening on recession fears.
Echoing that, OCBC's chief economist Selena Ling said the growth prognosis is for “below trend growth” in 2023.
""Notably, the mention of the drag on economic activity from the globally synchronised tightening in monetary policy will intensify, and growth in our major trading partners will slow to below trend but stay positive, suggests that prospects for Singapore’s manufacturing and some trade-related sectors have dimmed,"" she wrote in an analysis.
The mitigating factors, she added, are continued resiliency in domestic-oriented and travel-related sectors, underpinned by strong household balance sheets and a tight domestic labour market which should see sustained wage growth."
Airfares to Asian destinations surge amid strong demand for year-end travel ,"Prices of one-way air tickets to South Korea from Singapore have gone up by 78 per cent for the December holiday season compared to the same period pre-pandemic, says Traveloka. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/asia-travel-airfare-prices-japan-taiwan-december-holiday-season-3006221,"SINGAPORE: Travellers booking air tickets from Singapore to some Asian destinations are paying much more for the coming December holiday season compared to the same period before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, travel platforms said on Thursday (Oct 13).
This comes as several popular destinations, including Japan and Taiwan, recently reopened their border to tourists after two-and-a-half years of travel restrictions.
Prices of one-way air tickets from Singapore to Seoul have surged by as much as 78 per cent for this year-end period compared to 2019, according to Traveloka. 
When CNA checked flight comparison website Flightscanner on Thursday, the cheapest available itinerary to South Korea for Dec 19 to 31 cost S$664. This is for a direct roundtrip on budget airlines Scoot as well as T’Way Air, which started routes between Singapore and Incheon earlier this year.
Roundtrip fares on full-service carriers Korean Air and Singapore Airlines cost at least S$1,263 and S$1,924 respectively.
According to Traveloka, fares from Singapore to the Philippines have gone up by 70 per cent, while it costs about 47 per cent more to fly to Thailand. The costs of flights to Indonesia have increased by 43 per cent.  
“Our users are telling us that they want to travel again and we have been seeing a steady uptick of bookings on our platform,” said Traveloka president Caesar Indra, adding that the post-pandemic world will “continue to be dynamic”.

Expedia observed a similar trend. 
Average air ticket prices to Malaysia for the year-end holiday have gone up by up to 50 per cent, it said, while prices to Bangkok have increased by more than 25 per cent. 
And although ticket prices to Japan have gone up as well, the increase has not been as much as with other Asian destinations, noted the travel platforms. 
It costs about 15 per cent more on average to fly to Tokyo this December holiday compared to the same period in 2019, according to Expedia. 
Flightscanner lists direct roundtrip fares to Tokyo for at least S$1,043 during the Dec 19 to 31 period, for flights on Japan Airlines’ budget subsidiary ZIPAIR Tokyo.
Expedia Group's Asia head of public relations Lavinia Rajaram noted that many airlines have introduced additional flights to key destinations like Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which will help to drive prices down.
Mr Indra added that larger carriers have raised the capacity of flights to Japan by more than 30 per cent on average, while smaller carriers increased theirs by 10 per cent.
Apart from the easing of border measures, the recent increase in fuel charges is also contributing to higher airfares, she added.

Despite the higher fares, both companies said travellers do not seem to be discouraged from making plans to fly during the year-end period.
Travel searches “surged significantly” after COVID-19 border measures were eased for some north Asian destinations in late September, said Ms Rajaram.
This shows that “vacation-deprived Singaporeans are excited to return to their favourite holiday destinations, especially for the season of Christmas and New Year”, she added.
“Intra-Asia travel to other nearby destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Seoul continues in an upward trend, as convenient holiday options and international corridors for long-haul flights from the US and across Asia.”
She added: “While travellers may be looking for lower cost options when planning travel, we don’t see air ticket price dampening traveller’s interest to travel in the near term.""
Traveloka also observed that a “significant number” of Singapore travellers have made plans for year-end holidays on the platform, Mr Indra said. 
Top destinations include Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines and Japan, he added.
Earlier this month, Singapore's Transport Minister S Iswaran said the air transport sector recovered to about 80 per cent of pre-COVID levels in the first half of 2022.
Changi Airport also began to ramp up operations as demand for flights increased, resuming operations in Terminal 4 in September after it was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The airport also began a phased reopening for Terminal 2, which welcomed arrivals in May and resumed departures on Tuesday.

"Be proactive about dating, say experts, after survey results show many are not doing so","But relying on chance does not necessarily mean expecting to meet a partner without putting oneself “out there”, said the owner of a dating agency.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singles-dating-proactive-apps-agency-3006141,"SINGAPORE: Half of the single respondents in a recent survey said they are not currently dating, but experts urge them to be proactive.
The findings of the 2021 Marriage and Parenthood Survey, which were released on Monday (Oct 10), showed that among those not currently dating, the top reasons cited were having a limited social circle, not having many opportunities to meet potential partners, and their preference to leave dating to chance.
Ms Michelle Goh, owner of dating agency CompleteMe, noted that being approached in the supermarket or on the bus is not common in the Asian culture, reducing the instances of such chances to meet a partner.
But relying on chance does not necessarily mean expecting to meet a partner without putting oneself “out there”, she said.
“People tell me (they) want to leave it to chance and leave it to fate, but, you see, being ‘swiped right’, both at the same time, that's also fate,” she told CNA938’s Asia First. She was referring to mobile dating apps that typically require people to swipe their screens to the right to indicate their interest in another user’s profile.
She added that even when it comes to organised events, there is an element of fate, as it is not possible to know who will attend it - even a potential partner.
The survey also showed that among the single respondents currently not dating, 38 per cent had never dated before.
The survey, which polled more than 5,800 Singapore citizens and permanent residents aged 21 to 45 between February and June last year, was commissioned by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD), a unit under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
FINDING POTENTIAL PARTNERS ONLINE
The NPTD described the proportion of single respondents who have never dated before and are not proactive in dating as “significant”.
Also speaking to CNA938’s Asia First, Dr Mathew Mathews, one of the research consultants for the survey, made a case for looking for potential partners online.
The principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies pointed to survey results that showed among those who were dating, 29 per cent said they met their partner through online channels. This was more than double the 13 per cent in 2016.
“Getting someone else or some other system involved in trying to help you make those connections - you've seen those trends moving up over the years,” he said.

Commentary: Rise in online dating during pandemic may see more serious relationships, marriages in next few years













Dr Mathews noted that with the pandemic limiting the opportunities for people to meet more organically, they were more open to “mediated” ways of meeting people to date.
This played out in the poll – it found that more than half of the single respondents, about 58 per cent, said they were comfortable with meeting a partner through online dating websites or apps, compared to 43 per cent in 2016.
However, they were still most comfortable meeting potential partners through more organic and face-to-face settings, including through social and recreational activities, friends, or through colleagues.
Dr Mathews added that while the proportion of those who are not proactively dating may be considered high, the situation is better than it used to be.
“We've seen that shift coming. Over the years, we look at those polls, we do notice that people increasingly are … not taking the option to say that ‘I'm leaving it to chance’,” he told CNA938’s Asia First.
DATING THROUGH AN AGENCY
Ms Goh said that her agency specialises in speed dating, but also arranges other types of activities for people based on their age.
For instance, those in their 20s and 30s prefer more organic events and those where they get to learn something or take part in an activity, such as going to an escape room or singing karaoke.
One event that was particularly popular was a cruise trip for people in this age.
“You're kind of locked down in a way, there's no way you can escape … (there are) very intensive meet-up (sessions) because we have a range of activities catered for them and then they kind of do all the games and stuff and they really build a relationship,” she said.
For older seekers of love, the firm caters sit-down meals to facilitate deep conversations, she added."
Man loses lawsuit against Tan Tock Seng Hospital and 3 doctors over his mother's death,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sue-tan-tock-seng-hospital-mothers-death-loses-suit-high-court-dismisses-negligence-claims-3005996,"SINGAPORE: A man who sued Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and three doctors over the death of his mother had his case dismissed by the High Court on Thursday (Oct 13). 
Justice Choo Han Teck found that the hospital and the doctors had not been negligent in their treatment of 74-year-old Tan Yaw Lan, who died in May 2018. 
Madam Tan's son Chia Soo Kiang had argued that doctors Dorai Raj D Appadorai, Lee Wei Sheng and Ranjana Acharya had been negligent in diagnosing his mother at TTSH's emergency department and on admission to a ward.
Mr Chia said the doctors had failed to realise that Mdm Tan was having an acute heart attack when she arrived at the hospital. 
Mr Chia also said the doctors and nurses were negligent in taking his mother for a shower against the family's wishes, not resuscitating her promptly after she collapsed and not obtaining consent from Mdm Tan when they stopped her medication for her heart, high blood pressure and hypertension.
Mr Chia sued the three doctors and TTSH for S$800,000. 
Mdm Tan had a history of chronic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stage four chronic kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol and heart failure among other ailments. 
On Apr 20, 2018,  she was taken in an ambulance to the emergency department of TTSH due to a persistent fever. She was diagnosed to have an infection of an unknown source. 
Mdm Tan began to show improvement by Apr 22.
On Apr 23, an intern nurse helped her with showering and was in the midst of dressing her when Mdm Tan went limp and lost consciousness.
Other staff alerted to the incident helped with resuscitation but she did not regain consciousness. She died three weeks later on May 13, 2018. 
Mdm's Tan family had declined to have an autopsy performed; and a coroner’s report produced later stated that Mdm Tan died of ischaemic heart disease with pneumonia - which was likely the source of her infection. 
Her son's lawyer Clarence Lun argued that Mdm Tan had died from an acute heart attack, but Justice Choo said this was unclear.
Mr Lun had relied on the evidence of two experts - a cardiologist and a heart surgeon - to argue that Mdm Tan had type 1 myocardial infarction when she was admitted to hospital.
Type 1 myocardial infarction is an acute heart attack and an emergency with shortness of breath and chest pain as key signs. It requires immediate intervention.
On the other hand, a type 2 myocardial infarction causes a different degree of damage and would be managed by treating the underlying condition.
At the general ward, Mdm Tan was seen by Dr Lee, then a first-year house officer, and Dr Ranjana, a senior consultant. 
Dr Ranjana agreed with Dr Lee and another doctor that Mdm Tan had an infection complicated by other conditions, including type 2 myocardial infarction.
But Dr Ranjana did not feel the need to refer Mdm Tan to a cardiologist then, as the underlying cause of the type 2 myocardial infarction was the infection, which was being treated.

Man sues Tan Tock Seng Hospital, doctors over mother's death after cardiac arrest













In his judgement issued on Thursday, Justice Choo said: ""I am of the view that Mr Lun had misunderstood the medical evidence of both sides in so far as he claims that the doctors at the Emergency Department had been negligent in not recognising that Mdm Tan had a type 1 myocardial infarction.
""The evidence does not support a finding that Mdm Tan was having an acute heart attack on Apr 20, 2018. What is clear to me is that if Mdm Tan did have  a heart attack on Apr 20, it was more likely to be a type 2 myocardial infarction.""
The judge accepted the defendant expert's evidence that Mdm Tan had suffered a cardiac arrest when having her shower, and that was not necessarily due to an acute heart attack. 
The judge also found that Mdm Tan's signs of improvement showed that the approach to treat her underlying infection was working and there had been no signs of an impending cardiac arrest. 
On the claim that the doctors were negligent in changing Mdm Tan's medication, Justice Choo said that Mr Lun had not presented any evidence that continuing the medications would have prevented Mdm Tan's collapse. 
Dr Dorai was the consultant on-call when Mdm Tan was warded, and it would have been his duty to advise and obtain consent on withholding any medication.
But he was not contacted by the on-call team and hence, did not review Mdm Tan.
Justice Choo added: ""The plaintiff’s claim that TTSH was negligent in taking Mdm Tan for her shower is similarly without basis.
""First, Mr Lun submits that the hospital ought to have obeyed the family’s instruction not to have Mdm Tan take her shower. The only evidence he has is the hearsay evidence of the plaintiff that Mdm Tan was old-fashioned and did not believe in having a bath or shower when ill.""
The intern nurse also testified that Mdm Tan had readily agreed to a shower on Apr 23, 2018. 
The claim that TTSH was slow in its efforts to resuscitate Mdm Tan was similarly without merit, said the judge. 
""When a patient who has the kind of chronic ailments that beset Mdm Tan for so long dies suddenly, one might be forgiven for focusing, with hindsight, to see a connection between those ailments and the death,"" said Justice Choo.
""But what Mr Lun and his experts are doing is quite the opposite. They are saying that given  Mdm Tan’s conditions, the defendants ought to have been soothsayers and foresee her cardiac arrest.""
In closing the judgement, Justice Choo also observed that Mdm Tan's estate would have received S$15,000 for bereavement and S$10,000 for funeral expenses under the Civil Law Act. 
""Given the figures, this claim should have been brought in the Magistrates’ Court — not even the District Court,"" he said.
""As it turned out, that does not matter as it would have failed in any court."""
"Tree that fell in Marsiling Park and killed jogger was infested with termites in rare case, court hears",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/marsiling-park-tree-fell-killed-jogger-loke-xiao-li-dag-infested-termites-rare-case-coroner-court-nparks-3005946,"SINGAPORE: A tree that fell in Marsiling Park and fatally pinned a jogger under it in February last year was infested with a type of underground termite in a rare case, a coroner's court heard on Thursday (Oct 13).
Ms Loke Xiao Li Dag, a senior technical coordinator at CNA studio, had died aged 38 after being pinned by the tree on the morning of Feb 18, 2021.
The inquiry into her death opened on Thursday, with an investigating officer and a director from the National Parks Board (NParks) taking the stand. Ms Loke's parents and brother sat in the hearing, with her father placing his arm around his wife for most of the hearing.
NParks' group director of the streetscape division, Mr Oh Cheow Sheng, testified that the 20m-tall Araucaria excelsa tree was found to be infested with a subterranean species of termite after it fell.
The termites had entered the tree trunk from below the ground and did not leave any externally visible sign, said Mr Oh.
As the living tissue of part of the tree was still functioning, water and nutrients could be sent to the upper part of the tree, so the foliage did not show any sign of poor health, he said.
Mr Oh explained at length the levels of inspection that NParks has for its trees. NParks manages about six million trees in Singapore, including about two million that are planted in parks, roads, state land and in urban areas.
NParks' inspection regime is aligned with best management practices of the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), the largest professional body for tree management in the world, said Mr Oh.
There are two levels of inspection by NParks: First, a visual tree assessment called a VTA that involves a detailed visual inspection of an individual tree based on a comprehensive checklist.
The second level of inspection is an advanced inspection that is more rigorous and stringent as well as invasive. Advanced inspections are conducted only in certain conditions, including if a VTA reveals external signs and symptoms of poor tree health or internal defects.
Mr Oh explained that advanced inspections are not a blanket first measure for trees as it is very costly and it is neither practical nor financially feasible to do so.
In the past 12 years, there have been only three cases of ""tree failure"" where trees fell because of subterranean termite infestation, said Mr Oh.
None of these were Araucaria trees, which was the tree that fell on Ms Loke. Araucaria trees are not susceptible to termite infestation, he said.
SPECIFIC TREE FOUND TO BE HEALTHY IN LAST INSPECTIONS
The specific tree was last inspected in April 2020, with a VTA conducted before that in 2018 and 2016. The tree inspection forms for each of these inspections did not record any external sign of termites or subterranean termites.
In fact, the tree was recorded to be in healthy condition with excellent rigour, with no decay or cavities and no sign of termite infestation, said Mr Oh. 
As there was no external sign of poor health, NParks did not conduct an advanced inspection, he said.
After the incident, arborists visually inspected other Araucaria trees in Marsiling Park and drenched the root zones with termiticide as a precautionary measure. 
Mr Oh said that the presence of subterranean termites is usually detectable via external signs. The insects would form mud tracks along the trunk of the trees, and a mound can sometimes be found beside the trees.
There will also be faecal pellets and the tree may at times show an overall decline in tree health. However, in this case, there was no such sign.

FAMILY LAWYER QUESTIONS NPARKS GROUP DIRECTOR
Lawyer Azri Imran Tan, who acted on behalf of the family, questioned Mr Oh on how a VTA would help in this case if there were no visual cues.
Mr Oh said that there would be signs in most cases, repeating the possible signs he had just mentioned.
""If the termite bore into the core which is the dead wood that they eat, how then can there be signs of external cues or symptoms? Because if it's attacking only from the inside, you can't see what's outside,"" said Mr Tan.
""A tree typically if it's weakened will show signs of stress,"" said Mr Oh. He said there will be signs especially if the tree is stressed during hotter, drier weather.
""But if for some reason there is more rainfall in that period, the tree has accumulated enough moisture, it may not show that kind of symptoms during that kind of transition period,"" said Mr Oh.
Asked how common this kind of termite infestation is in Singapore, Mr Oh said there were only three cases in the past 12 years where trees fell directly because of termite infestation.
""Of these three cases out of a managed population of two million, none (was) the Araucaria. This is the first case,"" said Mr Oh.
He said that NParks has brought down the number of tree failures over the years, from about 3,000 cases in the year 2000 to the current figure of 300 to 400 a year, or almost 80 to 90 per cent reduction in tree failure over the years.
He said this was an extremely uncommon event, where a combination of factors ""resulted in a very rare situation"" where the tree is structurally compromised and weakened but did not show any signs or symptoms.
Mr Oh also said it was not feasible to totally eliminate the risk of termite infestation for two million trees, but said an infested tree would typically have symptoms and NParks can then intervene in a timely manner.
The inquiry continues."
Swinger couple fined over husband's photos of wife posing nude in public,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jeffrey-chue-tze-jeong-nguyen-thi-anh-thy-swingers-swinging-couple-nude-photos-public-undertable-swingers-communityplaces-3005876,"SINGAPORE: A ""swinging"" couple who took nude photos in public places on 18 occasions and offered paid subscriptions for nude content was fined by a court on Thursday (Oct 13).
Jeffrey Chue Tze Jeong, 50, was fined S$14,000 while Nguyen Thi Anh Thy, 30, was fined S$9,000.
Chue pleaded guilty to three charges of conspiring to take photos of his nude wife in public, uploading obscene images to Twitter and obstructing justice by claiming he had lost his phone. Another two charges were taken into consideration. 
Nguyen pleaded guilty to two charges of appearing nude in public and obstructing the course of justice. Both paid their fines in full.
The court heard that the couple was part of a community of ""swingers"" between December 2019 and May 2020.
According to court documents, those who subscribe to a ""swinging"" lifestyle typically have more than one sexual partner, drawn from or outside of the community.
The couple was first introduced to the community through a website called the Undertable Swinger's Community (USC) in December 2019. It is an online membership-based platform for swingers, where patrons post pictures and videos of their swinging experiences.
Around Jan 9, 2020, Chue and Nguyen took photos of a ""sexual experience"" with a third person at a hotel, and posted them on USC.
These were ""well-received"" by the community and led to the couple gaining many followers, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran.
POSTING CONTENT TO STAY POPULAR
In order to maintain their popularity on the USC website, Chue began posting content of Nguyen in various stages of nudity, with her consent.
She appeared nude in public on 18 occasions between January 2020 and May 2020, at multiple locations in Singapore. These included supermarkets in Great World City, IMM Jurong and Geylang; a Toast Box outlet at VivoCity; as well as the vicinity of the ArtScience Museum, Haji Lane and Mount Faber.
To garner more followers and to become USC's ""number one couple of the year"", Chue set up a Twitter account around February 2020 and uploaded watermarked photos of his wife in varying stages of nudity.
Chue used the Twitter account, which was made public sometime before May 2020, to entice followers to subscribe and pay for more content of Nguyen, via a private Telegram chatroom.
From this, he made US$7,805.73 (S$11,207) in a PayPal account and S$1,375.44 in a bank account.
On May 16, 2020, the police received a report about a woman exposing herself in public. An attached video, which showed Nguyen at Great World City flashing her chest, had been disseminated to the public by unknown parties two days before.
The police began investigating the couple and arrested them on May 18, 2020. They raided their home on suspicion of prostitution-related activities.
LIED TO POLICE
While giving a statement to a police officer, Chue lied about the whereabouts of his phone. He claimed he had lost it after visiting Great World City, and said he suspected that a person had picked up the phone and posted the video online. 
The couple lied because they were worried over the phone containing several pictures of themselves.
But at the same time, they did not want to delete the contents of the phone as the compromising photos of Nguyen held ""sentimental value"" for both of them, the court heard.
The phone had actually been placed in a bag with a padlock, and passed to a friend for safekeeping. It was eventually retrieved and surrendered to the police in June 2020.
The prosecutor Mr Sukumaran asked for a fine of S$11,000 for Chue and S$8,000 for Nguyen. He said Chue went to the trouble of designing a business plan with subscription options to monetise his wife's nude media.
They also repeatedly had Nguyen appear nude in public so that provocative photos and videos could be captured, said Mr Sukumaran.
ACCUSED IS A FAMILY MAN: LAWYER
Lawyer Tito Isaac said Chue was a first-time offender and a loving husband, devoted father and family man.
He described the couple's swinging activities as a ""hobby cum passion"".
Nguyen's lawyer Paul Loy said the couple had lied about the phone as they were concerned about ""potential exposure from further leaks of what they say are their private and sentimental documents"".
The photos were not taken to be leaked to the public at large - ""the point was to document their own personal journey of discovery"", said the lawyer.
Mr Loy said the couple have learnt their lesson and completely left their swinging lifestyle behind.
In sentencing, District Judge Janet Wang said: ""The choice of one's lifestyle, conventional or otherwise, is a personal and private matter.""
However, when this encroaches into public spaces and involves an ""overt expression of moral perversion or corruption"" as in the case of Chue and Nguyen, deterrence must feature in sentencing, she added.
""It is irrelevant that the platform caters to consenting parties,"" said Judge Wang. ""The objection lies in the obscene nature of the materials being disseminated on the platform. That the obscene materials were circulated to a limited segment of society does not (detract) from the potential of (harm) to a wider public.""
She said it was equally aggravating that Chue capitalised on the obscene material and applied entrepreneurial skills to accrue financial gain.
The judge said she had ""little empathy"" for both accused, as they went into ""this enterprise with their eyes open"" and should have been ""alive to the risk of dissemination"".
The penalties for appearing nude in a public place are a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to S$2,000, or both.
For obstructing the course of justice, a person can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.
For transmitting obscene images by electronic means, an offender can be jailed for up to three months, fined, or both."
"First of 3 BTO projects at Ulu Pandan to have 1,330 flats, sky jogging track, wellness trails","In total, HDB will launch around 3,000 BTO flats across three housing projects in the eastern half of Ulu Pandan. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/first-three-hdb-bto-projects-ulu-pandan-east-1330-units-3000-total-3004211,"SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will launch its first Build-to-Order (BTO) project at Ulu Pandan - comprising 1,330 three- and four-room flats - in the November 2022 sales exercise. 
The development will be the first of three in Ulu Pandan's eastern half, which will have about 3,000 BTO flats in total, the HDB said in a press release on Thursday (Oct 13). 
The launch comes after plans for the development of the site were revised following feedback from nature groups and the public, as well as findings from environmental studies.
The 33ha Ulu Pandan estate, which is the size of about 46 football fields and bounded by Commonwealth Avenue West, Ghim Moh Link, Ulu Pandan Canal and Clementi Road, is where Dover Forest is located.
While Ulu Pandan had been zoned for residential development since 2003, announcements to develop the area in 2020 raised concerns from nature groups and sparked a debate over balancing development with nature conservation.

The authorities sought public feedback on an environmental study from December 2020 and March 2021 and decided to develop the eastern half of Ulu Pandan for public housing while leaving the western half as it is in the medium term.
Plans for the western half, considered to be richer in biodiversity with more threatened flora species, will be revisited in about a decade.

According to the study's findings, the eastern half of Ulu Pandan comprises a few large trees that are likely remnants of past plantings, none of which are native species.
Even then, the HDB's plans for the eastern half of Ulu Pandan will still incorporate plenty of green features.
HDB said in its press release: ""Ulu Pandan housing developments, which are located within the Health District @ Queenstown, will be designed with a myriad of facilities and nestled within lush greenery to support the physical, social and mental well-being of residents.
""These include approximately 5ha of greenery, comprising a linear park along Ulu Pandan Canal and a park with natural stream on the eastern side.""

GREEN FEATURES 
The development will include roof gardens, rain gardens and trails that snake through greenery, and a green corridor. 
The trails that lead through the estate are meant to enhance residents' well-being and to provide connectivity throughout.
A 1.6km restorative trail, for example, will link residents to Ulu Pandan Park Connector.
The therapeutic trail will have a therapeutic garden where residents can garden or enjoy nature. The trail was also designed to allow users, particularly those with dementia and their caregivers, to navigate easily and safely.
Other green features include a terraced rain garden, which will mitigate the level difference between Commonwealth Avenue West and Ulu Pandan estate.
The estate will also have a 1.2ha park that will be connected to HDB blocks. The park, which also features a walking trail, will retain most of its original flora and fauna, with enhancements to an existing natural stream that connects Commonwealth Ave West and Ulu Pandan Canal. 
HDB is also working with water agency PUB and the National Parks Board to establish a green corridor which will facilitate wildlife movement along Sungei Ulu Pandan.

CONNECTIVITY 
As Singapore's first car-lite HDB precinct, Ulu Pandan will have roads at the perimeter of the precinct, segregated from the main pedestrian walkway. This will let residents move about safely on foot. 
There will also be a network of walking and cycling paths for access to the neighbourhood centre and key amenities in Ghim Moh via the Park Connector Network. 
The first project at Ulu Pandan will be located close to Dover MRT, which will have a commercial node nearby that can provide amenities such as shops, supermarkets, and eateries for residents. 
A fitness trail will connect the terraced rain garden, roof gardens and fitness stations. Apart from that, there will be a 600m jogging track connecting three housing blocks via sky bridges on the 34th storey.

"Man who presented himself as 'lawyer' of Benjamin Glynn claims trial, remanded for psychiatric evaluation","Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman, who is contesting charges for not wearing a mask in public, first appeared in court last year with British national Benjamin Glynn. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/abdul-rashid-abdul-rahman-kingdom-filipina-hacienda-benjamin-glynn-lawyer-claim-trial-no-mask-public-3005671,"SINGAPORE: A man who had previously claimed to be an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"" claimed trial to two charges of failing to wear a mask while in public on Thursday (Oct 13). 
But he was later ordered by the judge to be remanded for psychiatric evaluation after his evidence was found to be ""incoherent"". 
Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman, 57, first appeared in court with British national Benjamin Glynn last year. Glynn, known for not wearing a mask in public, was jailed for six weeks after being convicted of failing to wear a mask, public nuisance and using threatening words towards a public servant in August last year after a one-day trial.
When Glynn was charged at the State Courts, Abdul Rashid, a Singaporean, had appeared as his lawyer but was turned away for inappropriate attire. 
Abdul Rashid later said he did not have a licence to practise but was an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"".

He currently faces two charges for flouting COVID-19 regulations by failing to wear a mask inside and outside the State Courts on Jul 2 last year, and in East Coast Lagoon Food Village on Mar 19 last year.
On the first day of his trial, Abdul Rashid, who appeared in court unrepresented, alternately claimed that he had a heart condition and that the authorities who investigated him had no authority to do so as he was a ""private, sovereign citizen"". 
Four prosecution witnesses, including an investigation officer and an auxiliary police officer, were called to testify. 
The auxiliary police officer testified that on Mar 19 last year, Abdul Rashid was seen without his mask at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. The officer, Mr See Zhi Wei, said that he was deployed to the food centre after Abdul Rashid allegedly failed to wear his mask after several reminders. 
Abdul Rashid had been seated at a table waiting for his food, according to Mr See.

In response to reminders, Adbul Rashid allegedly said the officer had ""no right to intrude"", recalled Mr See. 
""He claimed that he was an ambassador of a Philippine country while he had political exemption.
""The subject reacted aggressively towards my SDA (Safe Distancing Ambassador) officer, and said, 'who are you, who are you',"" Mr See testified. 
After Abdul Rashid's food arrived, the officers observed him for around 20 minutes until he left, still without his mask on. Mr See then asked for Abdul Rashid's particulars, which the accused gave along with what appeared to be a foreign driving licence from a Philippines ""kingdom"".  
An SDA who took the stand testified that he saw Abdul Rashid in front of a satay stall without his mask. Only after his third reminder from the SDA did Abdul Rashid allegedly wear his mask. 
Abdul Rashid also presented what appeared to be diplomatic credentials and invoked his diplomatic status in a 14-page document. 
Asked what this document was, the SDA replied: ""Subsequently, I learnt that it was the constitution of (a) microstate based in southern Philippines."" The SDA clarified that he understood this to be a small, unrecognised territory. 
The accused also threatened the ambassadors with a lawsuit, according to the SDA. 
In his cross examination of this SDA, Abdul Rashid claimed to have produced a letter with his health condition during the encounter. 
""Why are you forcing me to put on the mask when I was sitting with family ... you approached me when we were sitting to continuously put on the mask.
""You know putting on mask from morning until evening makes us suffocated, why you force us to put on mask?"" Abdul Rashid asked. 
However, the SDA denied having seen such a letter, and that he only saw diplomatic credentials which were ""later determined to be unrecognised"". 
Abdul Rashid replied: ""The thing is we do not ask for recognition, just acknowledgment for our sovereign identification."" 
After the prosecution wrapped up its case, Senior District Judge Bala Reddy asked Abdul Rashid to enter his defence. 
Abdul Rashid took the stand and proceeded to read out from documents, but was asked by the judge to clarify his defence. 
The accused replied his defence was that he had a heart condition with a memo from the Changi General Hospital, prompting the judge to ask if he was ""abandoning"" what he previously said about being a sovereign citizen. 
The judge noted that the two defences were ""inconsistent"".
""One is that the law does not apply because you are a private sovereign (citizen), if that is so, how does the medical memo become relevant?"" asked the judge. 
Less than half an hour into the defence, the judge called for a halt to the proceedings. 
Addressing Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh, the judge said: ""I find it very difficult to follow the evidence ... given it's quite incoherent. I would like your assistance (in) how the court should proceed because now he comes to a stage where he says ... he (is) taking the rap for (another) person, it's best that his capacity to plead, fitness to plead be determined.
""It was not apparent at the beginning of the proceeding but now it's becoming clear to me that we may have to assess his fitness to plead.""
The trial was then stood down for two hours. When it resumed, Deputy Public Prosecutor Koh told the court: ""The accused has made certain comments which appear to be incoherent. In particular, he said a person named Abdul Rashid bin Abdul Rahman is a dead entity as we understand and the person in the dock is merely representing the dead person to speak in court.
""There are ... some concerns that he may not be able to follow proceedings and make his defence."" 
The prosecution applied for Abdul Rashid to be assessed by a medical professional. 
Senior District Judge Reddy agreed and ordered that Abdul Rashid be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks for psychiatric evaluation. 
The judge adjourned the case to Oct 27."
Fresh chicken from Malaysia returns to Singapore after 4 months,"The fresh chicken is likely to be 25 per cent more expensive than before, according to suppliers.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fresh-chickens-malaysia-ban-partially-lifted-singapore-3005581,"SINGAPORE: Fresh broiler chicken made a return to supermarkets and wet markets in Singapore on Thursday (Oct 13) afternoon – just days after Malaysia partially lifted its export ban.
The chicken is likely to be 25 per cent more expensive than before, according to suppliers.
Hawkers and caterers told CNA that they are in no hurry to get their hands on the fresh meat, despite potential pent-up demand over the past four months due to Malaysia's ban on live chicken exports.
Mr Muhammad Firdaus, owner of Pasar Vibes Chicken in Jurong, said he is not rushing to place his usual daily order of 20 chickens from suppliers, especially if prices are set to increase. 
“People will think twice before they buy,” said Mr Firdaus, adding that he will wait and see if his customers are willing to fork out more for the fresher option.
The Malaysian government had earlier banned the export of up to 3.6 million chickens per month from Jun 1, in its efforts to tackle supply and pricing issues for chicken in the country.
The ban was implemented following complaints of supply shortage and price increases of chicken, with some traders selling their poultry above the price ceiling to cover their costs.
Before the ban, about one-third of Singapore's chicken supply came from its neighbour across the Causeway.

MIXED FEELINGS
Some sellers are unsure if the partial lifting of the ban to only about half of Malaysia's usual export volume, or 1.8 million chickens, will help their businesses. 
Hua Sheng Chicken owner Luo Jing Xian said the limited supply could see prices go up further, by 30 to 40 per cent. 
One hawker, who did not give his name, said the supply is not enough for the entire market. 
“We have no way of competing with bigger players,” he added. “The more we compete, the higher the prices rise, we will be worse off.""
Katong Catering director Wayne Heng hopes that the return of fresh chicken meat would lower the demand and prices of frozen birds.
“Compared to the rest of the market users, we do not need to use fresh chickens. We are mainly using it for curry chicken or chicken rendang, so it is heavier on the taste, but you cannot really taste the difference,” he added. 
“Perhaps when they have more supply and prices are stable, then we will make the swap.”

REINSTATING SUPPLY LINES
However, there are some who were happier with the return of live chickens from Malaysia. 
One hawker, who also did not give his name, will buy the fresh chicken when they are made available here, adding that “some people don't like the taste of frozen chicken”.
Meanwhile, grocery stores are getting ready to place their usual orders.
Supermarkets contacted said they will be reinstating these supply lines as soon as possible, and are in the midst of confirming a timeline with their suppliers.
For now, they are still getting their supplies from countries such as Thailand and Brazil.
A representative from NTUC FairPrice said: “As a major food retailer, we will continue to employ our ongoing strategy of source diversification to protect consumers from supply disruption.”

Tan Tock Seng Hospital boosts community care for psychiatric patients,"Community nurses making their rounds also keep a lookout for those who may have mental health needs, which allows for early intervention and access to specialist care.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-community-nurses-ttsh-tan-tock-seng-hospital-psychiatric-care-3005531,"SINGAPORE: Two years ago, Madam Lu was helpless when her elderly mother refused to step out of her house to seek medical care after hearing voices in her head that threatened to kill her.
“She got a strong belief that someone is trying to take over the house and kidnap her or kill her. So she's not leaving the home at all. That made it really very difficult, very helpless (for me), I didn’t know where to get help from,” Mdm Lu said as she recounted her experience to CNA.
Help came for both mother and daughter after a team from the Silver Generation Office (SGO) noticed her deteriorating mental condition.
Shortly after, Mdm Lu was referred to specialists at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).
The visits to Mdm Lu and the subsequent referral to doctors were part of a community care programme by TTSH, in which community nurses making their rounds also keep a look out for those who may have mental health needs.
“On top of physical assessment and vital signs monitoring, we also look out for their mental well-being and detect issues such as low moods and coping issues, behaviour, and interaction with us and their caregivers, and watch out for any red flags,” said Ms Grace Lai, a TTSH community nurse.
Mdm Lu’s 86-year-old mother was assessed to have a delusional disorder and put on medication, while nurses gave Mdm Lu advice on providing care.
“Her condition was nearly out of control, she would shout or scold, sometimes hyper (for) 24 hours, non-stop. And that really affected a lot (of us), including the neighbours,” Mdm Lu said. “So, it's great that this healthcare team is here to help us, and after medication, (my mother) actually did see improvement.”
















Together with community partners such as SGO, TTSH's community health team has helped around 100 patients like Mdm Lu since the hospital rolled out the pilot programme a year ago.
INTEGRATING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH
Under the programme, the team provides community aftercare, integrating both physical and mental care at the homes of patients who have been discharged from hospital.
“For people with chronic medical conditions, a lot of them have a higher incidence of having mental health problems as well,” said Dr Megan Chan, a consultant at TTSH’s psychiatry department.
“The team also helps evaluate whether a patient has any psychiatric problems… which they will highlight to us and deliver simple interventions. Should the cases be more complex, then they will be brought back to us in the hospital.”
Apart from those transitioning from hospital to home, around three in 10 patients under the care model were referred from community partners – when social workers or volunteers make their own rounds to check on residents, and spot those who may have mental health conditions.
“They are really important because they are like our eyes and ears in the community,” said Dr Chan.
A majority of cases were those with depression, anxiety, or adjustment issues - conditions that might prevent patients from adjusting to new diagnoses or medications, thus affecting their moods or their motivation to get better, said Dr Chan.
In the case of Mdm Lu’s mother, her mental disorder led to an eating disorder as she thought that her food was being poisoned. This drastically affected her food intake, as she would only finish a quarter of a meal, and further worsened her condition, before the community health team stepped in.
MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR SENIORS
Dr Chan said that the team, set up in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, was timely due to the increasing number of people seeking mental health advice and treatment.



















Singapore looking at tiered system for mental health services to cater to different individuals



















From Moulmein-Cairnhill to Somerset, initiatives in Singapore aim to improve mental health among different age groups













The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that a study reported a stark increase in feelings of isolation for older Singaporeans during the pandemic, especially for those living alone, and added that social isolation is often associated with negative mental health outcomes.
“In recent years, we've seen an increase in seniors and caregivers requesting mental health support,” said Mr Tan Peng Heng, head of the Bishan-Toa Payoh SGO satellite office.
SGO is the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care, which has 20 offices across Singapore to look out for seniors and connect them with the right information and care services.
“Mental health problems already exist but with awareness and house visits, we see and detect more cases, then we start referring them to support groups and partners,” Mr Tan said.
“We're talking long term because mental health issues are not short term, they are long term. Some could be quite mild, if you can intervene to help them recover,” he said. “But those that are more serious, and need long term care, the right support is quite important moving forward.""
HELP ALSO AVAILABLE FOR CAREGIVERS
Along with patient care, the TTSH team also monitors if caregivers are coping well or experiencing burnout.
“Caregivers do feel the stress of having to manage patients or elderlies, sometimes even to the extent of having depression,” said Dr Chan. “So our team will try to advise the caregivers, and if necessary… bring the caregivers to the hospital for consultation or refer them to one of our primary care partners.”
Community nurses receive training every three months to refresh their skills in handling psychiatric patients with an aim to better integrate care. They also consistently enhance their skills in assessing mental health conditions, and guiding caregivers such as Mdm Lu.
“I will update (my mother’s) condition to the nurse. And then the nurse will feedback to the doctor. And also give me some advice. She's more calm now and not so easily agitated, and it's more easy to communicate with her,” Mdm Lu said.

"Monitoring brains, offering mid-day yoga sessions: Firms tackle mental well-being of employees","An estimated 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, costing the global economy nearly US$1 trillion (S$1.44 trillion), according to the World Health Organization.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-workplace-cost-depression-3005521,"SINGAPORE: At one firm in Singapore, employees' moods are being monitored as they work, providing insights into when they feel stressed or focus best. 
The study is part of real estate consultancy JLL's efforts to boost mental health at the workplace.
Mr Ben Hamley, JLL's Future of Work lead for Asia Pacific, noted that Southeast Asian countries including Singapore struggle with ""quite a lot of stigma"" surrounding mental health.
""The idea of being open and vulnerable about times that you might be struggling or feelings of mental ill health, anxiety and depression is very misunderstood,"" he said. 
""By giving people insight into the data around when they're feeling stressed, when they are focused the most ... I think we can actually start a much bigger conversation about mental well-being in the workplace all across Asia Pacific.”
















He added that it is important to shape a dialogue in which people feel comfortable talking about their mental well-being. 
JLL is working with bioinformatics firm Emotiv for the study. 
The study aims to uncover factors that allow for optimal work experiences, such as ideal environments for creative tasks and the type of work conditions that can drive collaboration. At the same time, it hopes to use the data to turn the office into an uplifting space.
""We're capturing neuroscientific brain data from individuals while they're actually doing work as they normally would,"" said Emotiv research scientist Nik Williams. 
THE NEED FOR MENTAL WELL-BEING AT WORK
JLL’s push to improve work life comes amid studies showing the cost of poor mental health among employees and the benefits of paying attention to their well-being.
According to a recent McKinsey study, one in four employees worldwide is experiencing symptoms of burnout.
In Asia, that figure is one in three. The study found that poor workplace mental health can lead to costly organisational issues including absenteeism, lower engagement, decreased productivity and increased insurance costs.
In a CNA-commissioned survey of mental health across six Asian societies during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore was the only place where burnout was the leading factor affecting mental health.
This bucked the trend seen in the other places in the survey, where most people pointed to public measures to keep the pandemic under control, such as restrictions on mask-wearing and travel, and financial burden from the loss of income.
Mental health at the workplace is also on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) radar. WHO and the International Labour Organization recently called for concrete actions to address mental health concerns in the working population.
An estimated 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, costing the global economy nearly US$1 trillion (S$1.44 trillion).
Addressing well-being could help not just with the mental health of employees, but with productivity as well. A report by Mental Health Foundation UK found that doing so increases employee productivity by 12 per cent.
CREATING A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT
While JLL has taken to data to improve things, another firm, networking platform LinkedIn, has focused on creating a workplace where staff have the space to unwind. 
There are pool tables, table tennis tables and a gym where classes are offered. Employees are free to take a mid-day break in a way that suits them. 
Ms Sumita Tandon, director of human resources for Asia Pacific at LinkedIn, said that the firm does a survey with employees every quarter and is “intentional” about asking questions on well-being.
From that survey, the company gleaned feedback specific to the office space, which it then took on board to make enhancements.
“We have received feedback about wanting to have more collaborative spaces in the office, or wanting to have more on-site wellness sessions when it comes to mindfulness, when it comes to dealing with young children,” she said.
With hybrid work life now prevalent in firms, LinkedIn also trained managers to deal with the new norm and identify early signs of mental health issues like depression and burnout, as well as fatigue, Ms Tandon added.
One employee who has benefitted is regional account director Madushan Alwis.
“I think taking a breather is something that's really important, especially in a stressful job. It's also important that there are suitable options for that. So over here, it could be taking a break, having a coffee with one of your colleagues or going for a mid-day yoga or meditation session,” he said.
“I think it's important to be able to take 30 minutes to an hour to have that breather in between your workday when you want to create some space in your mind and come back with new energy to really handle the task at hand.""
Ms Tandon believes companies should continue to invest in their employees’ well-being.
“Companies should continue to invest, consult employees and make sure that what you're doing is relevant for them, it resonates with them, and it's helping them whether it is more programs to equip managers or whether it is changes to your physical workspace,” she said.

"Man remanded over bomb threat on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33 hires lawyer, charge amended",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/la-andy-hien-duc-american-remanded-bomb-threat-singapore-airlines-flight-sq33-hires-lawyer-charge-amended-3005546,"SINGAPORE: A man who has been remanded for about two weeks after being charged with making a bomb threat on a Singapore Airlines flight has hired a lawyer.
The case for La Andy Hien Duc, 37, was heard in the State Courts on Thursday (Oct 13). One of his two charges was amended, and his newly hired lawyer Johannes Hadi asked for permission to see his client.
He also asked for permission for embassy staff to see the American.
The prosecution asked for no bail to be offered and did not object to the defence lawyer's requests. The judge gave the orders accordingly.
The accused was first charged in court on Sep 29 over the incident that occurred on flight SQ33 from San Francisco to Singapore on Sep 28.
The first charge was for voluntarily causing hurt to a man by slapping his cheeks, while the second was for using threatening words by stating there is a bomb on the flight, which was heard by the man he allegedly slapped.
On Thursday, the second charge was amended to include two other witnesses who heard him say there was a bomb on the flight.
After the alleged bomb threat, the police were alerted and the plane landed safely at Changi Airport under the escort of Republic of Singapore Air Force fighter jets.
Officers from the Airport Police Division and Special Operations Command’s K-9 Unit, as well as the Singapore Armed Forces’ Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group, were mobilised to investigate the threat, which turned out to be false.
On Thursday, the prosecutor said she had received a report from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Monday. The accused had been remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation at the last mention.
She asked for a two-week adjournment to finalise the charges, and said the prosecution was waiting for the final charging position from the police.
The case will be heard again on Oct 27. 
If convicted of voluntarily causing hurt, he could be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$5,000, or both.
For making a threat causing alarm, he could be fined up to S$5,000."
"Local actor Edwin Goh fined S$6,500 for drink driving, banned from driving for 3 years",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/actor-edwin-goh-charged-drink-driving-3005401,"SINGAPORE: Actor Edwin Goh was fined S$6,500 on one count of drink driving after he pleaded guilty at the State Courts on Thursday (Oct 13). 
Goh, 28, was charged on the same day and appeared in court unrepresented. In addition to his fine, Goh was disqualified from driving for three years.
The court heard that on Sep 6 this year, Goh went to a restaurant in the Golden Mile area and had dinner. He later visited a bar where he drank alcohol. He left in the early morning the next day, intending to go home. 
At about 2.37am on Sep 7, as Goh was driving, he was stopped along Aljunied Road and noted to reek of alcohol. 
A breath analyser test was conducted and Goh was later arrested for drink driving. 
The alcohol in his body was no less than 81 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath, which exceeded the legal limit of 35 mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. 
The prosecutor sought a fine of S$6,500 for Goh, in addition to a disqualification period. He told the court that Goh had no similar previous offences.  
In mitigation, Goh told the court: ""I have spent a lot of time reflecting on my mistake and I understand the gravity of my offence. I realise that this could ruin my future and has the potential to harm others as well. 
""I hope by being compliant to the officers and this being my first-time offence, (this) could be taken into account (and) there could be some leniency shown.""
In reply to queries from CNA, a spokesperson for Mediacorp said the company had spoken to Goh and understands that the incident took place last month.
""He deeply regrets his action and would like to apologise for the mistake. He would also like to assure everyone that this will not happen again,"" said the spokesperson.
""We would also like to emphasise that Mediacorp does not condone any behaviour that runs afoul of the law. We constantly remind our artistes that their fans and members of the public look to them as role models, and they are expected to behave as such. We will continue to counsel Edwin and will also be taking internal action regarding this.""

Goh was awarded the Breakout Star of the Year at the Elle Awards 2012 and was one of the Top 20 Most Popular Male Artistes and was nominated for Most Popular Regional Artiste (Indonesia) in 2014. 
He has starred in local dramas such A Million Dollar Dream, Old Is Gold, and My Star Bride. 
For drink driving, Goh could have been jailed up to a year and/or fined between S$2,000 and S$10,000."
Teen accused of murdering father in Yishun remanded further as court rejects defence's request to see him ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sylesnar-seah-jie-kai-teen-suspect-murder-father-yishun-remanded-further-3005501,"SINGAPORE: A teenager accused of killing his father in Yishun will be remanded further for police investigations after a court granted a request by the prosecution on Thursday (Oct 13).
At the same time, the court rejected the defence lawyer's request to have access to 19-year-old Sylesnar Seah Jie Kai before police investigations are completed.
Seah was charged on Wednesday with the murder of his father, 47-year-old Eddie Seah Wee Teck, between the fourth and fifth floor of Block 653, Yishun Avenue 4 on Oct 10.
The charge sheet for the capital offence did not indicate how the death of the older man was caused.
Defence lawyer Sunil Sudheesan had made three applications for access to his client on Wednesday, when Seah was first charged. He was told to file written submissions and return the next day.
On Thursday, two deputy public prosecutors took on the case and asked District Judge Terence Tay to grant them a further remand of seven days.
The prosecution said the police investigations into ""a very serious charge of murder"" were only at day 3, as Seah was arrested on Monday evening.
""There is much investigations that remain - crucial investigations, the continuation of statement recording, the retrieval of key evidence exhibits, as well as even bringing the accused back to the scene for site revisitation,"" said one of the prosecutors.
""At this stage, we submit it is premature to grant access to counsel, given that we are in (an) infancy stage of investigations.""
He said the law was clear that an accused person would be granted access to counsel ""within a reasonable time"". The issue of what reasonable time entails factors in police investigations and procedures that are required, he added.
""This is necessary in balancing the accused's right to counsel alongside ensuring the public interest in ensuring that police investigations are completed,"" he said.
The defence lawyer tried to ask if his client, who was in court via video-link, had seen the written submissions he had made.
The prosecution objected to this question before confirming that Seah had not seen any of the submissions. Seah was in a red polo tee and wearing a blue mask, with his hair looking untidy.
Mr Sudheesan said the prosecution had not addressed how the defence seeing Seah for one hour would impede police investigations.
He said Singapore's laws are quite clear, that the rights of an accused person start from the day of his arrest.
""The law must protect everybody equally, but protection is only available if persons know what the law is. If laypersons do not know what the law is, they would be disadvantaged when it comes to assisting the police with full investigations,"" he said.
He said he would actually be assisting the police with investigations if his client were to know his possible defences, as the police and prosecution can then come to the correct charging decision.
""In this case, because it's a murder charge, the accused person should be made aware of his rights under section 300 of the penal code, which lists out the various exceptions to murder,"" said Mr Sudheesan.
The prosecutor responded that Mr Sudheesan would have time to speak to his client, but not at this stage.
He said there was no legal requirement for an accused person to be made aware of his defences, or to have access to counsel before any statements are recorded.
He said the prosecution would not object to the application for a Law Society pamphlet of rights to be given to Seah.
""This is a 19-year-old boy,"" replied Mr Sudheesan. ""What is wrong with him knowing his rights? I say you should allow it to advance our justice system. I am disappointed that the prosecution is objecting, that is all.""
Judge Tay agreed with the prosecution and did not grant the defence counsel access. He ordered Seah to be remanded for a week, but asked the prosecution to ensure the pamphlet of rights was given to Seah as soon as possible.
ACCUSED ASKS FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK
At the close of the hearing, Seah raised his cuffed hands and asked to speak, saying this was ""concerning my life"".
""I would like to make an unreasonable request, because I have already provided all the evidence I'm very sure, and I will cooperate in any way possible ... well, the fact is the unreasonable request has to do with the sentencing of my life, it will not make much of a difference in my point of view, because if it's a life sentence ... ""
The judge interjected and asked Seah to stop as he might be going into matters unsuitable to be raised in open court at this early stage.
His case will be heard again on Oct 20. 
If convicted of murder, he could be sentenced to death."
More investment platforms roll out cash management accounts – should you put your money in them?,"Online brokerage Tiger Brokers and private market exchange ADDX are among the investment platforms that have rolled out cash management solutions, which they describe as “low-risk” alternatives to holding cash.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cash-management-accounts-money-market-funds-tiger-brokers-addx-syfe-stashaway-2981956,"SINGAPORE: As investors flock to safety in an uncertain environment, several investment platforms have rolled out cash management accounts as an alternative to holding idle cash in banks.
These accounts – typically made up of money market funds whose yields have moved up alongside rising interest rates – tout projected returns of above 2 per cent, beating regular savings accounts and on par with some fixed deposit rates. They also offer easy withdrawals with no lock-in period.
Online trading platform Tiger Brokers is one of those that have rolled out such an option recently.
Its Tiger Vault, launched last month, allows users to choose from eight money market funds and earn up to 2.8 per cent based on current estimates. Withdrawals can be done anytime, with fund transfers back to one’s bank account taking around one business day.
Ms Grace Yong, Tiger Brokers’ business development director, said investors want safe havens away from volatile markets to park their money, but rising inflation is eroding the value of their cash savings.
Money market funds – mutual funds that invest in debt securities with short maturities and low credit risk, and have yields that tend to track central banks’ interest rates – hence could be an attractive option.
“Money market funds are traditionally regarded as a stable form of investment which offer investors a relatively low level of risk and high liquidity,” said Ms Yong.
“Like all investments, Tiger Vault carries investment risks. But as the underlying funds invest in safe assets like fixed deposits and government bonds, the risk of a negative return on any one day is low.”
Likewise, private market exchange ADDX noticed that more investors are leaving capital idle in their wallets on its platform. While some are waiting for a suitable investment opportunity, others had excess funds after redeeming earlier investments or receiving distribution payouts.
“Some investors … might even transfer the capital out to their bank accounts to deploy in an external cash management solution, before transferring it back to their ADDX wallets for their next investment,” said chief executive officer Choo Oi-Yee.
The platform introduced its own cash management tool in August. ADDX Earn, as it is called, includes two money market funds with weighted average yields to maturity of 2.22 and 2.38 per cent per annum as of end-July.
With the funds targeting low-volatility assets and having weighted average portfolio durations of less than a year, the new tool aims to “withstand short-term volatility while preserving capital”, ADDX said.
A CROWDED MARKET
To be sure, cash management accounts are not new and there are already several options offered by the likes of robo-advisers and brokerages.
Robo-adviser Syfe, for one, has a Cash+ portfolio whose projected yields have gone up in tandem with rising interest rates – from a per-annum 1.2 per cent at the start of the year to 2.3 per cent as of Sep 26.
Cash+ puts investors’ money into money market funds and debt securities with maturities of less than six months, with each maturing at different times, said head of investment advisory Ritesh Ganeriwal.
“As bonds mature, the proceeds are reinvested into new bonds at the prevailing interest rates, which are higher due to the rate hikes. As a result, the overall projected rate increases in tandem with the rate hikes, but may not track it exactly,” he added.
StashAway has made six revisions so far to the yields of its cash management solution. Simple, as the solution is called, currently offers a 2.1 per cent projected return, up from 1 per cent in May.
The robo-adviser also introduced a “slightly higher risk” version of Simple in July, citing demand from customers for medium-term options while maintaining a part of their portfolios in relatively low-risk assets.
Simple Plus – which includes money market funds, as well as short and ultra-short duration bond funds – offers higher projected returns of 3.6 to 4.1 per cent. But bond funds “can experience short-term volatility” so investors must be prepared to hold their cash for at least 12 months, the firm said.
Overall, StashAway said its cash management portfolios have attracted “increased” inflows amid the rise in expected returns.
Syfe noted that inflows into Cash+ “almost tripled” within a week when it first raised its projected returns, with total inflows “rising steadily” to date.
“With the latest hike (in September), we continue to expect similar levels of inflows compared to previous times,” said Mr Ganeriwal.
Over at Tiger Brokers, its product has since attracted about 12,000 users, with assets under management slightly under S$100 million.
“These numbers are very encouraging, and we continue to see the product picking up momentum,” Ms Yong told CNA.

CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?













Experts said that beyond tapping into the current demand for low-risk instruments, the newer players are also interested in offering cash management solutions as part of growing their overall user base and business. 
“For all the players, especially the newer ones, attracting users into their cash management options is not the end,” said Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.
“It’s the possibility of customers pivoting to other instruments or investment solutions within the platform after coming on board,” he added. “It is more of a step to other possibilities.”
The new players are already looking at ramping up their offerings, with Tiger Brokers set to increase the number of currencies that Tiger Vault supports and include more money market funds.
Currently, its users can invest in Singapore-dollar and US-dollar funds without incurring foreign exchange conversion fees. Funds in Hong Kong dollars will be added soon.
ADDX said it is looking beyond money market funds and may consider ultra-short and short-duration bond funds that provide investors with higher returns.
Ms Choo added that demand for cash management tools will be “evergreen”, be it in a risk-off or risk-on environment.
This is because there will always be undeployed capital as investors consider their opportunities. Such idle funds are also coming from multiple sources and at different times, such as investment returns or capital set aside from a regular salary.
“There is a place for cash management solutions in (a) portfolio in any investment environment,” she said.
WHAT RETAIL INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW
Given the potential to earn some returns while enjoying a high degree of liquidity, cash management accounts made up of money market funds may be an option for retail investors in the current uncertain investing environment.
The projected returns are also likely to remain on an uptrend with central banks still on a rate-hike race.
But not all cash management portfolios are the same, with some having minimum investment sums or management fees.
Other factors to consider include credit ratings, number of securities and average maturity which help investors to evaluate risk levels, said Mr Victor Wong, director of wealth management at Financial Alliance.





      Things to consider when choosing a cash management account
  

1. Average credit rating of the underlying portfolio
Simply put, the higher the credit rating, the better the quality of the underlying bonds or securities. 
This in turn translates into a lower default risk in time of market stress, noted Mr Victor Wong, director of wealth management at Financial Alliance.
2. Number of securities
Having more securities will provide better diversification.
“This means there is lesser concentration risk so that one or two defaults would not substantially affect the portfolio,” Mr Wong said.
3. Average maturity or duration
With short-term interest rates rising rapidly, it may be better to stick to cash management accounts that have a shorter duration, said Mr Wong.
This is because such a portfolio will be less sensitive to interest rate movements.
“That is also the reason why money market funds which typically hold securities with maturity less than one year – hence less sensitive to interest rate rise – are deemed less risky than short-duration bond funds which usually have duration (of) more than a year,” he added.
4. Compare historical performances and other factors
Investors should also compare past performances when shopping around.
“A good cash management portfolio should be able to give the same or better return with lower volatility,” said Mr Wong.
Echoing that, Syfe’s head of investment advisory Ritesh Ganeriwal said it is important to look beyond projected yields and assess a product based on its track record and actual net annualised returns.
Cash+, for one, has always achieved its previously projected returns, he added.
StashAway also noted that its Simple portfolio has “never booked a day of negative returns” in the last 12 months despite market volatility.
In addition, the robo-adviser gives “100 per cent of the rebates back” to customers.
“With rebates consistently compounding, you get a far better long-term strategy for your cash management,” said co-founder and chief executive Michele Ferrario.


 Collapse 
Expand






Also, while money market fund offerings are typically low risk, they are not entirely risk free.
Mr Wong explained: “In a normal market scenario where there are no market stress or liquidity crisis, corporates are normally able to make repayment and investors can enjoy the higher yield.
“However, in an environment of extreme market stress, such as the 2008 global financial crisis where many companies fail or default, cash management solutions which hold short-term corporate bonds may suffer some principal loss.”
As such, investing in money market funds is still slightly riskier than other options like the Singapore Savings Bonds and Treasury bills issued by the Singapore Government, as well as fixed deposits, he added.
Prof Loh stressed that cash management accounts are investment products and investors “should not mistake them” as bank deposits despite the high liquidity.
As with all investments, investors should consider the reputation of the company and read the fine print about protection and recourse should things go wrong, he added.
On that, the investment platforms told CNA that they are licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In accordance with the regulator’s requirements, all customer funds are kept separate from the companies’ own assets in separate accounts with custodian institutions.
This means that investors “will always have full access and claim to (their) assets no matter what happens”, said StashAway’s co-founder and chief executive Michele Ferrario.
Likewise, Ms Yong said: “In the unlikely event that Tiger Brokers faces unfortunate circumstances, the assets will either be returned to the investors or transferred to another agent of the customer's choice.”

CNA Explains: What you need to know about the XBB COVID-19 variant,"How widespread is the XBB variant globally and in Singapore? Are you protected from it if you are vaccinated and how effective will the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines be?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-xbb-variant-omicron-bivalent-vaccines-protect-cna-explains-3004006,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (Oct 11) debunked rumours that Singapore is seeing a significant increase in severe COVID-19 cases and deaths due to the XBB strain.
MOH also said that while there has been an increase in local cases driven by XBB, including the post-weekend spike of 11,732 cases on Tuesday, the number of severe cases has remained relatively low. 
So how dangerous is the XBB strain and how effective are vaccines against it? CNA spoke to a few experts. 
















NOT A ""SINGAPORE VARIANT""
The XBB strain, also known as BA.2.10 is an Omicron subvariant that has been detected in several countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Denmark, India, Japan and the United States since August.
Responding to CNA's queries about overseas media calling the XBB strain the ""Singapore variant"" or suggesting that it was first found in Singapore, Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, executive director at A*STAR’s Bioinformatics Institute said that the claim was incorrect.
He explained that the first occurrences of the XBB variant documented on GISAID were already in other countries, a few weeks before the first cases in Singapore.
""The numbers of genomes known for a variant vary greatly between countries simply due to the intensity of the sampling and genomic surveillance strategy,"" he added.
Dr Maurer-Stroh also said that Singapore is among the world's leading nations to sequence virus genomes fast and ""in a smart way selecting quality over quantity"".
""This will amplify visibility of new variants early.""

Bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine available in Singapore Oct 14, three days ahead of schedule













IS IT A CAUSE FOR CONCERN?
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday spoke about the strain, adding that MOH is watching it very closely.
""XBB is demonstrating characteristics that it is dominating over all other sub-variants. It has been detected in many parts of the world but in Singapore is rising very fast - within three weeks from nothing, it is now over half of all the daily cases,"" Mr Ong added.
Dr Maurer-Stroh told CNA that the virus behaves as expected and that new variants will always replace old ones.
He added that the speed of replacement depends on many factors and is not unique to Singapore.
Meanwhile, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that the variant has the potential to replace the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
Dr Leong said that the variant will cause more infections because ""it can outrun and dodge better than the existing strain"".
However, he also said it is not a cause for concern because severe illness numbers are ""not much more"" and within expectations.
Mr Ong also said on Tuesday: ""But so far, what is good is that there's no evidence that it leads to more severe outcomes.""
Based on preliminary local data, XBB cases are not more serious than other Omicron subvariants, said MOH.
HOW VIRULENT IS XBB?
Dr Leong said that it is not clear yet how virulent the XBB variant is, but it is more transmissible and ""out-infecting BA.5"".
MOH said on Monday that the XBB strain is gaining share, with 55 per cent of infection cases comprising this strain. It is a 22 per cent increase from the previous week. 
Dr Maurer-Stroh said that like other variants before, ""a hallmark of new variants like XBB is an accumulation of changes in the spike surface protein"".
""It is like the virus getting a new coat, and our immune system needs to learn again how to recognise it.
""This makes it stealthier but typically not more virulent,"" he said.

HOW EFFECTIVE ARE BIVALENT VACCINES?
Dr Leong said that the bivalent shots are expected to be ""more effective than the ancestral strain-based mRNA vaccine which we have used previously"".
""Effectiveness should be measured against the risk of causing severe disease,"" he added.
Professor Lisa Ng, executive director at A*STAR's infectious diseases labs concurred. She said that the bivalent shots will be more effective than the original vaccine in triggering an immune response against newer COVID-19 variants.
MOH brought forward the administration of the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine to Oct 14, three days ahead of the previously announced date.
“The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine, with the same dosage for boosting,” it said.
“Instead of targeting only the original COVID-19 virus, the updated version also targets the Omicron variant. It therefore will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants. It is proven to be safe and effective,"" MOH added.
HOW PROTECTED ARE YOU WITH THE CURRENT VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS?
Dr Leong said that the vaccine model of either three complete mRNA or Novovax shots or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses is ""still very effective against preventing severe illness"", but he added that those who are unvaccinated are at risk.
Prof Ng also said that vaccination will reduce the probability of contracting severe illness, adding that like all vaccinations, there will be protective effects.
Those aged 50 and above should also receive an additional booster dose between five months and one year from their last dose, to keep up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination, said MOH.
MOH announced last week that the current mRNA vaccines will be replaced by bivalent vaccines, as recommended by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination.

Possible sighting of rare blood moon over Singapore on Nov 8,"The next two total lunar eclipses will only happen in 2025. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/possible-blood-moon-total-lunar-eclipse-singapore-nov-8-3003966,"SINGAPORE: Skygazers in Singapore may be able to catch a glimpse of a rare blood moon next month, the result of a total lunar eclipse. 
The celestial sighting will take place on Nov 8 but it may be challenging to observe the phenomena. 
The Science Centre Observatory said in a Facebook post on Monday (Oct 10) that the total lunar eclipse will begin with a penumbral eclipse at 4.02pm.
This will then be followed by a partial eclipse at 5.09pm before a full eclipse at 6.16pm. However, these stages will not be visible as the moon will only rise at 6.46pm, said the observatory.
By then, the rising moon will appear dark and will only rise to an ""appreciable altitude"" of about 30 degrees by 9pm. 
While the Science Centre Singapore will not be organising an event to observe the eclipse, the observatory said that interested viewers could attempt to view blood moon by themselves. 
Members of the public are advised to head for somewhere with a clear view of the Eastern horizon, which is the opposite of where the sun sets, from 7pm onwards. 
Although equipment is not necessary, viewers may wish to use a pair of binoculars. The moon will likely appear red due to the eclipse and Singapore's atmospheric conditions, said the observatory. 
The full eclipse phase is predicted to end at 7.41pm, followed by the partial eclipse phase ending at 8.49pm and finally the penumbral eclipse ending at 9.56pm. 
The upcoming total lunar eclipse on Nov 8 will be visible in the regions of Asia, Australia, the Americas and the Pacific. 
The previous total lunar eclipse was on May 16 this year, which was visible in the Americas, Europe and Africa. The phenomena lasted for more than an hour, according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data. 
The next two total lunar eclipses will only happen in 2025.

WHAT MAKES THE BLOOD MOON RED?
According to NASA, lunar eclipses occur at the full moon phase when the Earth is positioned precisely between the moon and the sun.
The Earth's shadow falls upon the surface of the moon, dimming it and sometimes turning the lunar surface red over the course of a few hours. Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth, added NASA.  
There are three different types of lunar eclipses - penumbral eclipses, partial lunar eclipses and total lunar eclipses.
Total lunar eclipses are rare. They happen when the moon moves into the inner part of Earth's shadow, which is also known as the umbra. Some of the sunlight passing through the Earth's atmosphere reaches the moon's surface, lighting it dimly. 






      A cable car gondola moves past as the moon is seen during a lunar eclipse, referred to as the ""super blue blood moon"", in Singapore on Jan 31, 2018. Skywatchers were hoping for a rare lunar eclipse that combines three unusual events - a blue moon, a super moon and a total eclipse - which was to make for a large crimson moon viewable in many corners of the globe. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)
    






During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears orange or reddish. NASA said this is because colours with shorter wavelengths, like the blues and the violets, scatter more easily than colours with longer wavelengths, such as red and orange.
These are the wavelengths that make it through the Earth's atmosphere, thus giving the moon its ""blood-like"" appearance. The more dust or clouds in Earth’s atmosphere during the eclipse, the redder the moon appears.
Unlike a solar eclipse, it is safe to look at a lunar eclipse with the naked eye.
The next total lunar eclipse will only happen on Mar 14, 2025 and will only be visible in the Americas, Europe and Africa. 
However, another total lunar eclipse will happen again on Sep 7, 2025. This time, it will be visible in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia."
CNA Explains: What you need to know about the upcoming increase in bus and train fares,"How much more will commuters have to pay for bus and MRT rides? Will fares for students and the elderly go up? And what are the reasons for raising fares?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bus-train-fare-increases-what-you-need-know-3004061,"SINGAPORE: Public transport fares will increase by up to 5 cents from Dec 26 as operators continue to grapple with rising energy prices.
In its annual fare review exercise, the Public Transport Council (PTC) said it would increase fares by 2.9 per cent, after taking into account the need to keep fares affordable for the public while ensuring that the system remains financially sustainable.
Here’s what you need to know about the fare increases.
ADULT COMMUTERS
From Dec 26, adult card fares will increase by 4 cents for journeys of up to 8.2km. For journeys longer than 8.2km, fares will increase by 5 cents.
This means that an MRT journey from Boon Lay to Clementi, where the distance is 8.2km, will be S$1.45 for adult commuters, up from S$1.41 currently.
Taking the MRT from HarbourFront to Paya Lebar, which covers a distance of 11.5km, will cost S$1.64, up from S$1.59.
















STUDENTS, SENIOR CITIZENS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Students and senior citizens holding concession cards will also see a rise in public transport fares. However, the increase will be capped at 1 cent per journey.
This will also extend to concession card fares for low-wage workers and people with disabilities. Introduced in 2014, these schemes are funded by the Government.
Low-wage workers will continue to get discounts of up to 25 per cent off adult fares.
Meanwhile, fares for commuters with disabilities will continue to be pegged to that of seniors, which is a discount of up to 55 per cent off adult fares.
CASH FARES, MONTHLY CONCESSION OR TRAVEL PASS USERS
Prices of monthly concession passes and adult monthly travel passes will remain unchanged.
A hybrid monthly concession pass for primary school students currently costs S$43.50, while that for secondary and polytechnic students is S$54. University students and full-time national servicemen pay S$90.50.
Senior citizens pay S$64 while monthly travel passes for adults cost S$128.
Bus cash fares will also remain unchanged for the third year in a row since 2019.

TRANSPORT VOUCHERS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
A total of 600,000 public transport vouchers worth S$30 each will be given to lower-income households to help them cope with the increase in bus and train fares.
The vouchers can be used to top up fare cards or buy monthly concession passes and must be redeemed by Mar 31, 2024.
Only resident households with a monthly household income per person of not more than S$1,600 will be eligible for the vouchers.
The disbursement of the vouchers will be done in two stages, starting end-December.
In the first stage, eligible households that received the vouchers in the previous year’s public transport voucher exercise will automatically receive a notification letter through the mail, without having to apply.
From early 2023, households that meet the income criteria but did not receive a voucher in the first stage will be able to apply for them online or in person at their local community centres or community clubs.
WHY ARE FARES GOING UP?
The fare hike is necessary to meet rising energy prices, which rose by 117 per cent last year, said the PTC. It also noted increased manpower costs and inflation.
These factors would have allowed for a maximum fare increase of 13.5 per cent under the current fare adjustment formula - the highest quantum since the formula was implemented in 2005.
Both transport operators had applied for a fare adjustment of 13.5 per cent, citing escalating costs as among the reasons.
After taking into account government support for COVID-19 in their latest financial year, SBS Transit’s train segment reported a loss of tens of millions of dollars while SMRT Trains recorded an operating profit of S$16 million.
However, the PTC said it decided to grant public transport operators a fare increase of just 2.9 per cent due to concerns over the rising cost of living. The remaining 10.6 per cent will be carried over to future fare review exercises.
While the fare increase will generate additional revenue of about S$50.3 million a year, PTC said this will not be enough to cover the costs of operating high-quality public transport services.
To cover the increased costs and shield commuters from the brunt of the fare increases, the Government will provide an additional S$200 million in subsidies in 2023. This is on top of the current subsidies of more than S$2 billion per year to run bus and train services."
"Curbs on number of visitors, duration of visits at hospitals and residential care homes as COVID-19 cases rise","The Ministry of Health reminded visitors not to eat or drink in hospital wards or use toilets designated for patients.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-moh-hospital-care-home-visits-limited-3004156,"SINGAPORE: Visitor safe management measures at all hospital wards and residential care homes in Singapore will be tightened for four weeks as community COVID-19 cases rise, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Oct 12).
This is to protect healthcare capacity as well as vulnerable patients and residents, MOH said in a media release.
From Oct 14 until Nov 10, patients in hospitals will only be allowed to have two pre-designated visitors for the duration of their stays.
Only one of these visitors will be allowed at a patient's bedside at any one time.
""Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated patients, and two visitors may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time,"" MOH said.
Visits will be limited to 30 minutes.
In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals' discretion, MOH added.
Residents of care homes, meanwhile, will be allowed to have up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one visitor may visit at any one time with the visit duration limited to 30 minutes, MOH said.
""We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the home for further details,"" the ministry added.
Rules on hospital and residential care home visits were last eased on Sep 1. Since then, hospitals have allowed up to two bedside visitors at any one time during visiting hours, while residential care homes allowed residents to have two visitors per visit with a one-hour cap on each visit.

MOH reminded visitors not to eat or drink in hospital wards or use toilets designated for patients in the wards. Visitors should also avoid sitting on patients' beds.
""In addition, as our hospitals’ emergency departments (ED) are seeing a high number of patients daily, we encourage members of public to only go to the ED for emergency conditions,"" MOH said.
To prioritise emergency department resources for patients who need emergency medical care, the Health Ministry said emergency department patients with non-emergency conditions, including children, may be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment.
MOH added that residential care home visitors should continue to schedule their visits with the home ahead of time, while ensuring that they adhere strictly to prevailing safe management measures within the homes. This includes remaining within designated visitor areas outside wards.
""Visitors to hospitals and homes are to ensure that they are well and are strongly encouraged to test themselves with an antigen rapid test (ART) kit on the day of the visit to their loved ones.
""They must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric,"" said MOH. 
Hospitals and homes have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients, the ministry said.
MOH said that it will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving COVID-19 situation in Singapore.
""We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, and their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions.""
Singapore reported 11,732 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday amid an increase in infections brought about by the XBB strain.
The number of severe cases has remained relatively low, however, MOH said on Tuesday.

"MOH proposing amendments to Healthcare Services Act for 'greater clarity', patients' safety","From Oct 12 to Nov 11, the public is invited to visit www.hcsa.sg to provide their feedback on the proposed changes to HCSA.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moh-proposing-amendments-healthcare-services-act-greater-clarity-patients-safety-3004091,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is proposing several amendments to the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) to better safeguard patient safety and well-being, while enabling the development of new and innovative services, the ministry announced on Wednesday (Oct 12). 
The proposed amendments will also enable patients to benefit from a delivery of healthcare services by licensees under a ""robust regulatory regime"", as well as from ""greater clarity and transparency in healthcare services advertising and modes of service delivery"".
The following are MOH's proposed amendments, as outlined in its press release, and are targeted for implementation in June 2023.
First, the Health Ministry proposes a change to the advertising of healthcare services not licensed under HCSA. 
It proposes that non-HCSA licensees ""cannot claim to treat medical conditions or diseases when advertising healthcare services"". 
Non-registered healthcare professionals who use ""Dr"" in their advertisement of healthcare services must make clear to the public what their qualifications and credentials are. This is so the public are not ""misled"" that the ""Dr"" is someone associated with a general medical practice or has an MBBS degree.

Second, MOH proposes that HCSA licensees are ""not allowed to use terms associated with specialties in their business names if there is no such specialist employed by them"". 
For instance, a clinic cannot be called ""Neurology Clinic"" if there is no neurologist working for the clinic. 
Third, MOH proposes a regulation of different modes of healthcare service delivery. 
This is so the public is aware of the modes of service delivery they can access, said the ministry. 
For instance, a medical clinic can choose ""Permanent Premises"" for its clinic service delivered at its physical premises.
They can choose ""Temporary Premises"" if they provide home visits or community site screenings, and they can select ""Remote"" for teleconsultations. 
Fourth, MOH is proposing an introduction of ""an approval regime"" for the delivery of specified services, such as imaging modalities under the radiological service. 
They are also proposing the appointment of ""clinical governance officers"". 
Fifth, MOH proposes refining the scope of employee background screening according to the degree of risk to patients' safety and welfare. 
And finally, MOH is proposing that it should be allowed to take immediate action to address ""urgent patient safety issues"".
It proposes removing the current 14-day notice prior to modification of licence conditions for groups of licensees in such special circumstances, such as requiring licensees to implement screening requirements for patients and caregivers to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

PUBLIC INVITED TO SHARE VIEWS 
From Oct 12 to Nov 11, the public is invited to visit www.hcsa.sg to provide their feedback on the proposed changes to HCSA.
""The feedback gathered from the public consultation will better inform the implementation of HCSA in subsequent phases,"" said MOH.
The ministry is also seeking views from licensees who have already come onboard HCSA in Phase 1 and healthcare providers who may take up HCSA licences in the future. 
For licensees who are coming onboard HCSA in Phase 2, more details on specific requirements will be provided at the respective service regulation consultations in the next few months, said MOH.
HCSA, enacted in 2020 to replace the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA), is being implemented progressively in three phases which started in January 2022 and will be completed in end-2023."
"Eligible lower-income households to get S$30 public transport vouchers to cope with rise in bus, train fares","Bus and train fares will increase by up to 5 cents from Dec 26 due to rising energy costs, says the Public Transport Council.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bus-train-fare-increase-eligible-lower-income-households-get-public-transport-vouchers-3003881,"SINGAPORE: A total of 600,000 public transport vouchers worth S$30 each will be made available to lower-income households to help them cope with rising bus and train fares which will kick in from Dec 26. 
This comes after the Public Transport Council’s (PTC) decision to increase fares by 2.9 per cent in its annual fare review exercise due to rising energy prices.
The vouchers can be used to top up fare cards or buy monthly concession passes, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the People’s Association (PA) in a joint news release on Wednesday (Oct 12). 
Similar to last year’s Public Transport Vouchers exercise, it will cover resident households with a monthly household income per person of not more than S$1,600. 
The vouchers will be disbursed in two stages. 
In the first stage, households that received the vouchers in the 2021 exercise and continue to meet the income eligibility criteria will automatically receive a notification letter through the mail, without having to apply. This will be done by end-December.
In the second stage, which will start from early 2023, households that meet the income criteria but did not receive a voucher in the first stage can apply for them online or in person at their local community centres or community clubs. 
All vouchers must be redeemed by Mar 31, 2024. 
RISING TRANSPORT COSTS 
From Dec 26, adult card fares will increase by 4 cents for journeys up to 8.2km long. For journeys longer than 8.2km, fares will increase by 5 cents. 
Meanwhile, the increase in concession card fares will be capped at 1 cent per journey to keep fares lower for students, senior citizens, lower-wage workers, and people with disabilities. 
There will be no change to the prices of monthly concession passes, adult monthly travel passes and bus cash fares. 
The overall fare adjustment of 2.9 per cent translates to an increase in fare revenue of about S$50.3 million a year, with SBS Transit Rail and SMRT Trains set to see an increase of S$7.4 million and S$15.4 million in annual revenue respectively.

Fare revenues for bus and Thomson-East Coast Line collected by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will increase by S$27.5 million to sustain the cost of their operations, including service payments to the operators.
However, PTC said the revenues ""will not be sufficient to cover the costs of operating high-quality public transport services"". 
After taking into account government support for COVID-19, SBS Transit’s train segment reported a loss of tens of millions of dollars while SMRT Trains recorded an operating profit of S$16 million in their latest financial year.
Both operators had applied for a fare adjustment of 13.5 per cent, citing escalating costs as among the reasons for the increase. 
To cover the increased costs due to the doubling of energy prices and mitigate the impact of fare increases on commuters, the Government is providing an additional S$200 million in subsidies in 2023. This is on top of the current subsidies of more than S$2 billion per year to run bus and train services.
“The S$200 million support covers the carried-over quantum of 10.6 percentage points and shields commuters from the brunt of the fare increases, given the cost of living concerns,” said the Ministry of Transport in a press release on Wednesday. 
It added that this has enabled adult fare increases to be capped at 5 cents per journey. 
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, PTC chairperson Janet Ang said the council had decided on the 2.9 per cent fare increase to ensure public transport remains affordable while taking into account inflation. 
“We deliberated very hard and debated internally how far should we go - because of public transport operations costs - in order to enjoy the quality of service,” she said.

RISING ENERGY, LABOUR COSTS
The fare hike is necessary to meet rising energy prices, which rose by 117 per cent last year, the PTC said.
Coupled with increased manpower costs and inflation, this led to a maximum allowable fare adjustment quantum of 13.5 per cent according to PTC’s fare adjustment formula. This is the highest quantum generated by the fare formula since it was implemented in 2005. 
However, the PTC said it decided to grant public transport operators a fare increase of just 2.9 per cent due to concerns over the rising cost of living. The remaining 10.6 per cent will be carried over to future fare review exercises.
About 1.8 per cent of household income goes to public transport for an average user, according to the public transport affordability indicator, which is based on data from the Department of Statistics.
With this year's fare hike, and taking into account average wage increases, the PTC said the monthly public transport expenditure for these households is expected to remain at a similar level.
At a press conference on Wednesday, PTC chairperson Janet Ang said the council looks at both the economic situation as well as the percentage increase generated by the fare formula.
“We will digest it together as a community,” she added. 
Transport Minister S Iswaran said in a Facebook post after the announcement that ""fare adjustments are never easy"".
""To keep our public transport system financially sustainable, fares need to be updated to cover the increased costs,"" he wrote.
The Government will cushion the impact with public transport vouchers, concession schemes and subsidies, and ensure that fares remain affordable especially for the vulnerable, he added.

Free public transport for vulnerable groups will create 'financial burden' on commuters or taxpayers: Iswaran













As of last month, public transport ridership has recovered to about 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, said the PTC. 
Last year, bus and train fares in Singapore increased by up to 4 cents, after the council decided to grant the maximum allowable fare adjustment quantum of 2.2 per cent to help operators mitigate the costs of running public transport services. 
This came amid rising operating costs and a drop in ridership due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It marked the first fare increase since 2019, when fares were increased by 7 per cent, or 9 cents per journey, for adult commuters using travel cards. 
During its 2020 fare review exercise, the PTC decided against raising public transport fares due to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on the economy. 
CALCULATING FARE ADJUSTMENTS
In August, the PTC announced that it was in the midst of reviewing the way bus and train fare adjustments are calculated. 
The review of the formula and mechanism for adjusting public transport fares is slated to be completed by the first half of next year. Any change will be applied from the 2023 fare review exercise.
Typically conducted every five years, it aims to examine the effectiveness of the current fare adjustment formula and mechanism, taking into account changes in the public transport industry and commuting patterns.
PTC also said then that it would propose means to better maintain the balance to keep public transport fares affordable while ensuring the financial sustainability of the public transport system."
Jail for driver who evaded LTA officer and returned with boss to remove coal from overloaded truck,"It took a total of five LTA officers and one traffic police officer to finally escort the driver to an inspection centre, with the entire incident lasting more than four hours and involving eight stops.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/driver-overloaded-truck-evaded-lta-officer-return-boss-remove-coal-3003891,"SINGAPORE: When stopped by a Land Transport Authority (LTA) officer on suspicion that he was driving an overloaded truck, a man tried multiple ways to escape before returning to the impounded truck with his boss in order to remove tonnes of coal from the vehicle.
Chong Kong Pooi, 49, was sentenced to a week's jail on Wednesday (Oct 12). He pleaded guilty to one charge each of obstructing the course of justice by removing the coal and another charge of refusing to comply with the LTA officer's instructions for the truck to be weighed.
A third charge was considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Chong, a Malaysian, was working as a driver for Hiap Tat Holdings. On Mar 4 last year, Chong loaded up hard coal into the truck and was driving it from Seletar North Link towards Fort Road for unloading.
At about 3.45pm, an LTA enforcement officer performing checks along Fort Road spotted the tipper truck and suspected it was overloaded, a contravention of a road traffic rule. He followed the truck with his motorcycle and directed for Chong to stop the truck.
The truck was pulled over before the entrance of the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE). The maximum laden weight of the truck was 28,000kg or 28 tonnes, but a card on the truck indicated that it was carrying a load of 36,540kg.
The officer told Chong that the truck was overloaded and said he needed to escort Chong back to an inspection centre for weighing. Knowing that the truck was overloaded, Chong pleaded with the officer not to escort him to the inspection centre.
The officer told him to comply with his directions and they started off in their respective vehicles towards the inspection centre. On the way, Chong called his employer, Mr Chan Je Huat, and told him what happened.
BOSS ASKS HIM TO TRY TO RUN, HE COMPLIES
Mr Chan also knew the truck was overloaded and told Chong to ""just try to run"" first. Chong listened to his boss and made multiple moves in an effort to escape.
He made a sharp turn to exit the MCE tunnel via the Marina Coastal Road exit and stopped his vehicle. The officer questioned him about this and Chong pleaded with him to let him unload the truck before going to the inspection centre.
The officer refused and asked Chong to follow the officer's vehicle. While on the way along Central Boulevard, Chong made a sudden right turn to Marina Gardens Drive, but the LTA officer quickly caught up with him at a traffic junction.
He asked Chong what was going on and Chong said he did not want to drive anymore and wanted to go home. He asked the officer for one more chance, but was declined. Chong then drove off.
The officer gave chase and called his colleagues for assistance. The truck was stopped at the traffic junction of Marina Gardens Drive and Central Boulevard, and the LTA officers seized the keys as they found Chong was driving recklessly. Chong would not cooperate and struggled with the officers before running off towards Shenton Way.
He was apprehended and instructed to sit on the ground. He sat down, but suddenly got up again and got into the truck, where he drove away for the third time under the pretext of retrieving his petrol card.
In an attempt to get away from the pursuing officers, Chong ran a red light and performed an illegal U-turn. A traffic police officer went to help the LTA officers and they managed to stop Chong. Another three LTA officers also arrived and the entire party escorted Chong towards the Inspection Centre.
At Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Chong stopped the truck and claimed there was no more petrol left, even though there was a quarter tank of petrol left in the truck. He was made to continue moving, but again stopped at another junction and refused to drive forward.
Chong later claimed the truck had broken down and could no longer move. The original LTA officer told him he would need to tow and impound the truck and asked him to sign the towing form.
However, Chong refused to sign the form as his boss had instructed him against it. The truck was towed to a car park beside the Land Transport Authority's office in Sin Ming. A note was placed on the truck stating that it was under investigation by the LTA.
CHONG RETURNS TO SCENE WITH BOSS TO FIND THE TRUCK
Later that night, after the LTA officer had left, Chong returned to the area with his boss. The pair drove around to look for the truck and found it.
On his boss' instructions, Chong removed three to four tonnes of coal from the truck to ensure the laden weight was within the acceptable limits. 
The truck was never weighed as the authorities had reason to believe it had been tampered with.
The case was handled by an LTA prosecutor and a deputy public prosecutor. The latter asked for a week's jail for the obstruction of justice charge, noting the amount of police investigative resources channelled into the case. 
However, he noted the early plea of guilt and the fact that Chong had taken instructions from his superior.
The LTA prosecutor asked for three to five days' jail. He said this was not a usual run-of-the-mill case, but was one of the most egregious seen so far.
""There were eight stops that were made from MCE to (the inspection centre).  This whole event lasted for about four hours and 15 minutes. That is a very long time to escort a vehicle from the MCE ... given how big Singapore is,"" he said.
He added that there were five LTA officers and a traffic police officer involved, without even beginning to take into account the resources used in just escorting Chong to the inspection centre. 
Chong's lawyer said a jail term was not appropriate in this case. He said his client was the sole breadwinner of his family, who lives in Malaysia. The offences were committed due to his ""poor judgment calls"" and out of ""misguided loyalty"" to his boss.
He asked for leniency, saying the offences were not committed for personal gain as the company would have been responsible had the truck been weighed and found to be overloaded."
"OnlyFans creator Titus Low fined over obscene content, gets jail for defying police order",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/titus-low-onlyfans-creator-jail-fine-uploading-obscene-content-3003451,"SINGAPORE: Content creator Titus Low Kaide was on Wednesday (Oct 12) fined S$3,000 for uploading obscene photos and videos to online platform OnlyFans. He was also sentenced to three weeks' jail for accessing the website although he was ordered not to do so.
Low, 22, pleaded guilty to one count of failing to comply with a police order by accessing his OnlyFans account when he was under investigation and prohibited from doing so.
He admitted to a second charge of transmitting obscene photos and videos to his OnlyFans account.
Another three charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Low started an OnlyFans account in April last year.
Between then and October 2021, he earned more than US$240,000 (S$345,500) from the platform, after deducting taxes.
He had more than 1,900 active subscribers as of October 2021, and more than 4,000 expired subscribers. 
Investigations against him began when a person filed a police report in September 2021, after finding an obscene video of Low in their 12-year-old niece's mobile phone.
The police took a statement from Low and told him he was not to access his OnlyFans account and the email account linked to it.
Low surrendered his passwords but failed to tell the police that he had a secondary email account linked to the OnlyFans account.
After the police changed his passwords, Low contacted the OnlyFans helpdesk and managed to get access to the account again, by claiming he had been hacked.
He then posted more obscene photos and videos for his paid subscribers.
The breach was discovered when the investigating officer tried to access his OnlyFans account for investigations.
The passwords were changed again, but Low reached out to OnlyFans to get access to his account yet again.
He succeeded and again posted more obscene footage.
KEY ISSUE IS ABOUT LOW WILFULLY DISOBEYING POLICE ORDER: PROSECUTOR
Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran asked for a fine of S$3,000 for the obscene material charge and a jail term of four weeks for defying a police order.
He stressed that the key issue in this case was about Low wilfully disobeying an order by the police not to access his OnlyFans account. After lying to the helpdesk that he had been hacked, he breached the order and profited from it by uploading further obscene material, said Mr Sukumaran.
""This case your honour, is not about the unenforceability of certain provisions, not about the legality of a certain Internet platform. It is not about him being singled out for anything, it's because he wilfully disobeyed a police order,"" said the prosecutor.
LAWYER TRIES TO ASK FOR PROBATION, SAYS LOW IS FIRST ONE PROSECUTED OVER ONLYFANS
Lawyer Kirpal Singh asked for a probation suitability report, or a fine in the alternative. He said Low is a young man currently serving his national service, who had a troubled childhood and did not come from a stable family.
""He had to fend for himself early on, in work, in school, and he was trying to stand on his own two feet quite early on in life,"" said Mr Singh. 
He said Low was suffering from an adjustment disorder as diagnosed by the Institute of Mental Health. The lawyer said this is the first case involving an OnlyFans account, and described how the platform is designed only for adults to enter.
He said there was a mechanism for face recognition to prevent minors from accessing it and that the platform is not an open one.
""So it's very secure in that sense and it's almost between two consenting adults,"" said Mr Singh.
He said there was a broader issue here as consenting adults will time and again transmit potentially pornographic obscene materials to each other.
He gave an example of a boyfriend and girlfriend or husband and wife sharing intimate photos with each other.
""That in itself is technically an offence, but no action is taken,"" said Mr Singh. ""For example, we have a disgruntled, aggrieved boyfriend who then threatens the girlfriend that he will upload the material, then he is charged, but the girlfriend who first transmitted the obscene material herself is not charged.""
He said there was a ""certain anomaly as to why Titus is being selected or picked on"" but said he would not expound on that as it was entirely up to prosecutorial discretion.
As for the police report that prompted investigations, Mr Singh said it is ""the nature of the business"" and that they ""cannot control what happens"" if adult content gets distributed to social media platforms and eventually ends up in a child's phone.
""We accept that's the nature of the business and Internet, but Titus himself was not the one who posted it. I believe at some point he made a police report about it, the fact that his materials were being captured and shared,"" said Mr Singh.
He said it could be disseminated when a paying subscriber takes a video of Low's video on the OnlyFans platform.
He said he asked Low point blank why he defied the police order, and Low told him that he already had prepaid subscribers at that point and felt ""an obligation to continue to supply them content"".
He said he did not think jail was appropriate in this case, saying Low was the first one from OnlyFans to be prosecuted and that there is no yardstick with which he could gauge his actions.
However, he said Low accepted it was a ""stupid thing to do"" and he regrets it.
LOW NOT SHUNNED BY PUBLIC EYE AS DEFENCE CLAIMS, SAYS PROSECUTOR
In response, the prosecutor Mr Sukumaran reiterated his point that Low was in court because he wilfully disobeyed a police order.
""My learned friend seems to suggest he was picked on in some way. The crux of the offending is he disregarded the law and therefore he is before you,"" he said to the judge.
He added that there are actually no safeguards in terms of the transmission of obscene material from OnlyFans. 
""As the police report showed - a video was found in a 12-year-old's phone. There is always this risk of dissemination, even if it's only open to adults, even if there's verification by age or photo, there's always a risk of dissemination,"" said Mr Sukumaran.
He stressed that probation was for offenders below the age of 21 unless there was a strong propensity for reform, but there was no such evidence of that in this case. As for Low's adjustment disorder, the prosecutor said there is no evidence that it led to his offending.
The defence lawyer had argued that since his charging, Low has become ""reclusive"" and shunned by the public eye, but the prosecutor uploaded two articles showing Low's opening of an ice cream parlour and about a domestic issue.
Low recently married Malaysian influencer Cheryl Chin and announced months later that they were having a baby.
""Those articles show that he is revelling in the public eye, contrary to what he is saying,"" said Mr Sukumaran.
District Judge Brenda Chua noted that Low had planned and taken active steps quickly to regain access to his OnlyFans account, approaching the helpdesk more than once as he was ""determined"" to regain access.
He had access to his account for two weeks until the police discovered it, and his action ""demonstrates a disrespect for police orders and authority"".
She said his repeated behaviour shows a blatant disregard for the law. For the obscene material charge, she noted the number of obscene content involved and similar charges taken into consideration.
The offence of transmitting obscene material electronically carries a jail term of up to three months, a fine or both.
For failing to comply with the order not to access his OnlyFans account, he could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$5,000 or both.

Former managing director of luxury jet firm charged with embezzling more than S$11 million,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-managing-director-luxury-zetta-jet-charged-embezzlement-asia-aviation-3003551,"SINGAPORE: The former managing director of a luxury jet firm was charged in court on Wednesday (Oct 12) with embezzling more than S$11 million.
Cassidy Geoffery Owen, 34, was handed 34 charges including criminal breach of trust by misappropriation, abetting the forgery of invoices and instigating others to falsely record that he had made payments to firms.
According to a police statement, Cassidy was the managing director of aircraft rental and charter company Zetta Jet between 2015 and 2017. He was also a director in aircraft management and consulting company Asia Aviation Company between 2009 and 2017.
He is also accused of using more than S$1.4 million of the embezzled funds for property-related expenditures, and of cheating a company into delivering more than US$400,000 to Asia Aviation on five occasions between 2014 and 2015.
The offences in the charges date back as early as 2014. Cassidy, an Australian, is accused of dishonestly misappropriating US$2.67 million in September 2016 while he was a director of Zetta Jet in Singapore.
His other charge sheets refer to large sums of money, including an accusation of abetting Zetta Jet's finance manager in June 2017 to post a false journal entry of US$1.35 million. The entry stated that Owen had paid that amount to a consulting firm on Zetta Jet's behalf.
He is also accused of using criminal proceeds for his own use, such as in December 2016, when he allegedly used S$1.2 million that was in a shared bank account.
A 46-year-old woman, June Tang Kim Choo, was also charged on Wednesday in relation to the case. She was a director of Zetta Jet between 2015 and 2017 and allegedly failed to use reasonable diligence in her duties by authorising payments of more than S$5 million without checking if they were for the company's purposes.
Cassidy was offered bail of S$300,000 and will return to court next month."
"Cabby, 69, arrested for closing car window on traffic policeman's arm and dragging him along road",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cabby-69-arrested-closing-car-window-traffic-policemans-arm-and-dragging-him-along-road-3003521,"SINGAPORE: Singapore police arrested a 69-year-old taxi driver on Sunday (Oct 9) after he allegedly wound up his car window on a Traffic Police (TP) officer’s arm and drove off, dragging him along the road.
The officer was patrolling around Holland Road on Sunday afternoon when he spotted the taxi driver purportedly using his mobile phone while driving, said the Singapore Police Force in a news release on Wednesday.
He then signalled the driver to stop, but he ignored him and continued driving.
“The TP officer followed him and eventually managed to stop the taxi driver along Farrer Road,” police said. “During the engagement with the 69-year-old driver, the driver was uncooperative and refused to provide his particulars.
“Sensing that the taxi driver might drive off again, the TP officer reached his hand out to turn off the ignition button of the vehicle. However, the driver allegedly wound up his window and drove off before the officer could remove his arm.”
The officer, aged 34, was dragged along the road for ""a few metres"" before the driver stopped and wound down the window, police added.
The driver was subsequently arrested for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharge of duty.
The officer was taken conscious to hospital and received outpatient treatment.
Police investigations are ongoing.
Those convicted of causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharge of duty could be jailed for up to seven years, as well as fined or caned. However, as the taxi driver is above 50 years old, he cannot be caned.
For using a handphone while driving, he could also be fined up to S$1,000, jailed up to six months or both.
The police also reminded motorists to drive safely and abide by traffic rules and regulations.
“The police have zero tolerance towards such brazen acts of violence towards police officers or public servants carrying out their duties,” they said.
“The police will not hesitate to take firm action against those who endanger the safety of our officers or other road users.”"
"Man jailed for pawning fake Rolex Submariner watches for S$18,000 each",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-pawning-fake-rolex-submariner-watches-s18000-each-3003491,"SINGAPORE: A man who pawned counterfeit Rolex watches in a bid to settle his debts was sentenced to 10 months' jail and fined S$3,000 on Wednesday (Oct 10).
Aw Poh Seng, 33, pleaded guilty last month to two counts of cheating and a third unrelated charge of carrying a stun gun at a fitness corner in Yishun. Three other charges were considered in sentencing.
Aw had racked up debts in July 2021 due to loans he took from unlicensed moneylenders and losses incurred from gambling.
After hatching a plan to get money by pledging fake Rolex watches at pawn shops for money, Aw looked for suppliers for watches that bore very close similarities to the real deal.
He found a suitable supplier and bought two counterfeit Rolex watches for S$800 and S$850. On Jul 15, 2021, Aw went to a pawn shop in Marsiling to pledge one of them.
The employee asked for a certificate of authenticity for the Rolex Submariner, but Aw claimed he had lost it. He successfully deceived the employee, who took the watch and gave Aw S$18,000 in return.
Aw also pawned a fake Rolex Deep Sea Dweller watch for S$16,500 at the same shop that day.
As he had received a total of S$34,500 for two counterfeit Rolexes, Aw grew emboldened and decided to cheat the shop again. However, he thought it might look suspicious if he were to take a third watch there, so he got a friend to do it for him.
The friend took another fake Rolex Submariner to the same shop on Jul 16, 2021, where he pledged it for S$18,000.
Aw then used the cash to buy gold. However, the pawn shop caught wind of the scam and a police report was filed days later. Gold items along with S$4,300 in cash were seized from Aw when he was arrested. 
The pawn shop was willing to accept the gold and cash, which was worth about S$31,700 in all, as restitution.
Aw's friend was also nabbed and sentenced in February this year."
19-year-old charged with murdering his father in Yishun,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/19-year-old-teenager-charged-murder-father-yishun-3003321,"SINGAPORE: A 19-year-old teenager was charged in court on Wednesday (Oct 12) with murdering his father two days earlier.
Seah Jie Kai Sylesnar is accused of committing murder by causing the death of Seah Wee Teck Eddie, 47, between the fourth and fifth floor of Block 653, Yishun Avenue 4. The act allegedly occurred at about 7.05pm on Oct 10.
The police said in an earlier statement that they received a call for help at about 7.05pm that day.
They found the victim lying motionless outside a residential unit along Yishun Avenue 4. He was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.
He was arrested at the scene.
The teenager is represented by lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Joyce Khoo from Quahe Woo & Palmer.
The police prosecutor asked for the accused to be remanded for a week with permission to take him out for investigations and to revisit the scene.
When asked if there was a need for a gag order, with reference to his siblings, the prosecutor said he had no instruction on this so far.
Mr Sudheesan made three applications for various types of access to his client - unlimited access, limited access and permission to see the accused person in the presence of an investigation officer to explain his rights to him.
He said he had made these applications multiple times before the same judge, District Judge Terence Tay. He said he wished to speak to his client about his rights under the law as well as possible defences to the murder charge.
Judge Tay said to go into the possible defences to murder was more than the basic procedural rights and asked how the lawyer was going to brief him if he had not taken instructions yet.
The police prosecutor said the case was at the beginning stage and asked the lawyer to speak directly to the investigation officer regarding access, which should occur only after investigations are completed.
Judge Tay ordered Mr Sudheesan to make written submissions and give them to the prosecution by this afternoon. He asked the prosecution to have a deputy public prosecutor present for the case and adjourned the case to Thursday morning for arguments on the defence counsel's access to the teenager.
If found guilty of murder, the teenager could be sentenced to death.

20 to 30 children injured on average every year in Singapore due to falls from high chairs: KKH,"More than a quarter of these injuries over the last five years required hospital admission, says the KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Injuries ranged from head and face lacerations to fractures of the skull and limbs.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/children-baby-high-chairs-fall-injury-safety-regulations-kkh-3001541,"SINGAPORE: About 20 to 30 children were injured every year for the last five years after falling from high chairs, and more than a quarter of these cases required hospital admission, said the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).
Earlier this month, a toddler in Malaysia died after he fell from a high chair while at a restaurant with his parents.
The two-year-old boy was sitting in the high chair when he kicked the table, Malaysian police said. This caused the chair to fall over and he hit his head on the floor. 
KKH, the largest hospital for paediatric healthcare in Singapore, said in response to CNA's queries that it saw 140 cases related to falls from high chairs between 2017 and 2021, with an average of 20 to 30 each year.
About 27 per cent of these required hospital admission. Injuries ranged from fractures of the skull and limbs, lacerations to the head and face, head injuries and bruises to the limbs, said Dr Ronald Tan, a consultant at the hospital's Department of Emergency Medicine.

2-year-old toddler dies after falling from baby chair in Johor Bahru restaurant













In Singapore, suppliers of baby chairs have to ensure their products comply with international safety standards, such as EN 14988, ASTM F404 and ISO 9221. The EN 14988 is a British safety standard, while the ASTM F404 is a US standard and the ISO 9221 an international standard. 
These standards set out the safety requirements for baby high chairs, including stability and weight specifications. 
High chairs that do not comply with these standards are not allowed to be sold in Singapore, said Ms Beatrice Wong, director of the Consumer Product Safety Office, which comes under Enterprise Singapore.
""So far, the CPSO has not received any feedback of unsafe high chairs or reports of injuries resulting from the use of such products in Singapore,"" she said.
However in 2021, it found two models of high chairs being sold in Singapore that did not comply with the ASTM F404 safety standard and issued stop-sale orders to their retailers.
Under Singapore law, any person who fails to comply with the Consumer Product Safety Office's directions to stop the sale of unsafe products faces a fine of up to S$10,000, jail of up to two years, or both. 
One of the two high chairs, the Tatameru, did not have a restraint system and its rearward stability did not meet safety requirements. The Safety 1st Kiwi 3-in-1 Reclinable High Chair, on the other hand, had gaps and leg openings in the crotch restraint that could trap a child or cause a fall. 
The Consumer Product Safety Office said it did not receive reports of injuries caused by either chair, but advised consumers to stop using them immediately.

RETAILERS WEIGH IN
Retailers of children's products told CNA they look out for various features and safety standards when selecting high chairs for sale. 
PramFox, which stocks four different models of high chairs, said it takes into account European safety standards.
Founder Elise Mawson, an engineer by training, said the testing protocol for these safety standards include static load tests, which check how much weight a high chair seat can bear, and stability tests for sliding and tipping, which measures how far a child can lean out before a chair topples. The protocol also checks for mechanical hazards that can cause a child to choke, become trapped or tangled. In addition, tests are run for toxic materials such as lead used in the construction of a high chair. 
""I need to personally really like, trust and recommend the product,"" said Ms Mawson, a mother of three. ""This will encompass the usefulness of the product, construction quality, aesthetic, brand values, safety standards and also the results of independent consumer testing.""
Ms Mawson said parents should also consider the reputation of the seller and the brand.
""Ask which safety standard the product adheres to. Ask what is the maximum weight limit. If they are looking in-person, try to get a feel for the construction quality and material (such as the harness straps) and see if it feels flimsy.
""If you notice (your child is) able to rock the chair ... that's a massive red flag – talk to your retailer about possible solutions.""
She added: ""If you're buying online and reading reviews, try to look for genuinely helpful feedback rather than just the usual 'fast delivery, well packaged and seller gave gift, yet to try'.""
Buyers may also want to check that sellers are available to answer questions on the assembly or usage of the chair, and that the seller is proactive in getting in touch with customers in the event of a product recall.

7-month-old baby dies from suffocation after being trapped between mattress and bed rail: Coroner













Hatchery Cribs director Julius Chen said the retailer heeds the EN 14988 certification for children's high chairs. 
Hatchery Cribs stocks high chairs from German brand Hauck. One safety feature is integrated floor gliders so that if a child pushes away from the table, the high chair moves backwards instead of tilting. 
Mr Daniel Ho, the CEO and founder of Little Baby, said that the shop looks at the manufacturer’s high chair specifications and features such as the safety harness. The store stocks 10 different kinds of high chairs. 
""A baby high chair should be designed in a stable structure with good quality materials, and the design angle of the chair’s legs are very important to prevent from tipping,"" said Mr Ho. 
For example, one of the high chairs it stocks has legs that are angled to the ground, unlike adult chairs. This creates a wider base that is more stable and resistant to tipping. 
Restaurants should consider getting a high chair that can cater to heavier children, said Mr Ho, as they tend to see a variety of children.
""Let's say the restaurant uses (a) high chair which is up to 15kg weight capacity, but the child is heavier than 15kg. Isn't it a risk for the child to sit on the high chair?
""In a public setting, all the kids come in different sizes or weight. Unlike in a home setting, we know our kids' weight and also know how long we want to use the high chair.""





      Safety tips for parents using high chairs 
  

Do not allow your child to stand in the high chair.
Do not leave a young child unsupervised in the high chair.
Do not allow older children to climb or play on the high chair as this may tip it over.
Don't place high chairs near furniture in a way that allows the child to push against them and tip the chair over. 
Check the stability of the high chair by applying some weight on the seat and backrest, or using a push and pull force on each side of the chair.
If the high chair has castors fitted, ensure that at least one pair of castors (either front or back) has brakes to keep the chair stable and in place.
Always use safety straps and adjust them to fit the child snugly. The openings must not be too large such that it is possible for a child to fall through. 
Check that moving parts cannot pinch, crush or trap a child’s finger, toe, limb or head, and that there are no sharp points or edges and small parts present.
If the front torso support or tray is removable, check that it is not easily dislocated by exerting a pull force from each direction of the tray.
For high chairs that are foldable, check that there are latching or locking devices that will prevent the chair from folding during normal use. These devices should not be deactivated easily by a small amount of force.

Conversations about cybersecurity have taken on greater urgency following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: Josephine Teo,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cybersecurity-greater-urgency-russia-invasion-ukraine-josephine-teo-3002386,"SINGAPORE: Conversations about cybersecurity have taken on a greater sense of urgency following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Oct 11).
Speaking to reporters at a virtual media doorstop, she highlighted how Ukraine’s efforts to build cyber resilience over the years helped it to maintain contact with citizens and continue providing some services, despite being under seige.
Reiterating her message from last year’s summit, she stressed the need to shift cybersecurity posture from emphasising preventative measures to an “assume breach” mindset. 
“We should practice zero trust in how we defend our systems and also, in some sense, assume that we have already been breached. This is significant as a paradigm because it changes the way we think about our priorities and our posture,” she said.
“It means that from just doing threat hunting, penetration testing, (or) trying to build up the defences, we would also have equal focus on recovery - in the event that we identify a breach - and also make the effort to build resilience in our cybersecurity systems,” she added.
Mrs Teo was wrapping up a week-long working visit to the UK and Estonia, where she met government officials and industry leaders as well as participated in the Tallinn Digital Summit in Estonia.
During a panel discussion at the summit on Tuesday, Mrs Teo said the cyber landscape has seen intensifying international cooperation. However, more needs to be done in terms of capacity building and exchange of information.
She also stressed the importance of strengthening rules-based international order in cyberspace.
REGULATING CYBERSPACE
Turning to Singapore, Mrs Teo highlighted recent efforts to further regulate cyberspace. This includes updating the Personal Data Protection Act in 2020 as well as tabling a new Bill last week that will make social media platforms liable if they fail to protect users from harmful online content.
With the digital domain evolving so quickly, she said regulations must be properly scoped in order to be effective.
“If you want to cover everything at one go, it is not impossible, but it simply makes even debating a Bill very challenging, because there are just too many dimensions,” she said.
“Each one of us is trying to find our way forward. With digital regulations, there's really no play book ... it’s not like building codes or fire safety codes.”
Parliament will debate the Bill at its second reading, which is slated for next month."
Rumours about large increase in severe COVID-19 cases and deaths due to XBB strain 'not true': MOH,"The Ministry of Health said that it is initiating Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act action against such rumours.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-xbb-strain-whatsapp-rumours-severe-cases-deaths-not-true-pofma-moh-3002421,"SINGAPORE: Rumours that Singapore is seeing a significant increase in severe COVID-19 cases and deaths due to the XBB strain are untrue, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Oct 11).
""There have been rumours circulating via WhatsApp that Singapore is having a rapid and large increase in cases with severe illness and deaths due to the circulating XBB strain,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""This is not true. We are initiating POFMA action against such falsehoods,"" it added, referring to the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.
While there is an increase in local cases driven by XBB, including the post-weekend spike this Tuesday, MOH said the number of severe cases has remained relatively low. 
""This is very likely due to the resilience built up through vaccination and previous waves of infection. We are monitoring the trajectory closely,"" the ministry added.
""More importantly, there is also no evidence of XBB causing more severe illness. So far, the large majority of patients continue to report mild symptoms such as sore throat or slight fever, especially if they have been vaccinated.""
The XBB strain is an Omicron subvariant that has also been detected in countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Denmark, India, Japan and the United States since August.

Patients who walk into emergency departments with non-emergency conditions, including children, will be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment in order to prioritise resources for patients who need the medical care, MOH added.
Singapore reported 11,732 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. This is the first time the daily caseload has exceeded 10,000 in more than two months.














Earlier on Tuesday, MOH said that it will bring forward the administration of the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine to Oct 14, three days ahead of schedule. 
The early roll-out was made possible by the ministry's operations teams completing preparations ahead of the deadline.
In addition, there are ""benefits to administering early as infections are rising due to the XBB Omicron subvariant"", said MOH.
""The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine, with the same dosage for boosting,"" added MOH.
""Instead of targeting only the original COVID-19 virus, the updated version also targets the Omicron variant. It therefore will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants. It is proven to be safe and effective.""
Speaking to reporters at the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre in Commonwealth on Tuesday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung acknowledged that COVID-19 cases in Singapore had been rising and added that MOH is watching the XBB strain ""very closely"".
""XBB is demonstrating characteristics that it is dominating over all other subvariants. It has been detected in many parts of the world but in Singapore is rising very fast – within three weeks from nothing, it is now over half of all the daily cases,"" he said.
""But so far, what is good is that there's no evidence that it leads to more severe outcomes.""
In a breakdown of local COVID-19 cases by strain posted on MOH's website on Monday, the ministry said that about 55 per cent of infections stemmed from the XBB strain, which is also known as BA.2.10.
This was an increase from 22 per cent in the preceding week, MOH said.
BA.5 was responsible for about 21 per cent of cases, while BA.2.75 was responsible for 24 per cent. Both are also Omicron subvariants.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/case-alerts-consumers-phishing-emails-impersonating-officers-requesting-personal-bank-details-mail-server-hacked-3002156,"SINGAPORE: The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) on Tuesday (Oct 11) alerted consumers to phishing emails from ""fictitious sender names"" impersonating its officers after the mail server managed by its service provider was hacked.
The phishing emails, sent from two mailboxes - online-submission@ case.org.sg and mediator1@ case.org.sg - requested for consumers who had submitted complaints via CASE’s website to perform payment transactions to receive monetary compensation.
While these emails were sent from email addresses that CASE may have used to communicate with consumers, the latest notifications they receive did not originate from CASE, it said.
In these emails, consumers were asked to participate in the live chat, and approach bank partners to perform payment transactions relating to their complaints to receive monetary compensation.
""CASE will not direct consumers through email or live chat to visit another website to key in their bank details,"" it said.
CASE said it started receiving reports of the phishing emails on Oct 8, and as of Tuesday, 2pm, 5,095 phishing emails were sent.

CASE said that upon confirmation that the mail server managed by its service provider was hacked, it worked with its IT vendors to suspend the affected mailboxes and reconfigure the email accounts to stop more phishing emails from being sent.
""Our IT vendors have also conducted a thorough check and confirm that our databases and website remain secure,"" CASE said.
It added that investigations revealed that the unauthorised access was limited to consumers’ email addresses and all other personal information remains secure.
CASE advised consumers who received the email notifications not to click on the links and disclose personal and bank details.
Consumers who received these email notifications and consumers who performed the payment transactions should lodge a report with the police and the anti-scam hotline as soon as possible, it added.
CASE said that it has taken immediate action was taken ""to establish the scope of the incident and its impact"", adding that it is carrying out further investigations to ""determine the root cause of this incident"".
""We have reported the incident to the police and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and are rendering our fullest cooperation to resolve this incident.

HDB to pilot 'beamless' flat designs in new Tengah BTO project,"The Garden Waterfront I & II @ Tengah will be launched in November 2022 and built using new innovations and technologies.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tengah-hdb-bto-beamless-flat-innovations-3001261,"SINGAPORE: An upcoming Build-to-Order (BTO) project in Tengah town will feature ""beamless"" flats providing more headroom and flexibility to configure layouts, as part of an initiative by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to pilot the latest construction technologies.
Under HDB's Construction Transformation Project, Garden Waterfront I and II @ Tengah - which will be launched in the November 2022 sales exercise - will adopt a slew of innovations in its design, fabrication and construction of about 2,000 units. 
HDB will partner construction firm Obayashi Singapore and other local consultancy partners to trial the technologies, which aim to improve productivity and eventually reduce the waiting time for new flats.
Speaking at the annual HDB awards ceremony on Tuesday (Oct 11), Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said: ""This project will seek to integrate the very latest construction processes and technologies across HDB's development value chain to boost construction productivity.""
The ceremony, held at the Resorts World Convention Centre, will see Mr Lee present awards to HDB building contractors and architectural consultants for their contributions. 
""It will also seek to break new ground with the use of sustainable construction methods. We hope that through this collaboration, our local partners will learn from one another and our international counterparts, as we continue to build capability,"" added Mr Lee. 
Mr Lee noted that the drive for construction productivity was not new to HDB.
""In fact, HDB is an early adopter of prefab technology. It first used precast components in construction in the 1980s. But we must keep striving to improve and the COVID pandemic has accelerated these efforts,"" he said. 
Construction activities have returned close to pre-pandemic levels, added Mr Lee. 
HDB said it attained a site productivity improvement rate of 26.2 per cent last year, and has set a 40 per cent target by 2030. 
For BTO flats built under the Construction Transformation Project alone, the HDB is targeting a 25 per cent improvement in productivity, compared to other projects.
HDB's chief executive officer Tan Meng Dui said that with the initiative, the agency hopes to ""raise the bar further and find novel ways to construct quality homes with less manpower, faster and safer"".

NEW TECHNOLOGIES
The beamless flat design to be trialed in Tengah will be made possible through a hybrid precast system involving both 2D and 3D precast components.
This is a more efficient alternative to the full 3D prefabricated, prefinished volumetric construction components used in many HDB projects. 
Units built with the flat plate system will have no ceiling beams and hence have ""consistently higher"" headroom compared to typical BTO projects, said HDB.
This also gives homeowners more flexibility to configure their layouts as they wish without having to take into account ceiling beams, HDB added.

Under its Construction Transformation Project, HDB will also seek to improve the design process by modelling flats virtually instead of physically. 
Previously, life-size timber mock-ups of kitchens and toilets had to be assembled, taking up time and resources.
With virtual technology, HDB said it can now build a digital twin of a residential unit with details such as the position of pipes, sanitary fixtures, power points, switches and furniture.

HDB said it was already piloting 3D concrete printing for furniture and landscape features in some projects in Tengah and Bidadari.
Under the Construction Transformation Project, it will go ""one step further"" and use special fibreglass reinforced concrete material, HDB said. 
This potentially uses less material than the conventional 3D printing method, and allows for studies on larger and more complex structures to be made without the need for intricate moulds.
HDB will also test innovations from construction firm Obayashi, including the use of artificial intelligence to optimise hoisting of precast components in tower crane operations.
Light detection and ranging technology will also be used to avoid collisions.
In the construction of multi-storey carparks, crawler cranes - largely manually operated at present - will be guided by technology onto optimum paths for lifting elements.
Instead of having workers manually guide components into place, HDB will also use the SkyJuster device to orientate and lower precast elements, reducing the manpower required.

HDB said it will also adopt digital technologies such as a cloud-based common data environment to integrate work processes and help with managing and planning logistics. 
For instance, precast components will be tracked using radio frequency identification or Bluetooth tags from the time they are fabricated to when they are delivered and assembled. 
Key takeaways from the Construction Transformation Project's application in Tengah will be studied for future implementation in other housing areas, said HDB."
"Chye sim, mint, basil: Singapore vegetable farm wants more consumers for its greens","Singapore imports more than 90 per cent of its food source, and it is critical for the country to find ways to ensure the resilience of its food supplies, says Sustainability and Environment Minister Grace Fu.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/urban-farming-vegetables-comcrop-sustainability-food-security-3001741,"SINGAPORE: Hidden among the concrete facades of factories in the Woodlands East Industrial Estate is a lush, tranquil rooftop space flourishing with homegrown chye sim, mint and basil.  
The rooftop farm is owned by ComCrop, one of Singapore’s pioneer companies in urban farming, and it is on track to ramp up its production tenfold.  
This follows a grant from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), as part of efforts to meet the country's food security goals.  
ComCrop has made strides in increasing its yield with the use of technology, moving steadily towards its target to produce more than 20 tonnes of greens in a month, compared to the same amount in a year with their previous set-up. 
















The firm's hydroponic greenhouse uses water-based mineral nutrient solutions to grow vegetables in natural sunlight, with an automated farming system and a mobile gulley system to maximise the use of space, increase productivity, and reduce manpower.  
The farm also uses remote monitoring to manage the growth of its plants and lighting technology to conduct daylight extension, ensuring a consistent daily harvest.  
“The weather station monitors the weather every day, and it determines if we need to extend the daylight – and (if we do), the lights will be turned on automatically to compensate so we get consistent growth on a daily basis,” said Mr Peter Barber, co-owner and chief executive officer of ComCrop.  
He was speaking at the opening of the farm’s new facility on Sunday (Oct 9). 
The farm currently produces enough to send a daily haul of fresh vegetables to supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice and online grocer RedMart.      
LOCALS KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOME-GROWN PRODUCE  
Despite the availability of local crops and their competitive prices, Mr Barber said that sales have been slow.  
People do not know about the existence of urban farming and its benefits, said Mr Barber.  
“A lot of people didn't believe that this could be done, to be able to grow vegetables in an urban environment and to grow them on a rooftop,” Mr Barber told CNA.
“That was already a big challenge, but we've worked out how to do that and we've got a really strong robust system now.”  
The next challenge is to get people to buy local produce, he said, “not just because it's grown here, but also because it's healthier”.  
“In our case, it's grown without pesticides, so it's definitely much healthier than what you're getting from some of the international supply,” he added.

Singapore prefers farming 'resource-efficient' food items over poultry due to constraints: Grace Fu













Singapore imports more than 90 per cent of its food source, and it is critical for the country to proactively find ways to ensure the resilience of its food supplies, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a speech at the launch of the facility.  
While the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be over, geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events caused by climate change can continue to cause disruptions in global food production and supply, Ms Fu said.  
“It is with this purpose in mind that we put forward our ‘30 by 30’ goal. This will provide us with a significant buffer against food supply disruptions. The ‘30 by 30’ goal is an ambitious one, especially since we're striving to achieve it through highly productive, climate-resilient, and resource-efficient means,” she said.  
BUYING LOCAL PRODUCE    
ComCrop is the first of seven recipients to utilise SFA’s ""30 by 30"" grant to expand, automate and employ technology to boost yields and efficiency at its hybrid greenhouse facility in Woodlands.
The “30 by 30” initiative aims to build up Singapore’s capability to meet 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs with food produced locally by 2030.  
Apart from being prepared for supply disruptions from international food sources, close proximity from farm to table means local produce is fresher and more environmentally sustainable, said Ms Fu, calling for consumers to support local products.  
“It is fresh, it incurs less transportation and therefore less miles on the road,” she said.
“Higher local demand for homegrown produce will keep our farms commercially viable and spur our farmers to become more productive. Your support of local produce will go a long way in strengthening Singapore's food security.”  
Local greens are marked by bright one- and two-star signs on their packaging, with one star representing produce as homegrown, and two stars providing additional quality assurance that the farmers' management practices have been audited and certified to produce food in an environmentally friendly and socially responsible manner.  
Mr Barber echoed Ms Fu’s call to buy Singapore-grown food. Consumers’ support is vital in ensuring the advancement of local farms, he said.  
“Basically our food security in the future is determined by our purchasing decisions in the supermarket,” he added. “So if we keep buying local, that means farms like us can invest more, we can grow more, and then you'll have more variety.”"
"Singapore eateries try new recipes, switch to local produce amid supply disruptions","As rising costs and shortages continue to hit fruit and vegetable suppliers, eateries have been forced to change their menus.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/restaurants-adjust-menu-amid-rising-costs-3001481,"SINGAPORE: More restaurants in Singapore are shaking up their menus, from trying new recipes to switching to locally grown produce, as rising costs and shortages continue to affect their supplies. 
Some fruit and vegetable distributors have experienced a 30 per cent drop in supplies from exporters. Prices for these items have also tripled. 
Mr Desmond Lim, marketing manager at Lim Thiam Chwee Food Supplier, pointed to how some countries have yet to fully open up since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 
""They are still having a lot of intermittent lockdowns, workers not going to work or not being able to work, and entire companies being temporarily suspended,” he added. “So that has resulted in a lot of shortage of manpower in the exporting countries.""
Such supply chain disruptions will not go away anytime soon, said Mr Lim. 
“All we can do is to embrace what it is, work with what we have and adapt accordingly.”
CHANGING MENUS
One particular item that has been in shortage is chilli padi.
Mr Lim’s firm has only been able to get half of its usual supply of chilli padi - and at triple the cost. 
Thailand, where it mainly gets its chilli padi from, is grappling with a labour crunch and rising prices of fertiliser, said Mr Lim, adding that he foresees these problems continuing till the end of the year. 
Some players in the restaurant scene have had no choice but to absorb the resulting higher costs or to make changes to their menus.
Hug Cafe, a Thai eatery in Alexandra Road, has had to rethink its menu, after reducing its order of papayas by 20 per cent to keep overheads down.
Mr Brendon Lim, a chef at the cafe, said its Thai supplier makes limited trips to Singapore. 
“So, we can only order this much per week because if we order too much, the vegetables will turn bad or the papayas will ripen because we do use raw papayas for papaya salad,” he added. 
If an ingredient is unavailable, the cafe will adjust its menu, said its chef Mr Lim. 
“We brainstorm from time to time. Of course, these challenges cannot be avoided. So, we would want to have different alternatives to every dish we make.”

Singapore must do more to diversify food sources as supply disruptions will continue: PM Lee













SOURCING LOCALLY
Another restaurant, Cinder Steakhouse at Seletar Aerospace Park, is facing similar issues. 
For some weeks now, they have only been able to get half their orders of tomatoes and herbs.
Sometimes, they do not get their supplies.
But the steakhouse’s chef de cuisine, Mr Steven Teo, remains unfazed. 
His team works with the items that are available: For example, if they run out of asparagus for a dish or if the quality is bad, the restaurant will replace the vegetable with something else such as broccolini, said Mr Teo.
Mexican restaurant Super Loco has resorted to sourcing for ingredients from vegetable farmers locally, instead of tweaking its menus or swapping out ingredients.
Super Loco Group executive chef Randy Torres said: ""We have tried to put more emphasis on using menu items that have locally sourced products.”
The restaurant is also finding ways to work with local growers to ensure that its fruit and vegetable supply remains secure."
"Leadership changes announced at SPH Media Group; new editors for Straits Times, Business Times",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sph-media-group-straits-times-leadership-changes-warren-fernandez-3001791,"SINGAPORE: SPH Media Group announced several changes to leadership positions in its newsrooms on Tuesday (Oct 11), with new editors set to take the helm at its newspapers The Straits Times (ST) and The Business Times (BT).
The editor-in-chief of SPH Media's English/Malay/Tamil Media group (EMTM) and editor of ST Warren Fernandez will leave the company to pursue other professional opportunities, ST reported SPH Media as saying.
He will be replaced in his EMTM role by Mr Wong Wei Kong, the current editor of BT.
The EMTM group includes ST, BT, Berita Harian and Tamil Murasu.
Mr Fernandez's role as editor of ST, meanwhile, will be taken on by Mr Jaime Ho, the former chief editor of CNA Digital.
Mr Wong's position at BT will be taken over by the newspaper's current executive editor Chen Huifen.
All three appointments will take effect on Oct 26, reported ST.
""It has been my honour to serve as the editor-in-chief of ST and its sister titles which so many Singaporeans rely on for credible news and views,"" ST reported Mr Fernandez as saying.
""My colleagues and I have strived to transform our newsrooms to become multimedia news operations to meet audiences' changing needs. This remains a work in progress, and the challenge now passes to my colleagues to take this further forward. I will be cheering them on as they do.""
A Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) scholar, Mr Fernandez first joined ST in 1990, becoming news editor, foreign editor and deputy editor during his first stint at the paper.
He left in 2008 to take on a management role at Royal Dutch Shell before returning as the paper's editor in 2012. He became EMTM group editor-in-chief in 2016.
Mr Khaw Boon Wan, the chairman of SPH Media's holding company SPH Media Trust, thanked Mr Fernandez for his work with ST.
""I would like to thank Warren for his extraordinary dedication to ST in the past decade,"" ST reported him as saying.
""Warren has successfully paved the way for ST's continued growth, both as a news product on multiple platforms and an established brand. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.""
Mr Wong, who has been the editor of BT since 2016, reflected on the importance of the group he will now oversee.
""In an increasingly polarised world, the four newsrooms in EMTM – ST, BT, and the vernaculars, Berita Harian and Tamil Murasu – must strive to be the credible voices that Singaporeans trust,"" the ST reported him as saying.
""I look forward to working with my newsroom colleagues to enable and support them to achieve this.""
Mr Ho said that it was an honour to be joining ST at this stage of its evolution.
""I am honoured to have the opportunity to play a role in the next phase of ST's transformation, especially as it pushes its digital growth, and takes on the challenges of disruption in the news and media industry in Singapore and around the world,"" ST reported him as saying.
A former civil servant who spent more than 15 years with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Ho joined Mediacorp in 2013, becoming chief editor of CNA Digital in 2016. He held this role until April 2022.
Ms Chen, who will become the BT's second-ever female editor, has been with SPH for more than 20 years."
FPDA militaries to train against supply chain disruptions amid 'uncertain' geopolitical environment,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fpda-ukraine-war-supply-chain-disruption-3001566,"SINGAPORE: Member states of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) said on Tuesday (Oct 11) they will include supply chain disruptions in future military exercises, as defence chiefs vowed to continue training realistically to ensure the 51-year-old pact remains relevant.
The FPDA - formed in 1971 against the backdrop of armed conflict across Southeast Asia - comprises Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. Under the pact, member states must consult each other in case of an armed attack on Malaysia or Singapore.
Defence chiefs of the member states are in Singapore from Monday to Wednesday to attend a conference, where they acknowledged that the recovering global health situation has allowed them to gradually resume the regular tempo of exercises and activities.
FPDA countries participate in annual military exercises, including the flagship Exercise Bersama Gold and Bersama Shield, to strengthen cooperation and build professional relationships.

Singapore's Chief of Defence Force Lieutenant-General (LG) Melvyn Ong, who chaired the conference, said the defence chiefs discussed counterterrorism, sea piracy, new threats and how Russia's war in Ukraine contributed to supply chain disruptions.
""What all this just speaks to is the fact that the security environment that we face today is a lot more uncertain than before,"" he said.
LG Ong said this means it is important to update the relevance of FPDA's joint exercises even as conventional warfighting - including interoperability and proficiency of air, maritime and land forces - remains at the group's core.
""In Exercise Suman Protector later on this year, we will include things like humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. We will also include supply chain disruptions. We will include non-combatant evacuation operations as part of the FPDA exercise serials,"" he said.
The opening ceremony for Exercise Suman Protector, another FDPA exercise, will be held at Changi Naval Base on Wednesday. It will involve 261 personnel from the five countries and the FPDA's Headquarters Integrated Area Defence System, which is based in Malaysia and protects the skies of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.
""The FPDA exercises will continue to be relevant and will continue to be updated according to the threats and the challenges that we face. And the chiefs affirmed the importance of the remit and the relevance of this arrangement,"" LG Ong added.
The war in Ukraine has disrupted the export of millions of tonnes of grain, causing a shortage in feedstock and an increase in poultry prices, while the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced manpower, delayed ships and caused bottlenecks at major ports worldwide.
It is unclear how the FPDA militaries will simulate supply chain disruptions, but LG Ong said the group has updated the nature of its exercises over the years, including training and sharing information on unmanned aerial systems.
UK's Vice Chief of the Defence Staff General Gwyn Jenkins said a ""key part"" of discussions at the conference was FPDA's relevance in the modern era.
The group had said on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in June that it was committed to ensuring the defence pact had ""modern relevance"" in the face of complex security challenges.
""It's the significance of us conducting realistic exercises in order to ensure that we may remain relevant in this 51 years of a defensive pact, in an uncertain time in a region with its own tensions,"" General Jenkins said.
When asked about the FPDA's role in maintaining regional stability amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, LG Ong said the FPDA - as a security arrangement - has helped member states understand each other and work together better.
""I think for all the tensions that we face, the ability to have dialogue, the ability to converse, the ability to see and the ability to operate with one another is invaluable,"" he said.
""I think the FPDA will continue to provide that platform for us to work together and to be that ballast against the threats that we see in this region. And certainly it will be a part of the regional security architecture for this region.""
In a joint statement on Tuesday, the defence chiefs said the FPDA is a ""constructive, transparent and peaceful arrangement"" that has been an integral part of the regional security architecture for more than 50 years.
""As the FPDA continues to enhance the professional value of conventional exercises, it will also build capacity in other areas including counterterrorism, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and cyber and information to keep pace with the evolving security challenges,"" they said."

""Through our regulatory testing, SFA has identified the chilli powder to be contaminated with ethylene oxide,"" it said in an updated media release.
SFA has directed Indostop Singapore to recall Mie Sedaap Kari Spesial instant cup noodles and Korean Spicy Chicken instant cup noodles, said SFA, adding that the recall is ongoing.
The latest recall affects the Mie Sedaap Kari Spesial instant cup noodles with an expiry date of Mar 27, 2023, and the Mie Sedaap Korean Spicy Chicken instant cup noodles with an expiry date of Apr 24, 2023.
A total of six products under the Mie Sedaap instant noodle brand have been recalled, after four other products were recalled earlier on Oct 6 and Oct 8.
The manufacturer, PT Wings Surya, is working with importers to withdraw Mie Sedaap instant noodle products with chilli powder from the retail market, and will also reformulate their product to rectify the cause of ethylene oxide contamination, said SFA.

"Bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine available in Singapore Oct 14, three days ahead of schedule",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-booster-moderna-3001451,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) will bring forward the administration of the Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine to Oct 14, three days ahead of the previously announced date, the ministry said on Tuesday (Oct 11).
The early rollout was made possible by the ministry's operations teams completing preparations ahead of the deadline.
In addition, there are ""benefits to administering early as infections are rising due to the XBB Omicron subvariant"", said MOH. 
The XBB strain, also known as BA.2.10, has been detected in several countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Denmark, India, Japan and the USA since August. Based on preliminary local data, MOH said, XBB cases are not more serious than other Omicron subvariants.
“The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine, with the same dosage for boosting,” added MOH.
“Instead of targeting only the original COVID-19 virus, the updated version also targets the Omicron variant. It therefore will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants. It is proven to be safe and effective.”
The ministry added that the approach and process of updating a vaccine with new strains of a disease is an “established practice”. It added that based on post market surveillance, to date more than 11 million updated bivalent mRNA vaccine doses have been administered in the US without any safety concerns reported.
Speaking to reporters at the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre at Commonwealth on Tuesday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung acknowledged that COVID-19 cases in Singapore have been rising, but said that was not the main factor in the decision to bring forward administration of the bivalent vaccine.
Mr Ong and Minister for Trade Gan Kim Yong - co-chairs of the Government's multi-ministry task force on COVID-19 -  received a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine at the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre.
“Most important is that operationally we are ready,"" Mr Ong said. ""Yesterday's report was almost 5,000 cases and usually Tuesday is double that of Monday’s cases, so today I think we should expect 10,000 cases or more. So cases are rising … If we are operationally ready and we can do it earlier, I would say why not?”
Mr Ong also spoke about the XBB strain, adding that MOH is watching it ""very closely"".
""XBB is demonstrating characteristics that it is dominating over all other sub-variants. It has been detected in many parts of the world but in Singapore is rising very fast - within three weeks from nothing, it is now over half of all the daily cases,"" he added.
""But so far, what is good is that there's no evidence that it leads to more severe outcomes.""

MOH  announced last week that the current mRNA vaccines will be replaced by bivalent vaccines, as recommended by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination. 
The Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron COVID-19 vaccine is the first bivalent vaccine against the coronavirus to be authorised as a booster here.
HSA said it consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts in making the regulatory decision.
The COVID-19 vaccines used in Singapore until now have been monovalent, which means they only contain or encode the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In comparison, Moderna’s bivalent vaccine has been updated to protect against the Omicron BA.1 variant in addition to the original strain. It contains 25 micrograms each of the components targeting the two viruses.

15 out of 100 people with COVID-19 in Singapore are infected before: Ong Ye Kung,"If reinfection rate hits 50 per cent, Singapore will be in for another COVID-19 wave, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-covid-19-reinfection-15-out-100-ong-ye-kung-3001316,"SINGAPORE: Fifteen out of 100 people who caught COVID-19 have been reinfected, and another wave could be around the corner if this number climbs.
Giving the figures on Monday (Oct 10) night, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said the likelihood of a big wave depends on the reinfection rate. 
""As of now, reinfection rate is about 15 per cent, meaning out of 100 people who are infected, 15 are getting it for the second time. If you start to see 50 per cent getting it a second time, you're going to have a wave,"" he said during the Yale-NUS College President's Speaker Series of public lectures. 
More than 4,000 cases were reported on Sunday and Monday. And with Tuesday being the most dreaded day of the week, cases could double today, noted Mr Ong. 
""You may have 9,000, 10,000 cases, usually it's double that of the day before. So hospitals will get busier, healthcare workers will come under strain and we will have to support them as much as we can. But we'll have to try our best with the current rules (to) ride through this,"" he said.  
Case numbers usually spike on Tuesday due to people socialising over the weekend. 
Mr Ong pointed out that Singapore was able to ride through each wave of infection and yet continue plans to open up the country. The current case numbers are due to Singapore being ""in the middle"" of this phase of reopening. 
""Because each time we open up and we ride through a wave, whoever falls sick do appear at the hospital. We are in the middle of that,"" he said.

GETTING RID OF RULES A ""TURNING POINT""
Recounting his experience of handling the COVID-19 pandemic as the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force, Mr Ong recalled one of the ""few big moves"" that the task force made was the decision to live with the virus. 
""Delta wave was raging ... Then we did something, which when I look back, was a bit decisive. ... We decided let's press the reset button. Get rid of all (the rules) overnight and just have three rules, and that's the Protocol 1-2-3. ... Which means we did away with quarantine overnight. 40,000 people in quarantine were released from their home,"" he said.
""Did we know that what we did was absolutely right and will the release of people in quarantine lead to an even bigger wave? Did we know that at that point in time? Not totally. But looking at the data, it was a risk that I think was worth taking."" 
Mr Ong said that with the simplified rules, individuals knew how to play their part, whereas with confusing rules, people were ""just afraid"". 
That decision was ""a big turning point"", as vaccination rates went up and people knew how to take responsibility for themselves, he added.
""(By) the time (our vaccination rate) reached 80, 90 per cent, Delta wave was over. We started to open after that. Rest is history.""

"Death of technician crushed by bus he was repairing was avoidable, says coroner",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/death-technician-crushed-bus-he-was-repairing-was-avoidable-says-coroner-smrt-thin-soon-fatt-3001326,"SINGAPORE: The death of a technician who was crushed by a bus he was repairing could have been avoided if the correct equipment had been used, a coroner said in findings made available this week.
Malaysian Thin Soon Fatt, 43, died in hospital on Jun 6 last year of head injuries after the bus he was repairing dropped and hit his head, causing skull fractures.
State Coroner Adam Nakhoda found Mr Thin's death a work-related misadventure.
Mr Thin had been employed as a technician by Strides Automotive Services, earlier named SMRT Automotive Services, since March 2014.
He was the team leader involved in the maintenance of 26 buses and other electric buggies used by SMRT.
On Jun 6, 2021, Mr Thin and two other technicians were at Ang Mo Kio bus depot carrying out corrective maintenance on a bus that had a loose steering wheel.
One of the technicians, Mr Tan Kaek Seng, went under the bus to check on the steering knuckle arm while Mr Thin manipulated the steering wheel. They confirmed there was an issue with the steering knuckle and that corrective maintenance had to be performed.
Mr Tan wanted to retrieve some air-jacks and axle stands to lift and prop up the bus, but Mr Thin told him there was no need to use the air-jacks and axle stands. He suggested using two other portable scissor jacks - a Kawasaki jack and a Nissan jack - instead.
Mr Thin then went under the bus and positioned the scissor jacks in place. Mr Tan retrieved some tools needed for the maintenance and asked Mr Thin if he should get the axle stands to support the bus, but Mr Thin said it was not necessary.
Mr Tan went under the bus and completed the repairs by installing a new part. He greased the part and told the rest of the team that he was done.
Mr Thin began lowering the scissor jacks. Suddenly, the 7.5-ton bus dropped onto Mr Tan and Mr Thin, who were under the bus.
Mr Thin was struck on the head by the chassis of the bus, while Mr Tan was pinned down by a protruding part of the undercarriage. Mr Tan managed to extricate himself from the undercarriage with some help, while others pulled Mr Thin out from the bus and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him.
Both men were taken to hospital but Mr Thin could not be revived.
Investigations showed that the scissor jacks had stickers on them with symbols indicating that people were not allowed to work under the vehicle when the vehicle was lifted by the jack. The Kawasaki jack and Nissan Jack had safe working load limits of 1.1 tons and 0.95 tons respectively.
The scissor jacks were not included in the approved list of tools by Strides and were overloaded when the front portion of the bus was lifted on them.
The coroner said that if the air-jack and axle stands had been used, the incident would have been avoided as the axle stands would have been able to support the weight of the bus without failing.
""This was an avoidable accident. Had the correct equipment, that is, the air-jack and axle stands been used, the accident would have been prevented,"" said the coroner.
""As such, I would recommend that companies and businesses involved in the repair of heavy vehicles, ensure that technicians and workers use the correct equipment when carrying out repairs.""

Man jailed for molesting stranger after following her to her doorstep,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-eight-weeks-jail-molest-stranger-follow-home-3001301,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to eight weeks' jail on Tuesday (Oct 11) for molesting a stranger after following her home.
Baxter Fan Li Hang, 24, pleaded guilty to one count of outraging the 25-year-old victim's modesty.
The court heard that Fan, a Malaysian chef, ended his work shift at about 10pm on Aug 29 this year. He took the train from Potong Pasir to Kovan and was walking along Upper Serangoon Road when he saw the victim.
The Malaysian woman was wearing a white skirt and walking on the opposite side of the road, the prosecutor said.
Fan did not know the woman, but decided to follow her as he thought she looked sexy in her skirt, court documents stated.
He crossed the road and followed the victim for 10 to 15 minutes. The woman did not notice him following her as she was listening to music on her earbuds, said the prosecutor.
She reached her home and was opening the gate to her unit when Fan approached her from behind and used both hands to touch her buttocks.
The victim turned around in shock, and Fan hurriedly mumbled ""sorry"" before walking away.
The victim was frightened and went into her unit instead of pursuing Fan, but as she was talking to her flatmate, she realised there were police cameras outside her unit.
She made a police report. Fan's actions were captured on police cameras and the footage was played in court. He was identified and arrested two days later.
The prosecutor asked for eight weeks' jail, saying that Fan following the victim for a significant length of time was aggravating as it shows some premeditation.
""The accused thereafter brazenly outraged the victim's modesty by touching her buttocks right at her doorstep when she was not fully aware of her surroundings,"" said the prosecutor.
She added that Fan showed ""no regard for the victim's personal autonomy"" and effectively treated her simply as an object for his sexual gratification because he found her sexy in her skirt.
However, she noted that Fan had no previous convictions and pleaded guilty at the first instance.
For molestation, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given a combination of these punishments."
Doctor charged in case of woman who died after aesthetic treatment in 2019,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-chan-bingyi-revival-clinic-lau-li-ting-died-treatment-3001201,"SINGAPORE: A doctor was charged on Tuesday (Oct 11) in relation to a case in 2019 where a woman died after receiving an aesthetic treatment at a clinic.
Dr Chan Bingyi, a 34-year-old Singaporean, was given one charge of causing the death of Ms Lau Li Ting by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide.
A check of the Ministry of Health's database shows he is still registered as a medical practitioner.
He is accused of administering ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA, to Ms Lau intravenously on Mar 8, 2019 at Revival Medical & Aesthetics Centre in 90 Bras Basah Road.
EDTA is a common ingredient in skincare and cosmetic products. It acts as a chelator or binding agent that suppresses chemical activity.
Dr Chan allegedly administered the acid at too high a concentration and too quickly, when there were no indications for using it on Ms Lau.
According to the charge sheet, Dr Chan's negligent act caused Ms Lau, who was 31 at the time, to develop EDTA toxicity. This in turn led to her cardiac arrest and eventual death.
Reports at the time said that Ms Lau was taken to the hospital after her treatment and was on life support for several days before dying on Mar 13.
If convicted of causing the death of Ms Lau by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, Dr Chan can be jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.
He was offered bail of S$5,000 and will return to court next month. Additional charges are expected.Editor's note: This article has been corrected to remove the reference to Botox in the headline and opening paragraph."
Rising temperatures could increase risk of new infectious diseases in Singapore: Experts,"A study published in August found that climate change has exacerbated more than 200 infectious diseases and dozens of non-transmissible conditions.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/climate-change-infectious-diseases-zika-monkeypox-dengue-singapore-2973651,"SINGAPORE: A global travel hub, Singapore sees thousands of visitors arriving on its shores each year.
But rising temperatures could also bring in a different type of visitor into the country: Infectious diseases.
A recent study published in scientific journal Nature Climate Change in August found that climate change has exacerbated more than 200 infectious diseases and dozens of non-transmissible conditions, such as poisonous snake bites.
Poring through the medical literature of established cases of illnesses, researchers found that 218 out of the known 375 human infectious diseases - or 58 per cent - seemed to be made worse by one of 10 types of extreme weather connected to climate change.
This includes malaria, monkeypox and Zika.
In recent years, Singapore has also seen record-breaking numbers of dengue cases, as temperatures continue to rise.
As of Monday (Oct 10), the country has already exceeded 28,000 cases – more than five times the total cases reported for the whole of 2021, which was 5,258.
“As climate changes, the overall geographical range of mosquito species also changes and that's why we've seen the expansion of dengue further away from the equator than historically we have,” said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice dean of research at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
To fight dengue, the country has employed a variety of mosquito-busting strategies including fogging and releasing special male Aedes mosquitoes that breed with female mosquitoes to produce eggs that do not hatch.

Commentary: Climate change poses an immediate health crisis for Asia



















Commentary: Why is there another dengue outbreak in Singapore despite all our efforts?













Keeping new and emerging infectious diseases from entering the country, however, is a different ballgame, said experts.
“We're quite lucky because where we're located, we don’t get all the big storms and hurricanes, so we are not as prone to water-borne diseases,” said Associate Professor Yann Boucher from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
“But the problem for Singapore is that because it’s a travel hub, diseases are going to come from some other places,” he added, pointing to diseases such as monkeypox, COVID-19 and Zika which were all imported into the country.
While Singapore has ramped up efforts to boost surveillance of infectious diseases - including testing wastewater - experts CNA spoke to said more needs to be done to understand what is happening in other countries.
Pointing to a Group B Streptococcus outbreak in 2015 in Singapore, which landed more than 160 people in hospital, Assoc Prof Cook highlighted the importance of sharing information.
The same strain had also been reported in freshwater fish in other Southeast Asia countries including Thailand and Vietnam. Subsequently, laboratory investigations found a strong link with consuming raw freshwater fish including raw Asian bighead carp and snakehead, which eventually led Singapore to ban the use of raw freshwater fish in all ready-to-eat raw fish dishes.
“It’s a clear example of how people would benefit from knowing more about what’s happening in other countries,” he said.
Echoing his sentiment, Assoc Prof Boucher said surveillance of infectious diseases needs to be looked at more universally rather than being limited to each country.
“You can't fight an enemy if you don't know what it is,” he said.
“We need to know what's going on in other countries and how the disease could come to Singapore because the disease will appear in other places and then, through travel, it could appear here.”
“The pandemic was a wake-up call for many countries, but you also need the public to buy in that this is a worthwhile endeavour and to support efforts to ramp up surveillance to monitor the spread of diseases,” he added.
GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
Beyond stepping up surveillance, Singapore has also made infrastructural changes to help mitigate the spread of diseases.
This includes ensuring proper ventilation in buildings and having a good drainage system to prevent water-borne diseases.
In 2005, after a large dengue outbreak, the country also modified its building codes to ban roof gutters on new buildings, in a bid to reduce sites for mosquitoes to lay their eggs.
However, as temperatures continue to climb, experts said infectious diseases as well as heat-related health risks will only worsen.
“With more droughts and a couple of degrees hotter, there's going to be a greater risk of fires and so, over a long period of time, it will be similar to being a smoker because there's always more pollution in the air,” said Professor Dale Fisher from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.
“During haze, we also know that hospitals fill up because people are wheezing, coughing and short of breath, so it definitely provokes acute players of disease and people with chronic disease and asthma,” he added.
This will place greater pressure on Singapore’s healthcare resources in the long term, with the country already facing challenges such as an ageing population and the growing overuse of antibiotics, he said.
Ultimately, experts said the focus should be on slashing emissions to address the problem of climate change.
“We can build buildings so that the airflow doesn't go between apartments to reduce transmission and other solutions to manage the spread of infectious diseases but these do not eliminate the problem,” said Assoc Prof Boucher.
“If we don't think long term and start cutting down our carbon emissions then, it’s going to be much worse in the future,” he added.
“We need to take better care of our environment and realise that what we do to our environment will affect us.”"

"Former BSI Bank deputy CEO issued 10-year prohibition order, 24-month conditional warning ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bsi-bank-deputy-ceo-prohibition-order-1mdb-scandal-mas-spf-2999731,"SINGAPORE: The former deputy CEO and head of private banking of BSI Bank Limited's Singapore branch (BSIS) Raj Sriram was on Monday (Oct 10) issued a 10-year prohibition order and a 24-month conditional warning.
Mr Sriram contributed to BSIS' failure to file suspicious transaction reports for transactions related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement.
The prohibition order, which took effect on Monday, was issued by MAS, while the conditional warning was from SPF's Commercial Affairs Department (CAD).
The prohibition order bans Mr Sriram from ""providing any financial advisory service or taking part in the management of, acting as a director of, or becoming a substantial shareholder of any financial advisory firm under the Financial Advisers Act"", said the joint statement.
CAD investigated Mr Sriram in relation to his role in BSIS' business dealings and relationships with the subsidiaries of 1MDB and Aabar Investments PJS Limited, the purported subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi-based Aabar Investments PJS.
SPF and MAS said the department found that there were ""reasonable grounds for BSIS to file suspicious transaction reports in respect of 1MDB-related transactions"" as required under an MAS notice for merchant banks on the prevention of money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.
Due to Mr Sriram’s neglect, BSIS did not file the reports, the statement said.
SPF and MAS said that, in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, CAD issued a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution to Mr Sriram for two offences under the MAS Act.
Under the warning, Mr Sriram paid a sum of S$150,000 to the Singapore Government's Consolidated Fund and committed to refrain from criminal conduct for a period of 24 months.
He will also continue to cooperate with CAD in its 1MDB-related investigations and will not accept any directorship positions or positions of similar substance or form for a period of four years from Sep 6, 2021.
The statement also said that Mr Sriram's conduct warranted a 10-year prohibition order as he held a senior position at BSIS and his neglect had contributed to BSIS' failure to file the suspicious transaction reports. 
Ms Ho Hern Shin, deputy managing director of financial supervision at MAS, said: ""BSIS, of which Mr Sriram was deputy CEO and head of private banking, was a key conduit for tainted funds in the 1MDB debacle.""
Ms Ho noted that MAS withdrew BSIS' licence in May 2016 due to ""serious and repeated breaches"" of laws to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
The ultimate responsibility for ensuring a financial institution’s compliance with such laws and regulations rests with its board of directors and senior management, she added.
SPF and MAS said that they take a serious view of compliance with these laws and the filing of suspicious transaction reports.
CAD director David Chew said: ""The suspicious transaction reporting regime is a key pillar of Singapore’s approach to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.
""The Singapore authorities will not hesitate to take firm action against reporting entities, or their officers, who intentionally or negligently fail to file suspicious transaction reports when legally obliged to do so.""

Former BSI banker banned for life by MAS over US$5 million in ‘secret profits’ linked to 1MDB scandal













MAS previously imposed financial penalties of S$13.3 million on BSIS when it withdrew BSIS' merchant bank licence in 2016.
In 2020, it also issued lifetime prohibitions orders against Mr Kevin Michael Swampillai, a former representative and head of the wealth management services department of BSIS, for his role in the 1MDB scandal that saw him receive US$5 million in ""secret profits"".
1MDB was a sovereign fund set up in 2009 with the help of Malaysian financier Jho Low to promote economic development.
Najib Razak, who was Malaysia's prime minister from 2009 to 2018, co-founded 1MDB and chaired its advisory board until 2016.
1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds for use in investment projects and joint ventures between 2009 and 2013.
Conducting its largest ever kleptocracy investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) said that US$4.5 billion was diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies, many linked to Low.
Malaysian authorities say that billions more remain unaccounted for."
"Singapore to review housing policies, leave measures to encourage more people to have children: DPM Wong","Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also said the Government will look into retirement adequacy for seniors and make it a key priority to reduce income inequality. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-housing-policy-leave-helping-families-elderly-social-mobility-lawrence-wong-2999646,"SINGAPORE: The Government will review housing policies and leave measures to better support Singaporeans in starting families, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Monday (Oct 10).
Speaking at a Forward Singapore conversation for social service practitioners, Mr Wong set out the direction for social policies on strengthening families, supporting seniors and improving social mobility in Singapore.
He also promised to look into retirement adequacy for the elderly and to make narrowing income inequality a key priority.
On the issue of encouraging young families to have more children, Mr Wong noted that long wait times for new HDB flats and rising resale home prices are key concerns for many young Singaporeans.
""This is partly due to the disruptions in the building programme brought about by COVID-19 and the pandemic in the two-and-a-half years. But HDB has been ramping up the supply of new flats and will be able to launch more flats to meet the demand soon,"" said Mr Wong.
""In addition, we will also review our housing policies to see how we can help first-time home buyers secure a flat quickly and affordably.""
To help parents better balance work and family commitments, the Government will also encourage flexible work arrangements and review leave measures.
""This is under review,"" Mr Wong said. ""It does not mean that we will do everything – because we have to take into consideration all the constraints and needs of different stakeholders.""
In addition, Singapore will consider how financial support schemes for parents can be enhanced, and review and adjust existing marriage and parenthood measures.
""We must make Singapore the best place for families – a society where young couples feel well-supported to start and raise a family, and can give their children the best possible start in life,"" said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
He urged fathers to be more involved in parenting, nothing that in most families here, mothers still bear the larger share of caring for the children. Singapore should aim for more equal sharing of parental responsibilities, said Mr Wong.
""This is not something that we can change through policies alone. Ultimately, it's about how we can engender a broader mindset shift in individual attitudes as well as societal norms,"" he added.
Another major area is support for children in their early years, said Mr Wong, assuring parents that more will be done to invest in pre-school education. He promised that fees at government-funded pre-schools will become more affordable and be eventually similar to what parents pay for primary school and after-school care.
""We will take some time to get there ... but this is what we are working towards,"" he said.

SUPPORTING SENIORS
Another key area of focus is supporting seniors, as Singapore is one of the fastest-ageing nations in the world. By 2030, 1 million citizens, or one in four Singaporeans, will be aged 65 and above.
""We must take better care of our seniors – to help them live independently for as long as possible and to live active and meaningful lives, contributing to society – at work, or in the community,"" Mr Wong said.
Touching on the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system, he noted that while it has worked well so far, it faces challenges as the nature of work is changing. For instance, more people have taken up gig work.
""We must continue to evolve and update our CPF system ... it will require not just moves on the CPF front, but also on wages. And that’s something we will study and discuss further with our tripartite partners,"" said Mr Wong.
""Meanwhile, our current seniors have not had the runway to benefit as much from enhancements to the CPF system, such as Workfare and the extra interest rates. We will see how to further strengthen retirement support for them, including those with low or less stable incomes.""
Mr Wong said that while Singapore has improved its healthcare and eldercare system, there is an urgent need to transform the care and living options for seniors.
Several ministries are already working together to develop better senior living options in housing estates and scale them nationwide, he said.
This should complement an extensive network of community and eldercare services ""within easy reach"" in all neighbourhoods.

SOCIAL MOBILITY
Mr Wong said that further reducing income inequality in Singapore and sustaining social mobility is yet another key priority for him.
He noted that for children born in the 1980s, 14 per cent of those whose parents earn the bottom one-fifth of incomes reached the top fifth of their cohort by their 30s. This percentage is higher than many advanced economies and twice as high as the United States.
""But any society which has been stable for a long time tends to stratify and become less socially mobile. In particular, we know that lower-income families today face more challenges,"" he said.
There are some signs that social stratification is becoming more entrenched, with more families with young children staying in rental flats, Mr Wong pointed out.
There are no ""magic bullets"", but he said Singapore has to ""refresh and update"" its approach to providing social support.
""What we have learned is that to help lower-income families sustain progress, our social services need to be delivered in a more holistic manner. We need to provide more integrated, wraparound support, tailored to the family’s unique circumstances and needs,"" he said.
Asking the more than 200 attendees from the social service sector to contribute their ideas, he said: ""We are also open to new ideas to encourage lower-income families towards better life outcomes, empowering them to achieve success on their own terms.""
Following Mr Wong's speech, several social service practitioners rose to ask questions and give suggestions from expanding mentoring programmes, having later school start times to ways to better coordinate social services.
Mr Wong welcomed the suggestions and promised to look into some, while pointing out that there are programmes or pilots in most of these areas.
In his closing remarks, he asked for more feedback and suggestions: ""I'm sharing with you some of our preliminary thoughts but we are wanting to also get your feedback, your input on how we think the social service sector can improve and can be better for our next 10 years and beyond ... the dialogue shouldn't stop just here."""
Singapore Airlines says pregnant cabin crew may choose to work temporary ground jobs,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-airlines-pregnant-cabin-crew-temporary-ground-jobs-arrangement-2999551,"SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) stewardesses who are pregnant can now take on ground jobs up until they give birth, in a departure from the previous practice of having to quit flying for the carrier.
An SIA spokesperson on Monday (Oct 10) said that cabin crew who are expecting may choose to work in temporary ground attachments from the time they declare their pregnancy, till before delivery. 
This may range between a minimum of three months to nine months, said the spokesperson, adding that SIA ""supports our cabin crew during and after their pregnancy"".
After giving birth and taking their maternity leave, cabin crew will be able to resume their flying duties, according to the SIA statement sent to CNA.
""We continue to work hard to retain our talented people, and invest in them, so that they can deliver the world-class service that SIA is renowned for,"" said the airline's spokesperson. 
The Straits Times on Monday reported that the move - in place since July - stops SIA's ""longstanding practice of effectively ending cabin crew's contracts when they are with child"". 
In 2010, the daily broadsheet noted that unlike most other carriers, SIA asks its flight attendants to leave the company after their first trimester of pregnancy - unless they can secure ground jobs, which were difficult to get.
In lieu of maternity benefits, pregnant cabin crew would receive an ex-gratia payment amounting to two months of their basic salary when they resigned, according to the Straits Times in 2010."
Lawyer suspended for acting as supervisor to trainees when he was unqualified,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-suspended-acting-supervisor-trainees-when-he-was-unqualified-iris-koh-clarence-lun-yaodong-2999521,"SINGAPORE: A lawyer was on Monday (Oct 10) handed an 18-month suspension for acting as supervising solicitor to two practice trainees when he was not qualified.
Mr Clarence Lun Yaodong, who represented Healing The Divide's Iris Koh, was handed the sanction by the Court of Three Judges comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, Tay Yong Kwang and Woo Bih Li.
The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) had brought several charges against Mr Lun, who was a solicitor of eight years' standing at the time in 2021.
Mr Lun admitted acting as the supervising solicitor for two individuals, Mr Lim Teng Jie and Ms Trinisha Ann Sunil at different periods during their practice training at Foxwood LLC between October 2019 and January 2020. 
However, Mr Lun was not qualified to act as a supervising solicitor at that time, a clear breach of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011. After he found out that he did not have the relevant qualifications, he purportedly continued to have his trainees work for him and pressed Ms Sunil to pay for her notice period when she wanted to leave.
Monday's hearing was to determine the sanction on Mr Lun. His lawyer, Mark Seah of Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, said a fine would be ""more appropriate"" than a suspension. LawSoc's lawyer, Mr Sarbjit Singh Chopra, asked for a suspension of less than a year.
The main point of contention on Monday's hearing was how long it took Mr Lun from the time he realised he was not qualified to be a supervising solicitor to the point when he told the practice trainees.
The exact time was not determined, with Mr Lun's lawyer said his client could not remember. He opened by saying this was not a case that warrants disciplinary action, but the Chief Justice took issue with this.
""So you think it's OK for a solicitor to take on persons as trainees when they are not qualified?"" asked Chief Justice Menon. ""How can it possibly not be conduct unbefitting of a solicitor to take on people you know you do not have the ability to supervise?""
He stressed the harm done to one of the trainees, Mr Lim, who ""effectively wasted six weeks at the very start of his career"" because his stint with Mr Lun did not count.
Mr Lim also had to run around to find arrangements so he could be in time to be called to the bar during Mass Call.
There was harm also to the law firm's clients, as the whole point for having a qualified solicitor supervise a trainee is to make sure the trainee is being trained and also to protect the clients, said Chief Justice Menon.
He pointed to the records where Mr Lun was chasing one of the trainees to finish his submissions, and chasing the other trainee to finish her work before she left.
LawSoc's lawyer emphasised that Mr Lun had a seeming tendency to push the blame to other people. He said the disciplinary tribunal had found that Mr Lun ""didn't care"", and that his ""careless attitude"" was why everyone was gathered in court on Monday.
The Chief Justice said the minute Mr Lun found out ""out of the blue"" that he was not qualified and nobody else in his firm was qualified to act as a supervising solicitor, he should have put ""a dead stop to everything"" and not allow his practice trainees to continue doing work.
""We don't see any sign of that,"" said Chief Justice Menon. ""In fact, till the end of January, he was chasing the trainees to do work. Where's the client's interests in this?""
Justice Woo chimed in to say that Mr Lun's inability to recollect exactly when he informed the law firm's director that he was unqualified did not reflect well on him.
""Because this is supposed to be such an important discovery, and he doesn't try to persuade the disciplinary tribunal that he acted promptly. We are left to guess all this,"" said Justice Woo.
Chief Justice Menon pointed out that Mr Lun already knew that nobody in the firm could act as a supervising solicitor for the trainees, but still asked one of the trainees to make payment for her notice period after she decided to leave the law firm for unrelated personal reasons.
Mr Lun later made restitution to the trainee, after the matter blew up and was referred to a disciplinary tribunal.
The court ordered costs of S$10,000 to be paid to LawSoc, and allowed Mr Lun to begin his suspension on Nov 7 this year, after he finishes a trial that month."
"Couples in Singapore want to have 2 or more kids, but many don’t due to high costs, stress: Survey","The 2021 Marriage and Parenthood Survey also found that a significant proportion of single respondents have never dated and are not proactive in dating.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/marriage-couples-children-dating-singapore-population-survey-2999056,"SINGAPORE: While the desire to get married and have children remain strong among Singaporeans, many married couples have fewer children than they want to, according to findings from a survey on marriage and parenthood. 
The 2021 Marriage and Parenthood Survey, released by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) on Monday (Oct 10), found that there is a mismatch between aspirations and reality when it comes to forming a family in Singapore.
Nine in 10 of the married couples surveyed (92 per cent) said they would prefer to have two or more children, but in reality, about half of them (51 per cent) had fewer than two children.
One of the main reasons for not having more children was financial cost, with 64 per cent of married respondents citing that as one of the top three reasons.
Two other reasons they chose were “raising children in Singapore is too stressful” and “difficult to manage work and family demands”. Couples were also somewhat concerned about a lack of good caregiving arrangements, and some said they had difficulty conceiving.
When it comes to marriage, a majority, or 80 per cent, of young, single respondents - aged 21 to 35 - said that they intend to marry, a slight decline compared to the figure in 2016 (83 per cent) and 2012 (86 per cent).
Three-quarters of the respondents indicated that having a career and raising a family were equally important, and 14 per cent saw family as more important than a career.

















The majority (77 per cent) of singles in the survey also want children. Those who were unsure or did not want children had concerns about the costs of child-raising, a lack of time and energy to care for children, as well as balancing work and family commitments.
Many agreed that flexible work arrangements make it easier for couples to start a family and have more children. Nine in 10 of married respondents said that flexible work would make, or had made it, easier for them to start a family.
The survey was conducted from February to June 2021, and the respondents included 2,848 singles and 3,017 married Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 to 45 years old.
SHIFT IN PERCEIVED GENDER ROLES
The 2021 survey also found a shift in perceived gender roles, with nearly all (99 per cent) married respondents saying that fathers and mothers are equally important as caregivers for children.
The proportion of those who felt that “ideally, the mother should take care of her children full-time” fell to 24 per cent in 2021 for single respondents, down from 40 per cent in 2016. For married couples, it fell to 40 per cent from 56 per cent in 2016, said the NPTD in a press release.











But married women continue to do more at home compared to their husbands, especially when it came to child care. 
On average, women spent about six hours on a normal weekday on childcare, and 10 hours on weekends while men reported an average of 3.6 hours on weekdays and 7.7 hours on weekends. 
The survey found that a smaller proportion of women (59 per cent) were satisfied with the division of domestic labour compared to men (72 per cent).

DATING BEHAVIOUR
According to the findings, half of the singles surveyed were not currently dating, and among them, 38 per cent had never dated before.
The top reasons cited were having a limited social circle (58 per cent) and not having many opportunities to meet potential partners (57 per cent). About half (48 per cent) said they preferred to leave dating to chance.
Single respondents were still most comfortable meeting potential partners through more organic and face-to-face settings, but more were open to meeting their partners online through dating websites and apps.
Among those who were dating, 29 per cent said they met their partner through online channels, a significant increase from 13 per cent in 2016.
Around 58 per cent were comfortable with meeting a partner through online dating websites or apps, compared to 43 per cent in 2016. 
NTPD said that the views from the survey will be taken into consideration as the Government reviews and strengthens marriage and parenthood support measures. 
The research consultants for the survey are sociology professor Paulin Straughan from the Singapore Management University and Dr Mathew Mathews, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies.

This is the latest development in Liew's case since he was charged in November 2020 with one count each of giving false evidence and furnishing false information to a public servant in the case of Ms Parti Liyani, his family's former maid.
Liew, 45, was charged after Ms Parti was convicted and then acquitted of stealing S$34,000 worth of items from the Liews. Liew was among a few of his family members who testified in Ms Parti's trial in a district court, which found her guilty and sentenced her to 26 months' jail.
The High Court overturned her conviction on appeal, with the judge flagging several issues with her case including a break in the chain of evidence. He also noted that Liew was ""a witness who was not only lacking in credibility but also did not take the process of giving testimony seriously”.
Liew is accused of intentionally giving false evidence in July 2018 by testifying during the trial in the State Courts that a cream polo T-shirt and a red blouse belonged to him.
He is also accused of giving a statement at his home to a public servant on Dec 10, 2016, saying that he found ""119 pieces of clothings"" belonging to him, in boxes packed by Ms Parti.
Liew is defended by lawyer Adam Maniam from Drew & Napier, who did not respond to CNA's queries.
Liew is out on bail of S$15,000. He had been scheduled for several pre-trial conferences in court, but several of the latest ones had been rescheduled - including the ones on Jul 29 and Sep 2 this year.
On Friday, Liew's case was heard in chambers. According to notes in the court's system, an adjournment was granted for Liew to be subject to neuropsychological assessments at Raffles Hospital.
The appointments will be in late October and early November this year, with a report likely to be out in early December 2022.
Liew's defence counsel was told to seek regular updates from Raffles Hospital and to update the court on the progress by the next pre-trial conference.
Liew is set to return to court for another pre-trial conference on Dec 9.
If convicted of furnishing false information to a public servant, and if that information is with respect to the commission of an offence, he could be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.
If found guilty of intentionally giving false information in any stage of a judicial proceeding, he could be jailed for up to seven years and fined."
Singapore looking at tiered system for mental health services to cater to different individuals,"Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary outlined efforts to improve mental health in Singapore at this year's CNA Leadership Summit, which throws the spotlight on mental health at work.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-looking-tiered-system-mental-health-services-cater-different-individuals-2999246,"SINGAPORE: Today, a wide range of clinics, centres, and hotlines providing mental health services in Singapore means getting access to support has become easier.
However, for those seeking help, deciding which outlet to turn to might not be so straightforward, as these services are not clearly differentiated for different levels of need.
Speaking at the CNA Leadership Summit on Monday (Oct 10), Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said a proposed care model with a tiered system of services can help to improve accessibility, coordination, and quality of mental health services.

“From being at-risk to coping with difficult circumstances, to having mild illness, or subsequently deteriorating, or more hopefully, recovering, and integrating back into society with a hidden illness or risk,” he said.
“We must not consider these different archetypes and the challenges facing someone at different times of their life as being equivalent.”
Having a tiered system will also help to identify and endorse service providers to look after different groups of clients and patients with different needs, and standardise service provision, referrals, and care coordination, said Dr Puthucheary.
The new care model is one of 12 preliminary recommendations by the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, which was set up in July last year to oversee and coordinate mental health efforts.
It proposes providing a tiered system of services ranging from peer support, general counselling, to more intensive psychological and psychiatric services.
Other recommendations include improving employment support for people with mental health conditions by providing training allowances and partnering companies to increase awareness on resources available.
The task force also recommended enhancing accessibility and the range of services for youth.
Dr Puthucheary said the taskforce is reviewing and analysing the feedback received from the public and will adjust its recommendations accordingly.
This will be incorporated into the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which is set to be published next year."
Lawyer M Ravi calls contempt of court proceedings 'overkill'; AGC says he 'clearly' meant to insult judges,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-m-ravi-calls-contempt-court-proceedings-overkill-agc-says-he-clearly-meant-insult-judges-2999186,"SINGAPORE: State counsel on Monday (Oct 10) urged a court to commit lawyer M Ravi for contempt of court over his conduct in court proceedings where he allegedly insulted two judges and acted without his clients' instructions.
Mr Ravi flew in from the United Kingdom to represent himself after his lawyers from Mr Eugene Thuraisingam's eponymous law firm were discharged on Friday due to disagreements with their client.
Mr Ravi, who has bipolar disorder, said it did not ""dignify the state"" to bring contempt of court proceedings against a vulnerable person. He told the court that the proceedings against him were ""overkill"", saying he was already facing five disciplinary tribunals.
After hearing both sides, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng adjourned the matter to deliberate on her decision. Should Mr Ravi be found in contempt of court, the issue of punishment will be dealt with at a later stage.
The Attorney-General was presented by four state counsel, led by Mr Adrian Loo. He urged the court to grant an order to commit Mr Ravi for contempt of court in two cases: One in the district court against District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt, and one in the high court against Justice Audrey Lim.
In the first case, Mr Ravi allegedly lied to Judge Chay in November 2021 that he could commence trial for a client, confirming that he had no hearings the next day. However, he was actually handling another trial for another client.
The next day, he did not appear for trial until 11am and one of his clients had to represent himself, said Mr Loo.
When the judge asked Mr Ravi why he had taken on two trials, Mr Ravi allegedly claimed that the judge was biased. He did so in front of his client and members of the public who were in the court, said Mr Loo.
The second case was also in November 2021, when Mr Ravi was representing Mr Chua Qwong Meng and other bus drivers accusing SBS Transit of unfair work practices. He made repeated allegations that Justice Lim, who presided over the trial, was biased, said Mr Loo.
Mr Ravi also repeatedly interrupted the judge and told her that he did not trust her explanation.
According to a medical report, Mr Ravi was suffering from a relapse of his bipolar disorder at the time. But Mr Loo said Mr Ravi knew what was going on and that his cognitive abilities were not affected.
""The evidence here is that even though his ability to hold back may have been affected by his mental condition, he clearly intended to say what he said and he meant what he said,"" said Mr Loo.
AGC HOUNDING ME: M RAVI
In his arguments, Mr Ravi said AGC had been ""hounding"" him with investigations. He also alleged that AGC had yet to apologise for their ""threats"" and ""harassment"".
He said he had already been prohibited from practising as a lawyer, but was not allowed to rest while on medical leave from December 2021 to May 2022.
Mr Ravi said the AGC took up ""a lot of applications"" against him while he was on medical leave, adding that five disciplinary tribunals have commenced against him - such that even the Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) ""cannot cope"".
He initially asked to have the hearing adjourned so he could file further arguments on how the Singapore judiciary was ""unprofessional"" due to a lack of security of tenure, and the number of public prosecutors appointed as judges.
But Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said she could continue to hear the case, and might allow him to file his arguments later.
Mr Ravi opened his arguments by saying he had a preliminary application that all the state counsel acting in proceedings against him have acted in contempt of court.
He claimed they came into contact with privileged communications between himself and his paralegal.
The state counsel had breached professional legal privilege, Mr Ravi added, claiming that due process was not followed.
He asked for the entire set of proceedings to be set aside on grounds of a breach of fair trial.
""The crucial question for this court is - how can you treat a vulnerable person (like this) in contempt of court proceedings? The AG acknowledges that I have bipolar disorder. There's enough policy in the courts that a person with mental disorder is a vulnerable person,"" said Mr Ravi.
He said the AG had taken a ""very clinical approach"" by pointing out what he said without recognising that he was a vulnerable person with bipolar disorder.
""I want the court to recognise that I should be given, at the outset, dignity,"" he said. ""A vulnerable person should not be dragged into contempt of court proceedings in this manner. I already have occupational hazards, being an anti-death penalty advocate.""
Mr Ravi said that as lawyers, the prosecutors would be familiar with occupational hazards such as stress.
""I just wish one day they will walk into my shoes and understand how representing 26 inmates (on death row) - the anxiety I go through, even without bipolar disorder, is tremendous!"" said Mr Ravi.
At the time of the alleged contempt of court incidents, Mr Ravi was representing multiple convicts on death row for offences like drugs and murder.
There was ""higher"" anxiety over such cases as the appellants faced death, he said.
He pointed to the ""huge amount of anxiety"" he faced while handling the Court of Appeal case for Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam.
Mr Ravi said he should not be held to a ""crushing standard"", adding that complaints had already been filed against him to various authorities for the matters pertaining to Judge Chay and Justice Lim.
""This is an overkill. It has a crushing effect on a person. It has even more effect when it's a vulnerable person,"" said Mr Ravi, referring to himself.
He said his remarks against the judges were fair criticism, and that he could have been in a state of ""heightened anxiety"" while concerned about protecting his clients' rights and ""labouring under (a relapse of his) bipolar disorder"".
""It does not dignify the state to bring these proceedings against someone who is vulnerable,"" said Mr Ravi. ""Only a sick society would kick a sick person and these proceedings have also violated my right to fair trial.""
On Monday, he also alleged that state counsel Mr Loo had made a joke on a previous occasion at the State Courts, when Mr Ravi was waiting for an update on whether his impounded passport would be released.
He claimed that Mr Loo ""made a laugh"" about Mr Ravi's situation.
Mr Loo said he categorically denied these allegations and that they were irrelevant in any case.
Justice Hoo adjourned the matter and said there might be a pre-trial conference thereafter on further directions."

SBS transit driver dies after bus crashes into tree outside Hougang depot,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sbs-transit-bus-driver-dies-crash-accident-fatal-road-tree-hougang-depot-2998996,"SINGAPORE: A 54-year-old bus driver was found dead on Sunday (Oct 9) morning after crashing into a tree outside Hougang depot. 
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) were alerted to a road traffic accident at around 2.40am on Sunday at 4 Defu Avenue 1. 
""A person found trapped in the driver seat of a bus was extricated by SCDF and pronounced dead by a paramedic,"" added SCDF. 
The bus captain was driving the empty employee bus back to the Hougang depot on Sunday morning when the vehicle lost control and hit a tree outside the bus depot, said Mrs Grace Wu, vice president of Customer Experience and Communications at SBS Transit in response to CNA's queries. 
""We are deeply saddened by his passing and have extended our heartfelt condolences to his family. We are in close contact with them during this very difficult time and will render all support needed,"" she added.
In a video circulating online, a bus is seen with a shattered windscreen after hitting a tree, with SCDF officers at the scene.
Police investigations are ongoing. 
The bus driver's death marked the 39th workplace fatality this year, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a statement on Monday. This exceeds the 37 workplace deaths reported for the whole of last year. 
The Singaporean man had been driving to Hougang Bus Depot to pick up other bus drivers when he crashed into a tree, added the ministry. 
Last month, in response to the string of workplace fatalities this year, the ministry imposed a mandatory safety time-out for the first time.
A higher rate of workplace fatalities was reported in the first half of 2022, even as the number of reported workplace injuries fell. In response, MOM called for a six-month period of heightened safety from Sep 1 to Feb 28, 2023, citing its concerns with the high fatality rate.

"Student fined S$5,000 for flying drone in NTU to take photos of girlfriend",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/student-fined-s5000-fly-drone-ntu-campus-yunnan-garden-take-photos-girlfriend-xu-zi-zhou-2999016,"SINGAPORE: A student who flew a drone at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to take photos of his girlfriend and her friend was fined S$5,000 by a court on Monday (Oct 10) for flouting drone regulations.
Xu Zi Zhou, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of operating an unmanned aircraft without a valid activity permit within 5km of Tengah aerodrome. Another two charges relating to unmanned aircraft operations regulations were taken into consideration.
The court heard that Xu bought a DJI Mavic Air 2 drone from online shopping platform Shopee on May 28, 2021.
Xu, a China national on a student pass, took the 568.5g drone and carried out a few test flights around the National University of Singapore, where he was studying.
On Jun 1, 2021, Xu met his girlfriend and one of her friends and proceeded to Yunnan Garden in NTU.
Xu used the drone to take photographs and videos of his girlfriend and her friend there.
At about 4.30pm that day, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) detected the drone flying at a maximum altitude of 518.37 feet (158m) above mean sea level and within 5km of Tengah aerodrome.
CAAS officers dispatched to Yunnan Garden saw Xu operating the drone and asked him to land it.
Based on the flight logs of the drone, Xu had flown it five times that day with a total flight time of 18 minutes.
According to CAAS' regulations, a Class 2 activity permit is required for unmanned aircraft activities performed outdoors under various conditions. These include: If the drone is to be used for recreational purposes and is 25kg or below in total mass, if the flight is within 5km of any civil aerodrome or military airbase and if the drone is flown at an altitude of higher than 200 feet above mean sea level.
If Xu had applied for such a permit, CAAS would have required him to operate the drone in compliance with safe operating conditions.
For operating an unmanned aircraft within 5km of Tengah aerodrome without a valid activity permit, Xu could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$50,000, or both."
Weekly dengue cases fall by 70% as NEA closes almost all clusters since start of 2022,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dengue-cases-fall-continued-vigilance-remains-critical-nea-2998966,"SINGAPORE: The weekly number of dengue cases has dropped by about 70 per cent from its peak in May, and about 95 per cent of dengue clusters since the start of 2022 have been closed.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) announced these figures on Monday (Oct 10), adding that as of last Friday, there have been more than 28,500 dengue cases this year.
There were 427 dengue cases reported last week, 46 fewer from the week before.
As of last Friday, there are 142 dengue clusters - six fewer than the week before. Over the last three weeks, clusters with hundreds of cases - located at Ghim Moh Road, Bedok Reservoir Road and Clementi Road - have also been closed, said NEA.
The agency said it has closed 2,563 out of 2,705 dengue clusters since the start of this year.
But NEA cautioned that it continues to observe active clusters with a ""relatively fast rate of transmission"", including at Clementi West Street 2, Jurong East Street 21, Jurong West Avenue 5 and Rivervale Crescent.

Singapore may have access to new dengue vaccine in about a year, says veteran infectious diseases expert













In February this year, Singapore experienced early signs of a dengue outbreak with more than 200 weekly cases reported. 
In response, the launch of a National Dengue Prevention Campaign was brought forward and new dengue alert banners put up in areas with persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, said NEA in a media release.
The agency also worked with partners like town councils to conduct about 200,000 inspections in the first half of the year, removing about 51,000 potential mosquito breeding habits. This was on top of 409,000 inspections by NEA islandwide in the same period.
Since July, the agency has also released male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes at eight additional field sites, bringing 1,400 more Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks under Project Wolbachia -  and increasing its coverage to about 31 per cent of all HDB blocks in Singapore.
Under this project, male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will mate with females, causing them to lay eggs that do not hatch, thus reducing the dengue mosquito population.
""Even though we are moving beyond the traditional dengue peak season, continued vigilance remains critical as weekly dengue cases and the Aedes aegypti mosquito population remain high,"" said NEA on Monday.
“Weekly dengue cases could continue to remain high beyond the peak dengue season (June to October) as we still see dengue transmission in many areas across the island.""
These include large clusters at Boon Lay Avenue, Aroozoo Avenue, Hougang Avenue 1, Jelapang Road, Bishan Street 11 and Marine Crescent, said NEA.
The agency added that it continues to work closely with grassroots advisers and community volunteers, to reach out to residents on dengue prevention efforts.
It also urged people to maintain good housekeeping and take measures to bring down dengue case numbers further - including using insect repellent and doing the necessary to curb the mosquito population, such as by changing water in vases."
Tech companies tapping artificial intelligence to treat and predict mental health disorders,"Among the solutions is an app that uses information like user-reported moods and usage patterns to recommend programmes. On Mental Health Day, CNA looks at what is being done in this space. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/artificial-intelligence-mental-health-pills-apps-2998911,"SINGAPORE: Could the future of managing mental health lie in strings of code and predictive models?
Behavioural health tech provider Holmusk is banking on that, partnering authorities in Singapore to develop a suite of digital tools for hospitals and clinics.
One solution the firm is looking to introduce is a “smart pill” to track when patients forget or skip their medication.
How that works, is through a small, grain-sized biosensor embedded within the pill, and a sticky patch on the patient’s body that can detect when the pill is ingested. The technology is approved in the United States.
“Let's say schizophrenia, depression patients with some psychosis – not taking the pill for a few days can be bad enough to drive them off the cliff. And if you knew that they have stopped taking the pill two days in a row, you can intervene. You can catch them early”, chief analytics officer of Holmusk, Joydeep Sarkar, told CNA. 
He described the sensor as a ""fascinating solution"", which will work with other parts of the puzzle - ensuring that the information is fed into the patient’s clinical records, flagging missed doses, and ensuring any necessary intervention is part of the workflow.
The firm has also developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to analyse information from “notes-driven” mental health treatment or therapy. 
This may allow researchers to generate insights into the efficacy of treatments and the progression of disorders at a larger scale in future.
PREDICTING RISKS FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS
Such data in areas like medication and treatment could also feed into predictive models to understand the risks surrounding each patient.
""A big part of where artificial intelligence plays a role is more complex patients - where the answers are not obvious,” Mr Sarkar said.
“Let's say somebody comes in and you stabilise them, and you keep them in the hospital. When is it okay to release them … What support systems could you actually really have in place so that patients don't get worse?”
One disease his firm is looking to zoom in on is bipolar disorder, which has a high genetic component.
The aim is to tap data to identify and track those at risk of developing the disorder to catch the signs early.
""I call them the low-hanging fruit because you don't really need much, (you) just (need) to connect the data”, Mr Sarkar said.
TEACHING PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES
Other industry players are also looking to tap into artificial intelligence to help people take care of their own mental health.
Among them is mental health platform Intellect, which has attracted 3 million users globally since its launch in 2020.
 
“Mental health has long been a very strong need across Asia, in the world. That has been unmet in support. We've seen quite a sharp rise in client service over two years”, said Intellect chief executive Theodoric Chew.
Intellect's app uses information like user-reported moods and usage patterns to recommend programmes to users. It also uses algorithms to match individuals to therapists, based on their needs and specialisations.
The app counts 24-year-old Charis Liang among its users. The undergraduate, who previously worked as an intern at the company, takes to the app for sessions when she's overwhelmed and needs help quickly. 
“You can't call up your therapist at 3am, but you can do this"", she said. Ms Liang said exercises on the app, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, are similar to what she went through at a traditional therapy session with the added ease of being on-demand.

""With … a therapist, you can't really do that because you need to book a time, drive yourself to the office and sometimes there are just barriers between you accessing the resource”, Ms Liang said. 
HURDLES TO CROSS
Despite the perks of tech, Intellect provides therapy rooms in its office as an option for those who still prefer physical sessions over virtual consultations, with a belief that human touch is still indispensable in mental health care. 
Also, with the sensitive nature of mental health issues, confidentiality is a major consideration for both users and providers.
“We use something called zero-knowledge encryption, which means that the data is only on a person's device and no one else - employers can't see, we can't see,"" Mr Chew said 
“We always ensure their privacy. And that creates a lot much more trust.""
Besides privacy, another challenge is explainability, Holmusk's Mr Sarkar.
This refers to being able to make sense of AI recommendations. 
Tech companies, he said, will have to collaborate with clinicians and health authorities to look at requirements necessary for safety, and study the implications carefully.
“If I'm recommending a YouTube video, I don't need to know why the AI chose that YouTube video because there are no consequences of you not liking a YouTube video, but the consequences are far more acute in the healthcare setting,” Mr Sarkar said."
"The Big Read: As health consciousness rises, can a nation of foodies live with less sugar, salt and all things nice?",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthier-sg-less-sugar-salt-sodium-diet-hawker-centres-nutrition-2996756,"SINGAPORE: Post-graduate student Imran Khan decided to pay more attention to his diet after coming across advertisements on the nation’s war against diabetes three years ago.
Increased news coverage of Singaporeans suffering from diabetes also spurred the 26-year-old to improve his eating habits — out of fear that he, too, may end up with the disease that has affected about 14.2 per cent of the adult population here, according to the latest figures by the International Diabetes Federation. 
“I’m becoming more health conscious with age … and the extensive news coverage on the government’s efforts in its war against sugar and salt makes me more aware about my choices,” he said. 
Apart from including more fruits and vegetables in his diet, Mr Imran also started eating salads from his university canteen at least twice a week this year, which according to him has helped him to become more alert and feel better. 
Unlike Mr Imran, 32-year-old Muhammad Nur Hidayat does not have the luxury of picking healthier food options. 
Working long shifts which range from nine hours on weekdays to 14 hours on weekends, as well as juggling parental duties and fetching his wife to and from work, has left the delivery rider with little time to prepare his own meals. 
“When I feel that time is not in my favour, I tend to be less picky and eat what I find is convenient and easy,” said Mr Hidayat. 
He often ends up eating fast food or cooked Malay dishes from hawker centres and food courts daily. 
The likes of Mr Hidayat are among those whom the Government is targeting in its efforts to improve population health, as part of the new Healthier SG programme that focuses on promoting preventive care.

First announced by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung during his ministry’s Budget debate in March, the programme will be rolled out from next year.
Earlier this week, during a debate on Healthier SG’s White Paper, Mr Ong said that the Government intends to increase its budget on preventive care.
“In making these investments, our main and primary motivation is to reduce disease burden and reduce the suffering of people and their loved ones,” he said. 
These investments would go into a slew of new measures under the programme, such as allowing Singaporeans to choose and enrol with a family doctor and higher subsidies for drugs targeting common chronic diseases at clinics.

In Parliament on Wednesday (Oct 5), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung wrapped up the two-day debate on Building a Healthier SG. He and Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary then fielded clarifications sought by members of the House. The motion on the White Paper on Healthier SG was passed.









In line with the nation’s shift towards preventive care, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) also announced on Sep 28 its target to bring down sodium consumption among Singaporeans by 15 per cent over five years, to help tackle the prevalence of hypertension. 
More than a third of Singaporeans suffer from high blood pressure, according to the National Population Health Survey in 2020. 
The HPB’s plan includes making healthier salt and seasoning products more readily available to consumers and encouraging food and beverage operators to adopt these healthier options.

This follows its latest nutrition survey in 2018, which found that despite an improvement in Singaporeans’ diet quality, high amounts of salt and sugar intake still remain a problem.
According to the survey, many Singaporeans were consuming more fruits and vegetables, as well as substituting saturated fats with unsaturated ones. 
They were also consuming fewer calories, dropping 5 per cent from 2,600kcal in 2010 to 2,470kcal in 2018. 
However, Singaporeans were still consuming a high amount of sugar and salt, with their total sugar intake increasing to 60g in 2018, from 59g in 2010. 
For salt intake, 90 per cent of Singaporeans exceeded the recommended amount of 5g per day, with the average daily salt intake in 2018 at 9g. 
This was contributed mostly by seasonings, salt and sauces added during food preparation such as stir-frying or marinating, which make up 75 per cent of salt in the diet.
The new measures will complement HPB’s current programmes to encourage Singaporeans to develop healthier eating habits. 
The Healthier Dining Programme (HDP), for example, was started in 2014 to encourage F&B businesses to provide healthier food and drink options by providing them with grants and support. 
The scheme was then expanded in 2017 to include stalls at hawker centres and coffee shops. The aim was to have four in 10 of these stalls selling at least one healthier dish by 2019.

As of March this year, the proportion was six in 10 (or about 7,000 out of the total number of hawker centre and coffee shop stalls), said HPB in response to TODAY's queries. It added that in all, about 3,000 F&B operators, hawker centres and coffee shops, with more than 12,000 touchpoints and stalls islandwide, have joined the programme.
Healthier dishes could include those with lower calories, lower sugar or higher amounts of whole grains. 
Separately, there is also the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) programme, where healthier packaged food and drinks are labelled with an HCS logo.
As of March, more than 4,500 HCS products were available across various food categories, such as packaged beverages, rice, noodles, bread and sauces, said HPB. 
A SNAPSHOT OF SINGAPOREANS’ EATING HABITS 
After Ms Tjut Rostina Said Arby, 42, realised that she had put on 8kg during the pandemic — a result of increased snacking and a lack of activity when she and her family were spending more time at home — she knew that it was time to change her diet. 
“I’ve been overweight for the most part of my life and the pandemic made it worse,” said the mother of two. She weighed around 80kg before the pandemic. 
She then shed 16kg in around 10 months after removing processed food and introducing healthier ingredients such as brown rice and wholemeal bread into her diet, as well as controlling her food portions. 
The greatest joy that she has derived from the switch in diet is having the stamina and strength to do the activities she loves now, “without passing out halfway”, said Ms Tjut Rostina, who enjoys taking long walks and visiting indoor playgrounds with her kids.  
Although the communications manager has her lunches outside when she is working, she would typically go for healthier options such as poke bowls or a plate of brown rice with vegetables and protein.

University student Auston Lim also dines out almost every day, and has most of his meals on the school campus. 
But unlike Ms Tjut Rostina, the 21-year-old said that he eats whatever he wants as he is not very health conscious. 
“Personally as a student, it can be quite stressful in terms of my studies, so indulging in food that I want to eat kind of relieves some stress,” said Mr Lim, who is a big fan of hawker food as the price and taste is “incomparable”. 
On the other hand, digital content creator Namita Sinha cooks at home every day, save for the weekends.  
Ms Namita would use healthier ingredients such as adding grated carrot, beetroot and cauliflower in the roti prata which she prepares for her children. 
The 35-year-old mother said that it gets challenging and difficult at times to cook every day, but she manages by preparing what needs to be cooked for the week in advance. 
Adhering to a healthy diet has also become second nature for 27-year-old Daniel Tan.
The personal trainer told TODAY that he has been conscious about his diet since he was in junior college, as he wanted to improve his fitness and look better. 
His meals would usually consist of a significant amount of protein, vegetables and whole grains. 
Mr Tan, who sometimes works irregular hours, would usually bulk purchase 2kg of frozen chicken breasts online and thaw them whenever he wants to have a quick lunch at home. 
He added that he would still dine at hawker centres at least a few times a week, but would often order chicken rice and request for chicken breast and extra cucumber slices. 
Indeed, when it comes to food, hawker centres and coffee shops are a big part of the typical Singaporean lifestyle, with many regularly consuming their daily meals from these places. 
On their part, hawkers interviewed by TODAY said that they are seeing more health-conscious customers who would request for their dishes to be “healthier”, such as adding less salt or soya sauce. 
Mr Jonathan Tan, who has been running his Kin Men Seng Heng stall at Amoy Street Food Centre for the past seven months, said that he had to reduce the sodium in his original recipe by 10 per cent within the first month of opening his store due to feedback from customers. 
The third-generation hawker uses a family recipe passed down from his grandfather who ran a hawker stall at Redhill in the 1970s. 
The recipe he received from his uncle already had a 20 per cent reduction in sodium from his grandfather’s version. 
“If I were to pass (the recipe) down to my kid and future grandkids, chances are sodium is just gonna be reduced even more. It’s only a matter of time until people are more educated and more aware of what they put in their mouth, then they will definitely choose healthier choices,” said the 27-year-old. 
However, he said that making a dish healthier is more difficult, citing factors such as costs and keeping the original recipe as authentic as possible.

Similarly, 46-year-old hawker Alan Goh, who runs the Ang Mo Kio 453 Wanton Mee stall at Mayflower Food Centre, said that he has reduced the amount of oil and salt in his dishes as “that is the only way to bring back customers” since many are more health conscious now. 
He also reduces the amount of soya sauce and salt in his dishes upon customers’ requests, though there are a handful who return to tell him that there is “no taste”. 
“Then we will have to explain to them that if you want your food to be tasty, it will definitely be more oily and salty,” said Mr Goh. 
Mr Haziq Halim, 35, who runs the Ché Ani Chicken Rice stall at Bukit Batok, said that such requests for less salt and soya sauce are more than welcome.
“They help me to save money ... nothing to complain (about),"" he told TODAY with a laugh. 
But for Mr Daren Lionel Oliveiro, making his dishes healthy does require extra time and cost. 
Still, the 41-year-old founder of Butternut and AngMohZiChar at Taman Jurong Food Centre sees it as a necessary sacrifice. 
“I myself am in the age range where there is (greater) risk of chronic illnesses … since I'm doing food, I can impact the way I, my family and customers eat,” he said. 
For instance, Mr Oliveiro uses carrots and onions to bring out the natural sweetness instead of using sugar or canned sauce for his pasta. 
This helps him reduce 1kg of sugar for each batch of sauce, which serves around 50 plates. 
However, these extra ingredients and manpower to prepare the sauce from scratch would incur an additional cost of around 42 per cent as compared to simply using canned ready-made pasta sauces.

HOW HEALTHY IS THE TYPICAL S'POREAN DIET? 
A typical Singaporean diet revolves around hawker culture, with people consuming a variety of food from all three major ethnic groups, said Dr Kalpana Bhaskaran, who heads the Glycemic Index Research Unit at Temasek Polytechnic. 
Dr Kalpana is also the president of the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association. 
“In a day, a typical Singaporean may have kaya toast for breakfast, followed by lunch at an economic rice stall and a home-cooked dinner. Most of the meals are accompanied by hot or cold beverages,” she said. 
A sizable proportion of Singaporeans eat out on a regular basis, noted Dr Kalpana, citing a poll on Singaporeans’ eating habits done by Nielsen this year which found that one in four Singaporeans eat out daily. 
“While hawker centres provide us with inexpensive and excellent cuisine, and also healthier choice hawker items, some items are still typically rich in salt and oil, and are quite unhealthy when consumed frequently,” said Dr Kalpana, adding that this becomes a bigger issue when consumers do not choose the healthier options.

Agreeing, food science and nutrition lecturer Claudine Loong from Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) said: “Even as Singaporeans are more conscious about the volumes and types of food, I think salt and sugar are more insidious.”
These condiments are present in convenient food, such as processed meats and fish, which can be easy to miss while having a meal. 
“Many busy people also choose not to cook and rely on flavourful restaurant takeaways or deliveries. Usually you don’t get to control the sugar or salt used in these preparations,” Ms Loong added.   
Dr Mary Chong, from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that she has noticed a greater awareness among Singaporeans on the importance of having a healthy diet.
However, whether they turn this awareness into action depends on factors such as social support and convenience. 
Those who eat healthier tend to have more opportunities to cook for themselves at home, said Dr Chong, whose research interests include diet and lifestyle behaviours. 
For instance, people working at home during the pandemic may have taken on a more proactive approach in changing their diet. 
They may have more social support as well, such as grandparents and helpers who help to prepare home-cooked food when they are unable to do so themselves. 
However, Ms Loong noted that as people return to working in the office as the pandemic situation improved, such proactiveness to prepare home-cooked food seems to have waned. 
“As we return to our lifestyles and with a busy day, the motivation to prepare and cook is not quite as strong. So, we opt for the takeaways or the deliveries, or the quick meal at the hawker centre or food court,” she said. 
“COVID-19 also meant that there was a bloom of restaurants joining food delivery services, and that has meant more choices at our fingertips, and the habit of ordering is perhaps now more ingrained.” 
However, food delivery companies told TODAY that despite an increased number of customers on their platforms, there seems to be a growing consciousness towards healthier choices. 
A spokesperson from Deliveroo said: “In the last two years, Deliveroo has seen a significant increase in orders for our ‘Healthy’ and ‘Healthy Options’ categories. Popular healthy dishes include salads, poke bowls and wraps.” 
Similarly, a foodpanda spokesperson said that there has been an increase in people choosing healthier options since the pandemic. This extends beyond food deliveries to include grocery and other orders.
DOES SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS HAVE ANY BEARING? 
Cleaning up one’s diet does come with a price tag, said those who have started eating more healthily. 
""Right now, I'm working so I think I can afford to spend slightly more in terms of eating healthy food,” said Mr Imran, the post-graduate student. “But I have to agree that sometimes the pre-packaged salads are relatively expensive.""
Food operators, too, had previously told TODAY that higher ingredient prices are among their top concerns when offering a healthier menu, even as they grapple with other soaring costs such as rental and manpower.
Hence, it was not surprising that during the debate over the Healthier SG White Paper, Members of Parliament (MPs) from both sides of the aisle stressed the importance of paying attention to the lower-income segment in the community.
MP Xie Yao Quan (PAP-Jurong) said that Healthier SG needs to be inclusive socio-economically. He added that he had wished to see “specific mention of how we plan to support our lower-income segments through additional differentiated measures” in the White Paper, given that these groups tend to exhibit poorer health outcomes.
The 2020 National Population Health Survey report, published in November last year, indicated a consistently higher crude prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and high blood cholesterol among residents whose highest education qualification was primary school, compared to those with secondary or post-secondary qualifications.
“Analysis based on (the) highest education attained served as a proxy to socio-economic factors,” said the report, although it did not indicate any causation in the trend. 
Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa, from the Progress Singapore Party, and MP Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied) in their respective speeches zoomed in on the importance of making healthier food choices and ingredients more affordable.
Addressing such concerns, Senior Parliamentary Secretary of Health Rahayu Mahzam said: “HPB also works actively with supermarket chains to introduce more Healthier Choice Symbol products to increase the variety of HCS house brand products which are typically more affordable than branded alternatives.”
In its response to TODAY, HPB said that as of March, there were more than 4,500 HCS products available across 100 food categories, such as packaged beverages, rice, noodles, bread and sauces.

HPB also highlighted its Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme, which offers grants to encourage food manufacturers to develop healthier ingredient products. 
“By March 2022, 95 suppliers across nine ingredient categories were on board the scheme, offering over 300 healthier ingredient products,” it said.
Nevertheless, TODAY’s checks at major retail stores found that there is still a jarring price disparity between healthier ingredients and regular ones.
For example, the cheapest five-litre bottle of vegetable cooking oil was sold at a supermarket for S$12.95. The cheapest bottle with a HCS label was priced 30 per cent higher at S$17.
A 5kg bag of house brand white rice cost S$6.20, while the cheapest bag of mixed brown and white rice half its weight was priced at S$7.20 — or 2.3 times as much when compared per gram.
Regular salt costs around S$0.40 for a 500g pack, or S$1.40 for a 3kg bag. The cheapest sodium salt costs slightly under S$4 for 215g.
Despite the higher prices, a spokesperson from FairPrice told TODAY that there has been an increase in sales for healthier choice products by more than 10 per cent from 2019 to 2022. 
She added that the company has increased the number of healthier choice products in stores by about 10 per cent over the past year. 
The experts interviewed acknowledged that socio-economic status does influence diet choices, and disparities in diet are especially compounded by soaring food prices.
“While the total spending for food has increased across all households, the proportion of food cost to household income is grossly disproportionate for affluent versus underprivileged households,” said Dr Kalpana, adding that such a trend is common across the globe.
Dr Chong from NUS said that lower-income families sometimes do their marketing periodically to buy in bulk and cut down costs, and may forgo healthy food items such as fruits and vegetables if supplies run out in between.
Both she and NYP’s Ms Loong also said that due to the higher prices, less-affluent families may be able to access fewer healthier food options, compared with high-income earners.
Ms Loong said that lower-income groups tend to gravitate towards cheaper, processed and less healthy foods.
She said: “Fresh food insufficiency is also more prevalent among this group, due to the cost. Budget for food is often the least prioritised, compared to other (necessities)”.
Nevertheless, the experts noted that there are government-led and ground-up initiatives in place to make healthier food more accessible to the low-income. These include HPB's programmes and community pantries that offer free basic food items to the needy.
At the individual level, Dr Kalpana said one can also make low-cost tweaks such as cutting down unhealthy food and replacing sugary beverages with plain water in order to improve their diet.
“My view is more than socio-economic status, what needs to be addressed is determining the best methods in changing nutritional behavior, including helping people make informed diet choices,” she said.
HEALTHY DIET IMPORTANT, BUT ISN’T EVERYTHING IN PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE 
Singapore’s ageing population is one of the factors driving the Government’s “long-term and profound reform effort” of adopting preventive care, Health Minister Ong told Parliament on Tuesday. 
Preventive healthcare consists of measures — including adopting a healthy diet — taken to prevent illnesses and the onset of diseases. 
“Our society is ageing rapidly, to reduce the disease burden and preserve the quality of life of our people in the coming years, we have to become healthier,” he said.
About one in four Singaporeans will be aged over 65 by 2030, up from one in six today. 
Mr Ong added that the rise in healthcare spending cannot be reversed due to an ageing population. 
“But what we can hope for is to slow down the rate of increase of healthcare spending,” he said. 
Of the many components in preventive healthcare, Dr Kalpana said that having a healthy diet is of “paramount importance”, as minor changes can help to prevent chronic diseases. 
“For example, eating fewer calories will lead to weight loss and lowering certain fats and cholesterol and adding whole grains to a diet can help prevent atherosclerosis (plaque build-up in the arteries), which can lead to heart disease or stroke. Reducing sodium levels in your diet will also reduce the risk of hypertension,” she said. 
HPB, too, said that healthy eating is one of the key focuses in preventive health efforts to address key lifestyle risk factors, which can lead to poor health and chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. 
According to Dr Kalpana, other components of preventive healthcare include:
Regular screening for chronic diseases
Taking the right steps to quit smoking or stop alcohol abuse
Leading a healthy lifestyle
Weight management
Regular vaccination
Communication with one’s healthcare provider to discuss about medicines/supplements that one should take 
TIPS ON HEALTHY EATING — ORGANIC FOOD NOT NECESSARILY HEALTHIER
While healthier food options still tend to cost higher, the experts said that eating well and right does not require one to break the bank or devote a lot of effort to it.
Dr Kalpana said: “People have this misconception that in order to eat healthily, they would need to buy organic foods and specialty products that are expensive.” 
And despite the widespread perception that organic food is healthier, this is not necessarily the case. 
“While organic foods have fewer synthetic pesticides and fertilisers and are free of hormones and antibiotics, they do not have a nutritional advantage compared to non-organic types,” said Dr Kalpana. 
Instead, a cost-effective way of eating healthier could include small changes, such as cutting out foods that are high in sodium or avoiding sugary beverages and drinking water instead.

NUS' Dr Chong also suggested buying groceries in bulk, which could lower their overall cost. 
“I know of communities and flats where they will get orders from different neighbours and do group buys. This is quite a nice social-driven group effort,” she said.  
She added that buying frozen vegetables or meat, in addition to fresh ones, could be another way of eating healthy yet saving on costs, as they would be able to last longer. 
She said that she herself has the practice of bringing food from home to work. For example. buying fruits on an ad-hoc basis would cost her more than if she were to buy them in bulk from the supermarket. 
“All that takes a bit more effort. But it goes a long way in saving. If every day you save 20 to 30 cents then in a whole week you can save quite a bit,” she said. 
Another way to reduce food costs is to buy house brands, which tend to be cheaper, the experts said.
For those who often dine out due to long working hours and may not have the time to cook, both Ms Loong and Dr Kalpana suggested opting for healthier options when ordering food. 
“Some examples include requesting for lower salt or oil, opting for whole grains, increasing vegetable consumption, reducing the amount of deep-fried food, or requesting for less gravy,” said Ms Loong. 
Dr Chong also suggested cooking several dishes in bulk over the weekend, portioning them and then freezing them, so that they can be eaten any day of the week. 
But if this is not possible, it is important to “choose very wisely” when eating out. 
“There are a lot of food options in Singapore and sometimes it can be a double-edged sword because you may be tempted to go for more delicious and higher calorie foods,"" she said. 
But there are ways to avoid these temptations such as picking a route to avoid walking past stores selling less healthy food, she added. 
Though changing one’s eating habits may seem like a Herculean task to some, for others it is a necessary step in order to live a healthier life well into their sunset years. 
Ms Tjut Rostina said: “I’m 42 and I’m already thinking about ageing gracefully. I don’t want to be susceptible to things like high blood pressure and diabetes in the years to come.”

'I see this more like a calling': The volunteers involved in a support scheme for young suspects,"Under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS), they accompany suspects during interviews with law enforcement agencies.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/appropriate-adult-scheme-young-suspects-investigations-volunteers-2993761,"SINGAPORE: His work as a volunteer in a support scheme for young suspects has taken him to various locations, but the time when he returned to his secondary school has stuck with Muhammad Ilyas Zainal Akmar until today.
“When I stepped inside, people were wondering what was this guy doing back here?” recalled Mr Ilyas, 34.
“One teacher recognised me ... the teacher was looking very weirdly at me, and I had to explain the whole scheme.”
Mr Ilyas is one of the volunteers under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS), a support scheme where an “appropriate adult” - an independently trained volunteer - accompanies young suspects during interviews with law enforcement agencies.
As of October this year, there are about 280 volunteers for the AAYS, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

Support scheme for young suspects during police interviews will soon include 16 and 17 year olds: Sun Xueling













The scheme was first piloted in 2017, before being rolled out islandwide in 2019.
It followed a multi-agency review of investigation processes for young people after the suicide of Benjamin Lim. The 14-year-old was found dead at the foot of his block after he was questioned by the police over an allegation involving outrage of modesty.
The scheme currently applies to suspects under 16, but as announced in Parliament in July, it will be expanded to cover suspects aged 16 and 17 by October next year.
Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said last year that there are regular reviews to ensure that protocols in dealing with young suspects are up to date. He spoke in Parliament in response to questions from MPs about the case of 17-year-old drug suspect Justin Lee, who fell to his death months after he was arrested and charged in court.
PASSION TO SERVE
Having previously helped with a football programme at Roundbox, one of Singapore Children Society’s youth drop-in centres, Mr Ilyas is no stranger to volunteering with minors.
“The football programme ended and they extended this opportunity to me which I found quite interesting, so I took it up. I've always had this passion to serve and it involved the youth. I really believe that our youth are our future,” he told CNA.
“There are two parts to this - one of them is ... helping out with this programme and at the same time it also gives me an understanding on why youth act a certain way and stuff like that.”
While he initially had reservations about his safety, these concerns eventually dissipated, Mr Ilyas said.
“After I took on a few cases here and there, I realised that most of these children … did what they did because of circumstances instead of them being bad people. So that gave me the assurance to continue on,” he explained.
Before becoming an “appropriate adult”, volunteers like Mr Ilyas undergo compulsory training by the Singapore Children’s Society, the service provider for the AAYS.
Volunteers must attend a compulsory briefing, followed by an AAYS volunteer training session before they can be activated. They are trained to look out for signs of distress in the young suspect, aid communication between the young suspect and investigation officer and provide emotional support when necessary.
Volunteers CNA spoke to stressed the need to be a neutral party during interviews.
“Being neutral really helps them to open up a bit. Even the simple act of just nodding along to what they say can help them be more comfortable. It definitely helps if you portray neutrality very well, then I think both parties will have a win-win situation,” said Mr Ilyas.
“We must be balanced, we must show them I’m not (taking) any side,” added Madam Irene Yeh, another volunteer. The 70-year-old was introduced to the AAYS by a friend, and has been helping out for more than two years.
“When I am there, I think they feel safer. And I always tell them I'm not a police officer. I emphasise I'm not a police officer. Of course some of the kids, they don't understand what an AA is, so I use another term like I'm a volunteer from Children's Society ... This is where I make them feel comfortable,” she added.

Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Rhadji Karim, who is an investigating officer (IO) with the Singapore Police Force, explained that these volunteers have been helpful in interviews.
""Usually, they won't interfere in my investigations or questioning - only when they see some trigger points that are exhibited from the suspect, then they will step in,"" he explained.
This can be in terms of helping paraphrase questions or helping assist in communication between both parties, Senior Staff Sergeant Rhadji said.
Their work also ensures that the IO avoids getting into any ""pitfalls"" of recording inaccurate statements, he added.
In the event that investigation officers have to conduct interviews with persons with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders or mental health issues, “appropriate adults” under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Persons with Mental Disabilities (AAPMD) have been particularly helpful, said Senior Staff Sergeant Rhadji.
“We ... acknowledge that they have limited life experience, and also limited psychological resources to actually cope with the stress of handling this situation,” he added.
“So, we will activate this AA to … explain to them that they are a neutral party, they are inside this interview to assist the suspect in case they require any emotional support and also to facilitate me in communication.”
The AAPMD scheme which encompasses suspects, victims and witnesses of all ages with mental disabilities, was started in 2015. There are currently about 329 volunteers for the AAPMD.
One of the volunteers under the scheme is retiree Benjamin Chan. He has been activated for 41 cases.
It is important that AAPMD volunteers follow the interview closely so as to better help suspects, victims and witnesses, said Mr Chan, 57.
“If you don't show your interest with the investigation, when they have a problem, they (will) also feel reluctant to check in with you,” he added.
“Even though sometimes it can be repetitive … Just follow closely, make sure not to be judgmental and let them express themselves.”
A VARIETY OF REACTIONS
Young suspects display a variety of reactions prior to and during interviews, said volunteers whom CNA spoke to.
While there are repeat offenders who are unrepentant, some minors are overwhelmed and will burst into tears, said Mdm Yeh.
“I remember in one case the boy was shivering - actually we are not supposed to touch them - but (there was) no choice, I just held on to the hand and straightaway … the shivering stopped,” she added.
Some are afraid that their parents will find out, she added.

Volunteers also have to deal with a spectrum of cases, some of which can be more serious in nature. Mdm Yeh for one, was involved as the ""appropriate adult"" in a case where a student attempted to assault a teacher with a knife.
“I had one case where it was a sexual assault case, unfortunately the IO had to get a lot of details on it. As he dug more for more details, it got a bit more disturbing … It is something that is not for the weak stomach,” added Mr Ilyas.
“I don't think it can get away from you that easily. It's something I guess varies from person to person - for me it takes a lot of video game sessions for me to forget about it … It will stick for a while.”
There are times where parents also get involved, noted Mdm Yeh. But volunteers are trained not to engage them, she pointed out.
“I have parents shouting at me. (They) ask the IO: ‘Who is she? Why is she going in when I cannot go in?’” she recalled. “Sometimes they ask: ‘Can we meet ... Can I buy you coffee?’
“I will try not to have any conversation with their parents or guardians. It’s our guidelines ... After the investigation, we have to be detached and (keep an) arm's length from (it),"" added Mr Chan.
EXPECTING THE UNEXPECTED
AAYS volunteers are notified via SMS about each potential case. The text messages contain details such as the time, date and location of the interviews.
If they would like to help out in a particular case, volunteers have to acknowledge the message within about 10 minutes. If they are matched with the case, a confirmation SMS will be sent to them shortly thereafter.
Volunteers have learnt to expect the unexpected as interviews can often drag on for hours, they explained.
“When I do something, I want to be committed. And if I get a case, I block myself for at least five hours,” said Mdm Yeh, who works as a freelancer.
“Sometimes we have to call to cancel (our plans) … Sometimes (for) work, I say I'll do it the next day. (Being a) freelancer, (if) I cannot do it today, I'll do it another day.”
These interviews can be held at locations including police stations and schools.

However, as far as possible, police will interview young suspects in a police station, away from their school or place of employment, Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said in Parliament in July.
She added that if interviews need to be done at the school or place of employment, the police will avoid drawing unnecessary attention or causing embarrassment to the young suspect by dressing in plain clothes and using unmarked vehicles.
“The cases I usually respond to are ... in the late afternoon or weekends, evenings or nights,” said Mr Ilyas. “It doesn't really affect my professional life.”
“Every case is sometimes very unique ... Sometimes (it) can be stretched to five or six hours,” added Mr Chan.
Despite the various challenges, volunteers CNA spoke to are keen to continue in their role as “appropriate adults”.
Mr Chan noted that it is important that volunteers be involved so as to assure parents and the public that there are “some level of checks and balances” in the system.
“We learn a lot from the children, how to be patient, how to deal with them,” said Mdm Yeh.
Added Mr Ilyas: “It's something that ... I have a very strong passion (for), especially when it comes to our youth. I don’t see this as a volunteering thing. I see this more like a calling, something that I should give back to society."""
Malaysia to lift export ban on live broiler chickens from Oct 11: SFA,"The Singapore Food Agency said it is seeking clarification on the details.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/malaysia-lift-export-ban-live-broiler-chickens-oct-11-singapore-food-agency-2998086,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Sunday (Oct 9) said Malaysia will lift its temporary export ban on live broiler chickens from Oct 11. 
Responding to CNA's queries, the agency said it received ""official notification"" from Malaysia's Department of Veterinary Services on the lifting of the ban.
""We welcome the resumption of live chicken broiler imports, and are seeking clarification on the details,"" said SFA. 
The Malaysian government had earlier banned the export of up to 3.6 million chickens from Jun 1 in its efforts to tackle supply and pricing issues for chicken in the country.
The ban was implemented following complaints of supply shortage and price increases of chicken, with some traders selling their poultry above the price ceiling to cover their costs.
Explaining the curbs, Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government's priority was its own people and that authorities will also investigate allegations of cartel pricing. 
FILL THE GAP
Malaysia exported poultry meat worth US$18.9 million in 2020, making it the 49th largest exporter of the product in the world.
Its main export markets are Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Brunei, according to the data platform Observatory of Economic Complexity.
Singapore imports about 34 per cent of its chicken supply from Malaysia, almost all of which is brought in as live chickens that are then slaughtered and chilled locally.
To fill the gap amid Malaysia's export ban, Singapore increased imports of chicken meat from Thailand and Indonesia. 
Malaysia's ban was partially lifted in mid-June to allow poultry importers in Singapore to resume bringing in live kampung and black chickens.

In August, Malaysia's Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Ronald Kiandee said after a period of chicken supply disruptions in the country, the situation has stabilised after steps taken by the government. 
He added that Malaysia was in an oversupply situation and could now export chickens to other countries. 
Chairman of Malaysia's task force against inflation Annuar Musa later added that some farms in Malaysia rearing chicken specifically for export may resume exporting in October after getting approval from the Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry.
“Only certain farms designated for producing chicken can start breeding now for export purposes. But they cannot reduce the existing output or import that has been allowed,” said Mr Annuar.
DIVERSIFY SUPPLY
As Singapore will continue to face disruption in its food supply from time to time due to external factors, SFA said it will continue to accredit more sources of chicken and work with the industry to diversify. 
""We encourage businesses to review their Business Continuity Plans and to diversify further. This helps the industry to spread out and reduce their risks of supply disruptions."" 
Households and individuals can also contribute to Singapore's food resilience by being flexible with food and ingredient choices, said SFA. They can also switch to alternative products or sources when necessary.

Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine same safety profile as original dose: Ong Ye Kung,"Six in 100,000 who took the original COVID-19 vaccine reported serious adverse events and all have recovered or are recovering, said the Health Minister.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moderna-spikevax-bivalent-vaccine-safety-profile-original-ong-ye-kung-2997786,"SINGAPORE: Clinical studies have shown that the updated Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine has the same safety profile as the original dose which had about six in 100,000 people reporting serious adverse events, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.
All who have reported serious adverse events after taking the vaccine have recovered or are recovering, added Mr Ong on Sunday (Oct 9).
He was responding to several questions in a Facebook post after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced the country’s updated vaccination regime on Friday. 
Among the updated recommendations, MOH said that all individuals should keep up to date with the latest guidance and ensure they “achieve minimum protection”. 
The latest vaccination recommendations are three complete mRNA or Novavax doses or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses for minimum protection.

Updated COVID-19 vaccination requirements and bivalent vaccines: Here's what you need to know



















COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months to 4 years to start from Oct 25



















All COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated measures to be lifted from Oct 10: MOH













Mr Ong clarified on Sunday that while any person who previously had an infection and two mRNA vaccine shots has minimum protection, such individuals should not consider an infection as a substitute for a vaccine dose. 
“To keep up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination, if you are 50 years old or older and have achieved minimum protection, you should receive an additional dose within five months to one year of the last vaccine dose,” he said. 
Addressing concerns surrounding the updated bivalent dose that targets the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant, Mr Ong said that clinical studies have proven that the dose has the same safety profile as the original Moderna/Spikevax mRNA vaccine.
The original vaccine has been administered more than three million times in Singapore, he noted.
“Serious adverse events have been reported in about six in 100,000 vaccinations, and all have recovered or are recovering,” Mr Ong said, adding that the Health Sciences Authority has reported a declining rate of such events with subsequent shots.
This means that fewer people have adverse reactions after taking booster doses compared to taking it as part of the primary series.
Those who are considering of skipping their second booster shot and taking the bivalent dose instead should do so, said Mr Ong. 
""We have basically stopped counting boosters,"" he added.
The Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine will be available at all joint testing and vaccination centres from Oct 17.
MODERNA/SPIKEVAX VACCINE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN
Separately, Mr Ong assured the public that it is safe to vaccine children aged six months to five years with the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, which will be available to them as a primary vaccination. 
He added that serious adverse effects are rare, with no cases of anaphylaxis or pericarditis/myocarditis observed in the clinical trial.
“Common side effects (such as injection site pain, fatigue, headache) were observed less commonly than in adults and subside within two to three days,” said the Health Minister.
Singapore will begin offering COVID-19 vaccinations for children between the ages of six months and four years starting on Oct 25, said MOH on Friday.
The recommended Moderna/Spikevax vaccine dosage for this age group is two doses of 25 micrograms each, spaced eight weeks apart.
""The vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty, which is a three-dose vaccine for children aged six months to four years, has also been approved and we are awaiting delivery. It should be available by the end of the year,"" MOH added.
The Pfizer/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is undergoing evaluation and is expected to be available by the end of this year, said the ministry. 
The Health Ministry also said in the news release that all COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated measures will be lifted from Oct 10, with restrictions no longer in place for dining in, nightlife establishments and events with more than 500 participants.

"From Moulmein-Cairnhill to Somerset, initiatives in Singapore aim to improve mental health among different age groups","Well-being circles hope to attract more Singaporeans act as “first responders” for mental health wellness in community settings like neighbourhoods and schools.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-week-well-being-circles-community-first-responders-2995921,"SINGAPORE: On the outset, the elderly who make up most of the Moulmein-Cairnhill estate appear to have many friends, stopping to catch up with long-time neighbours and waving at children.
But their actions may belie their struggles.
In the division within Tanjong Pagar GRC and stretches from Farrer Road to Serangoon Road, these seniors may not feel connected.
“Seniors are very lonely sometimes,” Ms Jessica Lum, who is one of Moulmein-Cairnhill’s Resident Committee chairwomen, told CNA. 
“So when they get together, we need them to meet face to face. They tend to share a lot and then they'll be happier.”
It is with this aim that ""well-being circles"" have been set up in the area, as part of a pilot initiative aimed at bringing people together to make sure activities and emotional help are readily available.
As part of the initiative under the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth's SG Mental Well-Being Network, is a programme called Our House Downstairs.
It is a series of arts and crafts sessions run by community partner 32cm that helps about 50 Moulmein-Cairnhill residents interact and bond over vials of neon paint at Pek Kio Community Club every Thursday.
The hope is that the initiative grows and trains more people to act as first responders for mental health in community settings like neighbourhoods and schools.
“We are thinking of getting more partners in to have more initiatives and more activities for (the residents),” said Ms Lum. “We need more training for volunteers to get them together.”
REACHING OUT TO THE YOUTH
However, it's not just the elderly who needs such support. One group has made the Somerset district its base to reach out to younger Singaporeans.
Youth Corps’ Re:ground @ Dungeon at The Red Box along Somerset Road opens its doors every Thursday, offering a cozy environment, wholesome board games, and a listening ear from peer supporters like Ms Anita Chan.
“When youths feel like they want to talk to someone about their issues, we will just sit in, we'll talk to them and just provide a listening ear and if necessary, we will direct links to relevant resources such as professional help if needed,” she said.
Sometimes, that means asking about their day. But when a little push is needed, the 27-year-old turns to question-based games like Smol Tok to get the conversation flowing.
Having struggled with change, uncertainty, and stress shortly after entering the workforce, Ms Chan was convinced of the importance of youth mental health.
She joined the Youth Corps Community Peer Supporter Programme in September 2021 to help others like her.
TARGETED PROGRAMMES PROVIDE SUPPORT
According to psychologists, such targeted programmes go a long way in providing more effective support for those struggling with mental health.
“Some coping mechanisms can actually help and I do find that these wellness circles or these mental health outreaches or these so-called first responders can be useful in managing this distress,” said Dr Kelvin Ng, a senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
“It being locale-based, it's not so stigmatising. Imagine having to come to IMH, for example, for something that is not really a big, bad mental health issue. That can be quite difficult for some people,” he added.
While Dr Ng agrees that community support could ease the strain on professional services, he is concerned that information overload or misinformation could cause some to believe they might be ill.
“When you have increased awareness, decreased stigma, reduce the obstacles to seeking help, we do see that there are some who would come in – what I term the ‘worried well’ – who are actually not having a disorder,” he said.
“They might be not even in distress, but it could be stress and they could be (thinking): ‘Oh, I watched this on TV, I read this on the Internet. Do I have this, do I have that?’""
Dr Ng said that the key is knowing the difference between distress and disorder, and with the right training, community volunteers can help make a difference in Singapore’s mental health response.
“Once the distress hits the disorder level, meaning that they have developed a mental health issue, then that would be where mental health professionals like myself would have to (step in),” he said.

"Power outage at Woodlands Checkpoint causes long queues, delays with immigration clearance",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/power-outage-woodlands-checkpoint-queues-immigration-delays-2997626,"SINGAPORE: A power outage at Woodlands Checkpoint caused issues with immigration clearance for about several hours in the early hours of Sunday (Oct 9), the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said.
In a Facebook post at 1.15am, the ICA advised travellers to enter or depart Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint instead of Woodlands.
ICA also advised motorists to check the traffic situation through the Land Transport Authority's One Motoring website.
The authority later updated at 5.30am that immigration clearance and power had been restored. 
OUTAGE DUE TO BACKUP GENERATOR FAILURE
In response to CNA's queries, ICA said the power outage was due to the failure of a backup generator during maintenance of Woodlands Checkpoint’s main power source, which was scheduled to start at around 11.40pm on Saturday. 
The timing of the maintenance was chosen ""as it had the lowest traffic volume at the checkpoint"", said an ICA spokesperson.
""The servicing required ICA to disconnect the normal source and replace components parts serving that source,” they added.
As part of the maintenance, the backup power generator was activated to provide power. However, at around 12.20am on Sunday, the backup power generator failed, resulting in a power outage that disrupted operations at the checkpoint, explained the spokesperson.
The backup power generator had been serviced and tested earlier on Saturday.
When the power outage happened, ICA said it worked with Malaysian authorities to direct inbound vehicles towards the Tuas Checkpoint, while immigration officers and Traffic Police were also deployed on BKE and Woodlands Crossing to divert affected traffic.
""For arriving vehicles and travellers who were already on the Causeway towards Woodlands Checkpoint or within the checkpoint, contingency measures were implemented to clear them without compromising security,"" said ICA. 
""To better manage arriving traffic, Old Woodlands Checkpoint was also opened and additional ICA officers were deployed there to facilitate immigration clearance.""
Power was restored at around 4am, said the spokesperson, adding that immigration clearance resumed at around 5.15am. 
Operations were back to normalcy at around 6.25am, said ICA.
ICA added that it regrets the inconvenience caused and thanked travellers for their understanding and cooperation.
 
During the power outage, some Facebook users uploaded pictures of congested lanes and long vehicular queues outside Woodlands Checkpoint under ICA's post.
One traveller commented that at 3.15am, Woodlands Checkpoint was ""super dark with only emergency lights on"".
Several motorists travelling from Malaysia to Singapore also said they experienced traffic tailback when trying to enter the checkpoint."
Swensen's hires students with special needs. It doesn't expect customers to lower service expectations,"Restaurant chain Swensen's makes it a point not to put up signs about its inclusive hiring policy to ensure all staff members are treated the same.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/swensens-hires-special-needs-staff-it-doesnt-expect-customers-lower-service-expectations-2954211,"SINGAPORE: There is nothing particularly different about the service staff at the Swensen's outlet at Clementi Mall, or any of Swensen's 25 outlets islandwide for that matter.
The restaurant chain does not put out signs about its hiring practices, nor does it make some of its staff wear nametags that differentiate them from the rest. There are hardly any mainstream or social media articles about how it hires people with special needs.
""Inclusive hiring was not a thing back then,"" Swensen's Singapore CEO Teo Tong Loong told CNA on Sep 19 of the restaurant's decision to start this policy in 2008.
""The genesis of the whole thought process is that we never wanted to treat them any different. We thought we would be able to create some positive impact by allowing them a possible career.""

Mr Teo said this aim has not changed more than a decade on, as he stressed that Swensen's does not want these employees - called customer service representatives - to be given exceptions. This also explains why there are no signs alluding to their conditions.
""The whole idea of being inclusive is that you don't discriminate ... At the end of the day, there isn't any difference in terms of the work that they're doing,"" he said.
""So I mean, if you label them, then what's the difference? You can be inclusive, but you won't be actually making a difference, in that they are still seen as different.""

Beyond employment, Mr Teo highlighted that some parents worry about their special needs children's welfare, especially after they eventually pass on.
""So we take that very seriously, and as part of that we've always been trying to create a community where they can feel supported with or without their parents,"" he added.
""The hope is that we would be able to create that very safe environment and also a career that they can continue with throughout.""
But from time to time, this policy - Swensen's offers jobs to about 20 to 40 students from special education schools each year - comes under the spotlight.
DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING LESS
On Aug 9, Facebook user Sindhu RK Johnson posted about her poor experience at the Swensen's outlet in Clementi Mall, describing how service staff did not wipe her table properly and ignored her request to redeem a free drink.
When Ms Sindhu raised her grievances with the manager, what she heard next ""broke my heart"", she said.
She was told that most of the waiters and waitresses at the outlet had special needs, adding in her post that she eventually apologised and suggested that this be somehow made known to patrons.
Ms Sindhu's post has been shared and reacted to more than 4,500 times, attracting more than 400 comments. Many praised her for being understanding, although some said she should have been kind to service staff regardless of their condition.
Others took a different perspective: ""I am not in favour of accommodating shoddy service just because of inclusion,"" one netizen wrote.

Mr Teo said Swensen's has never tried to premise its inclusive hiring policy on customers expecting less or having to deal with it.
""In the context of responding to customers, we will always take the stance that it's never the case that we are trying to use that as an excuse,"" he said.
""If you've unfortunately been a victim of our poor service, then we apologise and we hope that next time you come, we'll be able to serve you better.""
GIVING STUDENTS A JOB
Behind this mission of maintaining service standards is a rigorous training system that begins even before these students finish secondary school.
In Secondary 4, special needs students who want to get into the Workforce Skills Qualification programme at Delta Senior School will first be assessed on their academics, attendance and conduct.
Delta Senior is a post-secondary special education school under social service agency APSN that takes in students with mild intellectual disabilities.
It counts Swensen's as one of its 150 active employment partners across four vocational sectors: Food and beverage, horticulture, retail, as well as hotel and accommodation services.

After admission, students go through four years of education, comprising vocational skills training in school in years 1 and 2.
Year 3 will be a mix of on-the-job training, remedial lessons in school, and finally a five-day week work attachment. 
Students spend their fourth year working six days a week for a company, which can offer them employment at any time.
""At every phase, there are a lot of assessments,"" Delta Senior School principal Subash Lazar said, pointing to a potential ""chopping and changing"" of jobs for students. 





      How special needs students get hired
  

To qualify for Delta Senior School's Workforce Skills Qualification programme, Secondary 4 students need to show baseline levels of literacy and numeracy. They must also have been present for 95 per cent of classes as a benchmark for attendance in future employment.
""Students must meet prescribed eligibility criteria for admission as we want to ensure that students are able to manage the demands of the programme,"" said school principal Subash Lazar.
Eligible students will then go through a four-hour vocational profiling exercise to determine their abilities in the four sectors and be assigned to one of them. Delta Senior School staff will speak to parents and consider the students' interests and preferences.
""What we're looking out for is not their raw competencies, but their affinity for the different types of tasks in the various industries,"" Mr Subash said, adding that students are asked to complete generic tasks in different stations to assess things like balance, agility, strength and fine motor skills.
In the first two years of the programme, students will take core subjects like literacy and numeracy as well as physical and character education. They will also go through vocational courses in school to be certified in a specific job for their assigned sector.
During this period, vocational trainers and job coaches will assess students on their work readiness before mapping them to a company.
""Here, there's no pressure because it's all in-house. They are taught everything, they can make all kinds of mistakes. They're not out there in the authentic stations,"" Mr Subash said.
Still, he stressed that the training will include a ""sense of realism"" to ensure students build towards competencies for actual jobs.
""We must be nice, caring and supporting but we cannot be overly caring and nice until we render them incompetent for the real world,"" he said.
""So if there are safety violations during training, we will not hesitate to remind them in a very stern manner that this must not happen in the worksite.""
Vocational trainers will also give feedback to job coaches and identify students who need more support. These students will likely be assigned to back-end roles doing more routine tasks to ensure they are set up for success, Mr Subash said.
Front-facing customer service jobs involve a lot of ""ambiguity"", he explained, noting that food orders are unlikely to be simple and include requests like less sugar or more sauce. This could be challenging for special needs staff, who thrive on set routines and instructions.
In the first semester of the third year, students will undergo two days of training at the workplace - supervised by vocational trainers - and three days of training in school. Trainers will observe gaps in students' skills and brush up on them when they return to school.
The second semester will see students spend the full five-day week at the workplace and earn an allowance of around S$500 a month. Job coaches will drop by around once a week to check on their progress and whether they need more support.
""If the fella is coping well, I fade out. If the person is struggling and needs more support, I stay longer,"" Mr Subash said.
""This fading in and out is critical because once they are employed, there is no hand-holding. The system is such that you cannot be hand-holding them forever because you must let them realise that they can be independent.""
In the fourth year, students will be attached to a company and work six days a week without supervision from the school, earning about S$720 a month.
This is when the employer can offer students a job at any point during the year, with a monthly salary of between S$1,500 and close to S$2,000, Mr Subash said. Those who do not get an offer throughout the year will go into a fifth year of work attachment.

Students who face a lot of challenges, including poor employer feedback, could be transferred to a slower-paced role in a different company.
""If the pace and intensity of the restaurant is very fast, and the employer also tries to make accommodations but the student is still struggling, we have to make a judgment call,"" he said.
""So let's say when it comes to hotel accommodation services, five-star hotels and all are not going to reduce their pace for my student.""
One challenge that special needs students face, Mr Subash said, is the ability to transfer their skills to an unfamiliar environment surrounded by strangers.
""In school, the student is able to carry a pitcher of water and pour it smoothly into the glasses. No anxiety because the trainer is watching, a familiar figure,"" he added.
""You bring him to an F&B outlet, who is standing beside him? Supervisor - unfamiliar. Hands start shivering, the execution of the task is not as smooth.""
DEALING WITH UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS
Back in the Swensen's outlet at Clementi Mall, there were not many customers. CNA observed a mix of four special needs staff members and neurotypical colleagues working the floor that day.
The staff occasionally asked their colleagues for help, but they worked largely independently to serve food, take customer requests and clean tables. Orders were done on an iPad.
While Swensen's employs special needs staff at all its outlets, there is no fixed percentage mix as this depends on each outlet's duty roster and staff schedules. The larger outlet in Clementi Mall is used for training, so most of the waiters and waitresses there have special needs.

One of them is Delta Senior School graduate Diana Goh, who was wiping a table clean. A customer at another table asked for more sauce, so she went to the back and brought out some.
""My experience has been fun, I think, because I get to interact with customers and see what they need,"" said the 23-year-old, who has been at the restaurant for slightly more than a month. Depending on the roster, she works five hours a day most days of the week.
Ms Goh said she has encountered customers who got angry and shouted at her. When asked to describe the incident, she said they were ""not happy"".
""When we cannot handle the situation, we will ask the manager for help,"" she said.

Ms Goh said she does not feel that customers treat her differently, adding that she prefers to be treated the same way anyway.
She initially had difficulties answering a question on how she maintained service standards at the restaurant, but with the encouragement of her job coach, who accompanied her during the interview, she said she greets customers when they enter and serves them water and cutlery.
""I enjoy working in the F&B industry because it is interesting and there are a lot of things to learn,"" she said, adding that she foresees staying in the sector for some time. ""It helps me to improve in whatever I do ... to help people.""
MAINTAINING SERVICE STANDARDS
Mr Teo, the Swensen's CEO, said jobs for special needs staff are scoped to their abilities. For instance, they are asked to tend to a certain number of tables first before moving on to more tables if they show they can handle it.
""To be fair, the approach for training is not too different from normal staff. The key difference would be the amount of time,"" he said, adding that some special needs staff will need more training on their communication skills.
""We spend a little bit more attention on their training, allowing the individual a little bit more leeway with regard to mastering certain tasks before moving on. Expectations are managed a little bit softer just because you want to be able to understand the individual.""

This ""scoping"" allows Swensen's to try and maintain service standards, he said, although he pointed out that neurotypical but introverted staff might have trouble communicating with customers too.
""There are a lot of challenges, but I won't go as far to say the challenges are a lot more because they are intellectually disabled,"" he said.
""I don't think there is that much more of an issue in terms of management, and I will go a bit further as to say some of our staff from these placement programmes are a lot more effective and more efficient in certain areas.
""An example would be ... there is no distraction from phones on the go. That is something that I would think any employer would be very happy about.""

If customers have complaints about service standards, Mr Teo said restaurant managers can decide if they want to let customers know about the nature of their staff.
""More often than not, we don't just go to every single unhappy customer and tell them it's because this person (has a condition),"" he said.
""We don't want to because at the end of the day, we want to treat everyone the same. So, there is no special treatment when it comes to showcasing it or using it as an excuse for a lack of a better description.""
DEVELOPING JOB SKILLS
Regardless, the special needs staff have shown they can improve in the areas that are lacking.
Delta Senior School job coach Goh Wei Tin said students might face challenges in seemingly simple tasks, like counting the number of customers at a table or matching orders to table numbers.
Ms Diana Goh, for example, used to work in a retail job but had difficulties in an environment that required a lot of customer interaction.
""She had a soft skills issue but now she has the composure when interacting with customers,"" said Ms Goh Wei Tin, who is also in charge of the school's employer relations.
""She gets a little bit impatient sometimes, but now she knows what are the social norms, steps back a bit and adapts to the work and social environment.""

Another special needs staff member at Swensen's in Clementi Mall, Albert Wong, started working in a back-end role before taking a few years to improve his communication skills and switch to a customer-facing job bussing tables.
""My experience has been great, but I still need to improve my skills, learn more things to help the company to grow,"" said the 27-year-old who has been at Swensen's for six years.
Mr Wong said he has had some bad experiences with customers, highlighting his difficulties interacting with them and reacting to their requests.

But he insisted that talking back to customers is a no-no, adding that he will apologise to them and ask the manager for help.
Mr Wong said he feels comfortable trusting his colleagues and seeing them every day. ""If I have any problem, I will talk to them and they can help me,"" he said.
""VERY REWARDING FOR US""
Mr Subash said special needs students who have gone through his school's programme will be supported by alumni throughout the rest of their career.
For instance, a middle-aged former student who dropped out of his current job because he could not handle it can ask a fellow alumnus for help in finding a new one.
""Because every year, we are mapping out students to our partners. We can easily map a 40-year-old into one of our existing partners,"" Mr Subash said.
""Sometimes when we're supporting our current students, employment partners also do ask us if we have any ready-made employees.""
Mr Subash is heartened to see parents of special needs children ""jump for joy"" when they see their kids getting jobs, saying that some of these parents were particularly anxious about whether their children could get employment.
""So, it's very rewarding for us when we uplift the children and the families.""

Mr Teo believes that the hiring programme at Swensen's has achieved its aim of creating a safe community for those with special needs, although he downplayed any notions of success.
""I'm happy to say that we have some of these staff who have stayed on for a very long time, and the hope is that we can continue to keep doing this and facilitate this community to continue to grow,"" he said.
Ultimately, he said the main objective for Swensen's is to ensure that customers ""can't tell the difference"" between their staff members.
""That will be our greatest achievement, (when) we've been able to assimilate someone who didn't seem like he could get equal opportunity."""
CPTPP welcomes Malaysia as trade bloc commits to supporting global recovery,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/comprehensive-progressive-agreement-trans-pacific-partnership-cptpp-commission-malaysia-welcomed-2996776,"SINGAPORE: Malaysia was welcomed as a party to the 11-nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on Saturday (Oct 8).
Following a meeting of the CPTPP commission, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong announced that Malaysia had completed its official ratification process of the CPTPP free trade agreement.
""Malaysia’s addition as a party to the CPTPP will further deepen economic integration, boost the economic coverage of the agreement and enhance the mutual benefits that parties reap from the CPTPP,"" said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a statement.
The CPTPP will enter into force for Malaysia on Nov 29, leaving Brunei and Chile as the only countries yet to ratify the trade pact.
Malaysia's Senior Minister and Minister of International Trade and Industry Mohamed Azmin Ali said in a Facebook post on Saturday that CPTPP members have demonstrated ""firm solidarity, fraternity and shared ideals"" towards the meaningful adoption of a rules-based multilateral trading system.
""Moving forward, Malaysia will continue to work together to engage with all members in implementing and enhancing the partnership,"" said Mr Azmin Ali.
Singapore is the 2022 chair of the CPTPP commission and Mr Gan chaired its sixth meeting on Saturday.
Ministers and senior officials representing New Zealand, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam attended the meeting, which marked the first time representatives of all CPTPP members met in person since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CPTPP is the successor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which pulled together 12 nations around the Pacific rim, including Singapore and the United States, to draw up a more ambitious set of trading rules.
The TPP died in January 2017 when the Donald Trump administration in the US withdrew from the agreement despite it already being signed. The 11 remaining nations decided to continue as the CPTPP. 
Economies like China, Taiwan and South Korea have since shown interest in joining the pact.
UK ACCESSION PROCESS
In an update on the expansion of the CPTPP to other economies, Mr Gan said that discussions on the United Kingdom's (UK) accession is ongoing.
""As this is the first accession by an aspirant economy, it is important that we do it well and put in place the right processes, so as to uphold the CPTPP’s high standard rules and ambition, in terms of market access commitments,"" he said.
In January last year, the UK announced plans to formally apply to join the CPTPP.
Representatives of CPTPP members also acknowledged in a joint statement all efforts made to ensure the UK's compliance with the obligations of the agreement.
""We note the growing interest from aspirant economies to accede to the CPTPP. In support of the agreement’s open architecture, we will reflect on the ongoing accession process with the United Kingdom and continue to exchange views on the CPTPP’s expansion,"" said the statement.
""We will also continue efforts to address subsequent applications in accordance with the CPTPP accession process and inform ourselves on whether aspirant economies can meet the CPTPP’s high standards, taking into account their experience on their trade commitments.""
STUDYING CPTPP IMPACT
In conjunction with the CPTPP’s third year of entry into force, Mr Gan said research institutions based in the CPTPP region have assessed the impact of the agreement on trade and investment flows in the region.
Initial findings showed that intra-CPTPP trade increased by more than 4 per cent to US$467 billion in the first year into CPTPP, compared with an average of US$448 billion for the 2010-2018 period.
Intra-CPTPP digital services trade increased by 46 per cent to US$51.9 billion in 2019, compared to an average of US$35.5 billion for the 2010-2018 period.
Foreign direct investment inflows also increased by 10 per cent from US$267 billion in 2018 to US$294 billion in 2019.
""Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), employment of women and indigenous populations benefited from growth as well, and cross-border R&D activities amongst CPTPP parties were rich and interconnected,"" said Mr Gan.
The CPTPP’s impact on regional supply chains will also be assessed.
""Members are now studying these data, and will continue discussions on how the findings can translate to policy outcomes that enhance the CPTPP’s relevance and benefits to businesses and supply chains,"" Mr Gan said.
SUPPORTING GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY
The minister added on Saturday that CPTPP members will continue to explore new and emerging areas of cooperation in the digital and green economies.
In its joint statement, the CPTPP commission also reaffirmed its commitment to explore ""concrete ways to foster an enabling environment for trade and investment flows"".
This comes amid lowered forecasts for global growth by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Members also highlighted the importance of preserving economic security and to cooperate to counter protectionism and unjustified trade restrictive measures.
""We reaffirm our strong commitment to upholding and supporting the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core, including as a means for responding to economic coercion,"" they added.
""We remain resolute in our continued commitment to facilitate the flow of essential goods and services in a manner consistent with and supportive of international trade rules.
""More than ever, we must ensure that trade works for all, including women, indigenous peoples and small and medium-sized enterprises.""
The next CPTPP commission meeting will be hosted by New Zealand in 2023."
Two more Mie Sedaap instant noodle flavours recalled due to presence of pesticide,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mie-sedaap-instant-noodles-soto-curry-additional-recall-pesticide-2996736,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Saturday (Oct 8) extended a recall of Mie Sedaap instant noodles from Indonesia after detecting a pesticide in two additional products under the brand.
Due to the presence of ethylene oxide, a pesticide also found in two other flavours in an earlier recall on Thursday, SFA has directed Arklife Distributors to recall Mie Sedaap Soto instant noodles and Mie Sedaap Curry instant noodles.
The ongoing recall affects the Mie Sedaap Soto range with an expiry of Dec 11, 2022, and the Mie Sedaap Curry range expiring on Feb 22, 2023. Both originate from Indonesia.

""Those who have consumed the implicated products and have concerns about their health should seek medical advice. Consumers may contact their point of purchase for enquiries."""
Elderly self-harm a growing concern; SOS sees slight increase in crisis calls over past year,"Observers believe that self-harm among the elderly is being under-reported. Ahead of Mental Health Day on Oct 10, CNA looks at recent developments.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/seniors-self-harm-under-reported-2994311,"SINGAPORE: Almost every night, as he lay on his bed hoping to fall asleep, he would struggle with thoughts of dying alone in his one-bedroom flat.
Attempts to ignore the disturbing noise in his head were futile, recalled 69-year-old Mr Wong (not his real name). A prescription of one-and-a-half sleeping pills daily did not work. Neither did taking three pills at once, or even six.
It was a daily tussle for weeks, until one night when Mr Wong decided to take all the pills he had. He counted some 50 tablets and swallowed them.
“That time I thought, this is painless, swallow them and have a good sleep. Don’t wake up already,” the senior said in Mandarin, as he remembered that night almost five years ago. 
“But I couldn’t sleep. Instead, I felt nauseous and kept vomiting.”
Mr Wong’s case is not uncommon, said social workers from non-profit organisation O’Joy. They see about a hundred other clients with mental health issues, some of whom turn to self-harm.
Although agencies, including the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), were unable to provide figures on elderly self-harm, experts believe such cases could be under-reported.
REASONS BEHIND SELF-HARM
Self-harm, by definition, is injuring oneself on purpose but not with the intent of committing suicide, said Dr Yao Fengyuan, senior consultant and chief of the Geriatric Psychiatry Department at IMH.
The main reasons behind of elderly self-harm, according to Dr Yao, include serious physical health issues, financial difficulties and coping with loss. Then, there are those who have to deal with social isolation and family tensions during the pandemic, he added.
Elderly self-harm cases are noticeably different from those reported by youth, an age group which has received increasing attention in recent years on the issue, he said.
According to Dr Yao, seniors tend to self-harm by overdosing on medication and cutting themselves.
“There are some seniors with mental illness but are unwilling to seek help. Because these mental illnesses are associated with poor awareness, such as psychosis and dementia,” said Dr Yao.
Also, some seniors may not be able to identify their psychosomatic symptoms.
Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) chief operating officer Phua Chun Yat said: “They are likely to tell the health professionals that they are experiencing chest pains but actually it’s psychological pain.”

IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC
More seniors are seeking help for mental health issues, going by figures from the SOS. The suicide prevention agency, which offers a 24-hour hotline for emotional support, received 6 per cent more calls from those aged 60 years old and above over the past year.
During the pandemic, seniors would call in to share their struggles grappling with the uncertainty, said Mr Phua. 
“A lot of them also experienced social struggles, as they are isolated and unable to meet up with loved ones. There's a general sense of loneliness,” he said.
The struggles, however, proved to be too much for some who ended up taking their lives.
For Ms Tricia Lee, head of communications at Caregivers Alliance, the suicide of her 92-year-old grandmother during the pandemic came as “an absolute shock”.
“She moved to Singapore from Malaysia just before COVID-19 hit, so it was a tough period of adjustment for her. She didn’t have her network of long-time neighbours and friends, and we were not able to bring her out much,” said Ms Lee.
“Although we knew she was unhappy, none of us saw it coming. It took me several months to fully process that she was gone.”
SEEKING HELP
When elderly self-harm was brought up in Parliament in July this year, MOH said elderly care recipients who exhibit self-harm or aggressive behaviours can call the IMH helpline for help. Community intervention teams have also been set up to offer further care.
But these seniors may not get the assistance that they need, as more resources are moved online, experts said. 
“For those elderly who are not IT savvy, they are not used to videoconferencing. They actually prefer physical contact,” Dr Yao said.
Ms Jocelyn Toh, a senior social worker at AMKFSC Community Services’ COMNET Senior Service, shared the same view.
“Many older persons experience difficulties in keeping up with societies and struggle to use basic functions like Internet banking or using search engines,” she said.
Tell-tale signs are often less visible when dealing with seniors, she added. “Hence, it is important for us to observe carefully by listening closely to what they say and keeping track of their actions and emotions.”

"Burnout, not COVID-19 restrictions, most affected mental health in Singapore during the pandemic","Singapore’s conflict-avoidant culture at work and the unique challenges facing zoomers and millennials worsened burnout during the pandemic, experts say. CNA looks into the issue ahead of World Mental Health Day on Oct 10.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/burnout-mental-health-workers-employees-pandemic-2972961,"SINGAPORE: In the middle of last year, Jovena Loon found herself dreading going to sleep at night, having difficulty breathing and feeling a lump in her throat and stomach “all the time”.
“I remember sometimes resting on my bed at night, thinking: ‘Why am I here to suffer?’” the 31-year-old told CNA.
Ms Loon, who works in innovation for a multinational corporation in the food and beverage industry, started feeling this way after a trying stretch in her career and personal life.
She had been double hatting at work for half a year before taking on a new portfolio. Then followed health crises involving two older family members, for whom she was the main caregiver.
Ms Loon’s negative feelings started surfacing at the end of that period, when the situation at work and at home stabilised and she had time to rest.
“It became apparent to me that my life was kind of not under my control. That I didn’t have any sense of freedom, prioritisation of myself. I was just fulfilling the needs of everyone – my family, my work – and I felt like I wasn’t anybody.”
She continued feeling this way for about three to four months, before deciding to talk to her manager about taking a break from work in September last year.
Looking back, Ms Loon recognises that what she was going through at the time was burnout. Her struggle mirrors the experiences of many in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a survey of mental health across six Asian societies during the pandemic, commissioned by CNA, Singapore was the only place where burnout was the leading factor affecting mental health during the pandemic, chosen by 57 per cent of respondents.
This bucked the trend seen in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, where most people pointed to public measures to keep the pandemic under control, such as restrictions on mask-wearing and travel.
The results also contrasted with those from Malaysia and Indonesia, where respondents said the financial burden from loss of income most affected mental health.

PANDEMIC BLUES
As Singapore cycled through waves of infection and lockdown in the pandemic, Ms Loon developed a sense of uncertainty and of “not having a bright future”.
The inability to travel left her feeling a lack of freedom. She was also working harder during what was a disruptive time for her industry.
She developed an unhealthy lifestyle working from home, often waking up just in time for work, continuing into overtime and ending the day too tired to do anything else.
“A few months into the process, it definitely made me feel I was more like a robot than a human,” she said.
Burnout is a syndrome that results from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
It classifies burnout as an occupational phenomenon – not a medical condition – characterised by exhaustion, growing mental distance from one’s job and negative or cynical feelings towards it, and lower efficacy at work.
“The hallmark of burnout is feelings of negativity, which can include dread, anxiety, irritability and resentment. The individual may be less productive and even withdrawn, both at work and in personal life,” said Dr Zheng Zhimin, consultant psychiatrist at Nobel Psychological Wellness Clinic.
Whereas stress tends to come on quickly and dissipate once the stressor is gone, symptoms of burnout typically persist for at least one to three months, mental health professionals told CNA.
“If stress is the sense of drowning in responsibility, then burnout is the sense of being all dried up,” said Mr Chirag Agarwal, co-founder of counselling service Talk Your Heart Out.
CNA has previously reported on how work-from-home requirements during the pandemic contributed to longer work hours and blurred work-life boundaries.

“The stress of reduced personal space and options for leisure inevitably reduces life to just work or school within the confines of our home environments,” said Dr Zheng, who observed that a lack of work-life balance and social isolation caused more of her patients to experience burnout during the pandemic.
COVID-19 restrictions hurt people’s ability to take “micro steps” to manage stress, such as meeting friends and working out at the gym, and made “macro steps” like travelling harder too, said psychologist Muhammad Haikal Jamil of ImPossible Psychological Services.
The pandemic’s economic impact also made workers more vulnerable to burnout, although this could develop along two very different trajectories.
On the one hand were high performers from industries that were in demand during the pandemic, who pushed themselves to make the most of this time by doing more.
“A lot of these high performers viewed these past two years as a chance to capitalise. It’s like ... ‘It’s booming now, I better work harder,’” said Ms Crystal Lim-Lange, co-founder of leadership consultancy Forest Wolf.
On the other hand were people for whom business was going badly, and for whom the pandemic was a stressful and demoralising time, she said.
These developments meant that generally, more people sought mental health support during the pandemic, those working in the industry told CNA.
WHY SINGAPORE?
But outside the pandemic, is there something about how people live, work and play in Singapore that makes workers here more susceptible to burnout?
“We are the nation that sleeps the least in the entire world,” said Ms Lim-Lange, adding that sleep is intricately linked to mental health and resilience.
Singapore regularly features in global rankings of the most sleep-deprived cities, and last year topped a list of “fatigued cities” compiled by a UK bedding manufacturer.
Workers in Singapore sleep less, have poorer focus and are more distracted in part because of high Internet and mobile phone usage, said Ms Lim-Lange.
They tend to be bad at maintaining digital boundaries and asserting work-life boundaries, she added. At the same time, they are prone to avoiding conflict.
“People don’t know how to have difficult conversations and that is behind a lot of the burnout,” said Ms Lim-Lange.
“Singaporeans are so notoriously conflict-avoidant that they would just rather quietly look around for another job and resign ... than have that painful discussion with a boss (to say): ‘Hey, actually I’m struggling, I need a little bit more support from you.’”
“We see a lot of people not voicing out that they’re struggling, and then that doesn’t give the manager an opportunity to change anything,” said Dr Greg Lim-Lange, psychologist and co-founder at Forest Wolf.
“So step number one is that the employee really has responsibility to voice out when they’re overwhelmed, when something isn’t working out, and hopefully that can lead to some discussion around what can be changed.”
Another factor is that Singapore usually houses satellite or regional headquarters, meaning that many employees work late at night to match the business hours of global headquarters in other time zones, said Ms Lim-Lange.
ZOOMERS AND MILLENNIALS
Burnout was the top cause of deteriorating mental health chosen by survey respondents in Singapore between the ages of 18 and 39, which spans zoomers and millennials.
Those in their 40s chose burnout and the financial burden from loss of income as equally responsible for worse mental health, while people in their 50s and above pointed to COVID-19 restrictions and constrained social interactions instead.

People in 20s and 40s feel mental health declined due to pandemic, elderly report feeling better: IPS study













“Zoomers” – members of Gen Z born in the late 1990s to early 2000s – as well as millennials are particularly susceptible to burnout because of the stages of life they are at professionally and personally, experts told CNA.
People in their early 20s are just entering the workforce, trying to find their identity in the workplace and usually have more people to answer to at work given their junior positions, said Mr Haikal.
Key to understanding the psyche of Gen Z workers is the “hedonic gap”, the psychological theory that “happiness is your expectation minus your reality”, said Ms Lim-Lange.
Compared to older generations, whose expectations were surpassed by the reality of Singapore’s economic progress, zoomers have “sky-high” expectations that are not being met, she said.
Dr Zheng said that younger people have found it more challenging to remain hopeful about their future, and cite global events such as recession and inflation as factors for their negative views.
“They may find that it is not meaningful to pursue the typical dream of career success and marriage as compared to their parents, and this may result in feelings of negativity towards work itself.”
She added that some of her younger patients were adopting the “tang ping” (lying flat) lifestyle to fight burnout, choosing a “low-desire life” over “societal pressures to join the rat race where overworking is regarded as a virtue”.
“(This) can be quite worrying for their parents who feel that they are not trying hard enough,” she said.

As for millennials in their 30s, many have reached middle management and find themselves sandwiched between bosses and subordinates, said Ms Lim-Lange.
Middle managers are still trying to prove they can move up in the company, whereas those in their 40s and older have achieved more stability in their careers, said Mr Haikal.
Millennials are also more likely to be sandwiched between the demands of elderly parents and young children at home, said family physician Dr Mark Yap, who has a special interest in mental health.
“A PLASTER ON A BULLET WOUND”
Most survey respondents thought that mental health awareness in Singapore was improving, though they remained concerned about the stigma surrounding it.
A majority in Singapore – 60 per cent – also said they wanted to see more workplace health and wellness initiatives, as compared to other public services like psychiatric, sociological or therapist services.
But mental health professionals CNA spoke to painted a mixed picture of employers’ understanding of employee burnout.
Ms Lim-Lange described some companies’ responses as “very superficial, like a plaster on a bullet wound” – sponsoring a yoga class or team lunch instead of resolving systemic issues, for instance.
“The biggest predictor of burnout is actually toxic behaviour at work,” she said. This affects employees’ sense of psychological safety, or the feeling that it is safe to ask for help, take risks and say no, and that there is fairness, inclusion and diversity in the workplace.
But some companies are reluctant to even talk about burnout in such terms. “I feel there’s this reluctance to just call a spade a spade and be transparent about the challenges you’re going through,” she said.

'A necessary investment': Why firms choose to cover employees for mental health services













Mr Agarwal said that since Talk Your Heart Out launched in 2020, about 90 per cent of the companies that have approached it for employee assistance programmes were doing so for the first time.
But there needs to be a mindset shift from “risk mitigation”, such as intervening only when an employee is about to leave the company, to treating mental health support as a way to help workers thrive, he said.
He also emphasised the importance of getting a company’s top leadership to visibly endorse mental health support schemes, and to communicate about why the schemes are in place.
“You can’t just provide the voucher, the lunch. You must also explain that we care, it matters to us and that you should do it and we encourage you to do it,” he said, adding that in his experience, this boosts take-up rates.
Another positive development he has noticed: When companies do make counselling services available, this tends to have a “downstream effect” of opening up the conversation on mental health in the workplace itself.
“A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE”
Ultimately, many of those who suffer burnout will also have to turn inwards to confront certain aspects of their personalities.
The people who are most likely to develop burnout tend to have traits like emotional detachment and perfectionism, said psychologist Mr Haikal.
Ms Lim-Lange pointed to the “PERMA” model from positive psychology – developed by Dr Martin Seligman – that identifies positive emotions, engagement or “flow” at work, relationships, meaning and accomplishment as the factors that predict whether an individual is more likely to thrive or suffer burnout.
Dr Zheng’s advice is to practise self-care in an “attuned and habitual” way. “This means taking care of yourself in small ways throughout the day and being mindful of your needs,” she said.
“Rather than allowing ourselves to indulge only after a long day of hard work, when we are more likely to indulge excessively, it makes more sense to engage in self-care periodically to feel more ‘balanced’.”
For Ms Loon, burnout sparked off a period of introspection and the realisation that she lacked a “personal compass in life”.
She decided to change some habits, and started to keep a morning routine and read self-help books. Early this year, she also took a three-month sabbatical from work. She spent the time in Singapore challenging herself to explore personal interests and saying yes to trying new things.
This led to her trying forest bathing – a mindfulness practice that involves connecting with nature – for the first time. She trained to become a forest therapy guide during her break, and now leads others in forest bathing on the weekends.
“It fills me up and then I can start, I can do my work,” she said. “Even though work can never always be fully aligned with your personal purpose, but at least I feel like I’m in a good balance of what I can do outside of work that fills me.”
At the end of the three months, she felt excited to go back to work at the same company, where she remains.
“I realised that while I was going through all that turbulence and having the external factors sucking me into a space that was very negative, I didn’t – at that time – have the tools to get myself out,” she said.
“I now am clearer about who I am as a person, have found my own personal meaning in life. When I came back to the same place, I had a totally different perspective of it.”

"Singapore doesn't take sides, but has its own view and chooses 'principles': Teo Chee Hean","Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean added that Singapore has tried to do this consistently, regardless of issue.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-doesnt-take-sides-own-view-principles-teo-chee-hean-2994821,"SINGAPORE: While Singapore does not take sides in its dealings, it has its own view and chooses ""principles"" said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Friday (Oct 7).
Speaking during a fireside chat during FutureChina Global Forum, Mr Teo said that in doing so, Singapore becomes ""consistent"" and ""reliable"".
""We have said that we don't choose sides. But people sometimes misunderstand that by not choosing sides, we don't have a view. That's not true, we have a view, we choose principles ... On any particular issue, we choose principles,"" explained Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.
""The Russia-Ukraine war is one example where we acted on principle, not because we chose one side or another side. And sometimes when we choose a principle, and we act in that way, people get annoyed with us, or people praise us because they think that we either against them, or we are their best buds. But neither is true in the case of Singapore, it is because we choose principles.""
Mr Teo noted that Singapore has tried to do this consistently, regardless of issue.
COMING TO A ""LANDING POINT""
During the hour-long session, Mr Teo also touched on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
He pointed out that there has ""not been enough thinking"" beyond the tactical issues of how the war is fought. 
""There's a need to think about what the configuration will be like in Europe, with Russia, and in the world, at the end of the war ... and of course, what are the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people? If we start to think about that a little bit more ... I think we will be able to better find a way of coming to a landing point in the war,"" he said.
""I think there needs to be a little bit more strategic thinking about where we want to be. And then when we have a little bit more conceptual ideas of where one would want to see Europe, Ukraine's place in Europe, Russia's place in Europe, then it will be clearer to see where a landing point will be.""
At the same time, Mr Teo said he was ""surprised"" by the Ukrainians' ability to halt the Russian advance and credited the Ukrainian people for their ""fighting spirit"".
However, he pointed out that there was a period of 10 to 15 years where Russia under-invested or did not invest. As a result, the quality of their equipment, training, as well as mass of their armed forces declined.
""But I would say that in the last half a dozen years at least, maybe a little bit more, they've invested more in the armed forces, developed new weapons, upgraded their weapons. But in any armed forces, particularly one of that size, you can have a relatively sharp top of the pyramid and it will be quite good and quite effective,"" he added.
""But when you start to employ a much larger proportion of the armed forces, then you get into that part of the armed forces ... which may not have had the same level of re-equipping, training and leadership as the sharp end.""

Singapore says Russia's annexation of 4 Ukrainian regions violates international law













Mr Teo pointed out that Singapore took a ""firm position"" when it came to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
""Ukraine is recognised as an independent country by the members of the United Nations (UN). It's a member of the UN and all the principles with regard to the UN Charter apply to Ukraine, its sanctity of its borders, territorial integrity, non-use of force and so on. So that is the structure of the problem between Russia and Ukraine. And that's the reason why Singapore took a firm position, because Singapore's position is that sovereignty and territorial integrity is fundamental,"" he said.
""And we don't subscribe to the idea that historical mistakes and crazy decisions in the past can be used as a reason for armed action today. So we don't accept that and that's why we took a firm position in the UNGA (UN General Assembly), and we have applied very specific and targeted sanctions, but we haven't applied broad-based sanctions in the way that several other countries have done.""
However, he noted that things are different when it comes to Taiwan.
""UN member countries recognise China as a member of the UN and that Taiwan is a part of China. And that, I think has been a settled position in the UN for many, many years since 1971 when China took the seat, when the government sitting in Beijing, the People's Republic of China took the seat of China at the UN,"" he explained.
""It's a completely different structural issue than between Russia and Ukraine, which is an independent country. So I think it is important for leaders in the world to recognise that, and the vast majority of countries in the world have a One China policy, there may be about a dozen who recognise Taiwan.""
Speaking on US-China relations, Mr Teo said it was his belief that both sides would want to avoid a war.
While ""current atmospherics"" are ""not at all positive"", he said that there are some positive signs.
""Both sides have indicated that the two presidents may meet, I think that's positive. We had some positive signs earlier in Singapore - (US Defence) Secretary Lloyd Austin and (Defence) Minister Wei Fenghe met in Singapore, they talked. I think it is important to engage, to understand what each other's core concerns are and then to try and see how one can avoid arriving at a situation where you sort of walked into a war which neither side I believe wants today.""
""ABILITY AND CAPABILITY""
Mr Teo, who is 67, also discussed Singapore's 4G leadership, praising them for noting that they are ""up to the task"".
""I have worked with my younger colleagues ... for many years, and I've watched them in close range what they do, how they make decisions and so on ... And I can see the qualities that they have,"" he said.

""The most important quality is that your heart is in the right place. If you want to be in public service, your happiness comes from other people's happiness, your satisfaction comes from seeing other people satisfied and happy. That's the essence of the right person, the essence of the person being in public service. And I can see that my colleagues have their hearts in the right place and that's what they want to do.""
At the same time, he noted that they also have the ""ability and the capability"". 
""(The) COVID (pandemic) I think is a very good example where you're thrown into a crisis, you have to make decisions, difficult decisions in the face of uncertainty. You have to explain that to a public which is frightened, confused and wanting guidance and leadership. And I think they have succeeded in doing that, quite well. And if you ask me, they are up to the task,"" he added.
Mr Teo added that the secret to stability and continuity comes from making sure that you have a good succession plan.
""That was the wisdom of Mr Lee (Kuan Yew). He was always looking and looking and looking for the new generation, for good people that will come up, come forward, serve, with a heart for the country ... And so, we learn from that and we try and do that,"" he added.
""For myself, whether I'm in Government, not in Government, it matters less to me. I know where my heart is, and I know that I am committed to serving Singapore and Singaporeans, and I will continue to do so regardless of where I am or what position I'm holding for the future."""
Updated COVID-19 vaccination requirements and bivalent vaccines: Here's what you need to know,"The Ministry of Health has issued new guidelines on how to determine if a COVID-19 vaccination is ""up-to-date"". 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-bivalent-moderna-spikevax-pfizer-sinovac-2994886,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Oct 7) announced that Singapore will transit from tracking the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses taken to an ""up-to-date vaccination"" definition regime.
Under the updated arrangement, MOH said everyone should keep up to date with the latest vaccination recommendations, such as three complete mRNA or Novavax doses or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses for minimum protection.
Those aged 50 and above should also receive an additional booster dose between five months to one year from their last dose, to keep up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination, said MOH.
Besides the updated vaccination regime, the original Moderna/Spikevax vaccines will be replaced with the updated bivalent version.
Here is what you need to know about the updated recommendations: 
MINIMUM PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19
Under the updated vaccination arrangement, MOH said all individuals should keep up to date with the latest recommendations and ensure they ""achieve minimum protection"". 
To achieve minimum protection against COVID-19, those aged five and above should complete three mRNA or Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine doses, or four doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine. 
Individuals will be considered up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received the minimum protection, and if their last vaccine dose was received within the past year, said MOH. 
The arrangement is similar to Influenza vaccination, where individuals are advised to get their shots periodically so as to protect themselves against new strains of the endemic virus as they arise, the ministry added.  
ADDITIONAL BOOSTER FOR THOSE AGED 50 AND ABOVE
Those aged 50 and above who have achieved minimum protection should also receive an additional booster dose between five months to a year from their last jab in order to keep up to date with their vaccination. 
The updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccine is also recommended for this group, said the Health Ministry. 
From Oct 17, those in this age group as well as those who have yet to achieve minimum protection will be able to receive the updated bivalent vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme.

MODERNA/SPIKEVAX BIVALENT COVID-19 VACCINE 
MOH also announced that the current mRNA vaccines will be replaced by bivalent vaccines, as recommended by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination. 
The updated bivalent vaccines will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants, added MOH. 
In September, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted interim authorisation for the Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron COVID-19 jab by Moderna. The vaccine comprises two components that target the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant respectively. 
From Oct 17, the original Moderna/Spikevax vaccines will be replaced with the updated bivalent version for all vaccinations. This is for all adults aged 18 and above. 
Those aged 50 and above, or people who have yet to achieve minimum protection against COVID-19, are advised to opt for the bivalent vaccines as they are at higher risk of severe illness.
Individuals may walk into any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre offering the Moderna/Spikevax jab from Oct 17 onwards to receive their dose. The various centres can be located via the VaccineGoWhere website.
PFIZER'S COMIRNATY BIVALENT BOOSTER
HSA also granted interim authorisation for Pfizer's Comirnaty bivalent booster vaccine on Oct 25.
It comprises two components - 15 micrograms targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and 15 micrograms targeting the Omnicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
The Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is authorised for use as a booster shot for people aged 12 and above who have received primary series COVID-19 vaccination.
Children aged between five and 11 will also be able to receive the Comirnaty vaccine as a booster dose.

SINOVAC-CORONAVAC ALLOWED AS BOOSTER DOSE
There are people aged 18 and above who have been vaccinated with three doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac but have yet to receive a booster. 
MOH said that this was a cause for concern as the regime does not confer the minimum protection required.
According to the Health Ministry, local data has shown that compared to two doses of the mRNA vaccines, three doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine does confer protection against severe disease. 
The three-dose Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine regime has an effectiveness of 70 per cent, compared to more than 80 per cent with three doses of mRNA vaccines. 
For better protection, MOH recommended those who have only received three doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine to receive the updated Moderna/Spikevax bivalent vaccine, or alternatively, the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine. 
However, the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine will now also be allowed as a booster dose, without the need for proof of medical ineligibility to the mRNA or Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccines, said the Health Ministry. 
This is ""to encourage those who otherwise have not received a booster vaccination to minimally receive a booster dose"".

69-year-old cleaner killed by reversing lorry at Hougang 1 mall; workplace fatalities exceed 2021 numbers,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-fatality-38-death-record-cleaner-lorry-hougang-1-mall-2994911,"SINGAPORE: A 69-year-old cleaner was killed by a reversing lorry on Wednesday (Oct 5), bringing the number of workplace fatalities in 2022 to 38.
This exceeds the 37 workplace deaths reported for the whole of last year.
In a statement released on Friday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the fatal accident took place at Hougang 1 shopping mall at 1 Hougang Street 91, at about 9.50am on Wednesday.
The cleaner was hit by a reversing lorry at the loading/unloading bay. The Singaporean man was then taken to Sengkang General Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, said MOM.
""As a general safety measure, drivers of reversing vehicles must be alert to pedestrians or other workers straying into their vehicles' blind spots,"" a ministry spokesperson said.
""Where possible, they should seek help to guide them in reversing their vehicles.
Workers should also stay vigilant and keep a proper lookout for any moving vehicles while at work.""
MOM identified the occupier of the site of the fatality as Serene Land and the cleaner's employer as Avon Cleaning Services.
Last month, in response to the string of workplace fatalities this year, the ministry imposed a mandatory safety time-out for the first time.
It has been conducting compliance checks from Oct 1, and has said it will debar errant companies from employing new foreign employees for one month.
A six-month “heightened safety” period has also been introduced, from Sep 1 till Feb 28, 2023.

But 20 food stall licensees failed to ensure their food handlers complied with the requirements, and were issued written warnings.
""These licensees will face enforcement fines if they fail to comply with these requirements again,"" said the agency. 
Those found guilty can face a fine of up to S$10,000, up to 12 months' jail, or both. 
Mask-wearing requirements for food handlers continue to apply even though wider mask-wearing regulations were eased on Aug 24. 
""Food can still be contaminated by food handlers through coughing and sneezing onto food during the preparation and handling process,"" said SFA.

COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months to 4 years to start from Oct 25,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-singapore-children-6-months-4-years-moh-2994671,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will begin offering COVID-19 vaccinations for children between the ages of six months and four years starting on Oct 25, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Oct 7).
Children between the ages of five and 11 will also be able to get their booster doses from this date, MOH said in a news release.
This is ""to ensure that our children attain a minimum level of protection and remain up-to-date with their vaccinations"", MOH added.
Children aged between six months and four years will be able to receive the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine for their primary vaccination.
Those aged between five and 11 will be able to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine as a booster dose.
""MOH has accepted the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) that children aged six months and above be vaccinated against COVID-19,"" the ministry said.
""Following the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) authorisation of the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine for use in children aged six months to five years, the EC19V recommends the vaccine for primary vaccination for this age group.""
The recommended Moderna/Spikevax vaccine dosage for this age group is two doses of 25 micrograms each, spaced eight weeks apart.
""The vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty, which is a three-dose vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years, has also been approved and we are awaiting delivery. It should be available by the end of the year,"" MOH added.
From Oct 18, parents or guardians of children aged between six months and four years may register their interest for their child or ward to receive the Moderna/Spikevax vaccination here.





      Designated COVID-19 vaccination centres for children
  

To facilitate vaccination for children, five designated vaccination centres offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty jab for those aged five to 11 and Moderna/Spikevax vaccine for those aged six months to four years will begin operations from Oct 25.
They are located at:
One Punggol
Our Tampines Hub
Queenstown Community Centre
Sembawang Community Club
Taman Jurong Community Club
MOH said these vaccination centres will be manned by staff members trained in administering vaccinations for children. 
The Health Ministry also said three polyclinics will come on board to support vaccinations for those aged six months to four years, while four polyclinics will support vaccinations for those aged five to 11 years old.
Selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) will also support the vaccination programme.
Parents or guardians can also locate the nearest vaccination site available for their child or ward at the VaccineGoWhere website.

FROM MRNA TO BIVALENT
MOH said it would also roll out bivalent vaccines for booster jabs later this month.
""This updated bivalent vaccine will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants,"" it said.
""MOH will therefore replace the original Moderna/Spikevax vaccines with the updated bivalent version from Oct 17, 2022, for all vaccinations using the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, for all adults aged 18 years and above.
""Hence, for persons aged 50 and above, or for persons yet to achieve minimum protection, as they are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection, they should take the bivalent vaccines.""
The Pfizer/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is undergoing evaluation and is expected to be available by the end of this year, the ministry added.
It also announced a transition away from the current system of counting jabs.
""Instead of counting the number of shots and boosters we receive, we will transit to a new definition of up-to-date vaccination,"" the ministry said.
""This is similar to influenza vaccination, where individuals are advised to take them periodically, so as to protect ourselves against new strains of the endemic influenza virus as they arise.""
Under this regime, MOH said it would recommend that those aged five years and above complete three mRNA or Novavax/Nuvaxovid doses, or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses, to achieve minimum protection.
""After achieving minimum protection, persons aged 50 years and above should receive an additional booster dose between five months to one year from their last dose, to keep up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccination,"" said the ministry, adding that it recommended taking the bivalent vaccine for this booster.
""Individuals will be considered up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received at least the minimum protection and their last vaccine dose was received within the past one year.""

"'Tactical' breathing, trained instinct: How SAF fighter pilots, bomb experts sprang into action for SQ33 threat","Last month, two Singapore air force jets were scrambled after a passenger claimed to have a bomb in his carry-on bag. This later proved false.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sq33-bomb-hoax-rsaf-air-force-fighter-planes-2994466,"SINGAPORE: Major Leow Yee Shiang was on edge when he first found out he had been activated for a potential bomb threat on a flight returning to Singapore.
A passenger onboard Singapore Airlines flight SQ33, which was en route from San Francisco on Sep 27, had allegedly claimed to have a bomb in a carry-on bag.
“I was definitely initially anxious as lives were at risk but quickly my operational instincts kicked in,” said the 34-year-old Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter pilot, in a media interview on Friday (Oct 7).

What we know about the false bomb threat on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33













A combination of ""tactical"" breathing methods - practiced by military forces to slow one's breath rate - and trust in his training helped MAJ Leow to focus on the task at hand.
As he made his way to his F16C/D fighter jet, teams from different units also sprang into action.
Military Expert 4 (ME4) Sandeep Singh, the officer in charge of activation on the ground, was already busy coordinating preparations and safety checks before take-off.
“Everything was actually moving pretty fast, every minute was very crucial at that point in time,” he said.
“The most important thing in my mind, as well as (for) the guys on the ground, was to ensure that we launch the aircraft on time and that this was being executed safely.”
Within minutes, two F16C/D fighter jets were ready for take-off, and the mission to intercept SQ33 and escort it safely to Changi Airport was underway.
During this time, Air Warfare officer Mark Heng was communicating with the flight captain of SQ33.
“The pilot sounded normal, there was no sign of distress that we are trained to pick up,” said Captain Heng, adding that the pilot had followed instructions - including to descend to a certain altitude and make specific turns.
Meanwhile, the two F16C/D fighter jets maintained a safe distance as they monitored the airplane.
“I established visual contact with the aircraft captain and we also established communications with the captain via the assigned frequency, so that they know that we have intercepted the aircraft,” said MAJ Leow.
“From there, it was about ensuring that (the plane) complied with our air traffic control instructions as well as providing updates on the aircraft's flight parameters all the way until its landing.”
At 5.51am on Sep 28 - three hours after the Singapore Police was first alerted to the bomb threat - the plane landed safely at Changi Airport, under the escort of the F16C/D fighter jets. 
It was then over to teams from the Singapore Armed Forces’ Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group plus the Airport Police Division to quickly remove the suspected bomb from the aircraft, for the safety of those onboard as well as the public.
Among them was Explosive Ordnance Disposal officer and full-time national serviceman Foo Shi Jian.

The 22-year-old Second Lieutenant said he was extremely nervous when he first received the call to activate his team.
“I didn’t expected my guys to be activated so soon,” he said, adding that he had only joined the unit two months ago.
“However, we didn’t have any time to hesitate or sweat over it as we had to constantly think of different contingency plans for possible scenarios that could happen in the next few moments,” said 2LT Foo.
He added that his training had also prepared him and his team to handle such an uncertain situation.
'SENSE OF PRIDE'
Shortly after the plane landed, the 37-year-old man who had made the bomb threat was handed over to the police and arrested for making false threats of terrorist acts and for suspected consumption of controlled drugs. He has been charged with causing alarm and will return to court on Oct 13.
Passengers were eventually allowed to disembark, ending a nearly seven-hour ordeal since the police were first alerted to the alleged bomb threat.
Taking turns to recount their experience to reporters during a media interview on Friday, MAJ Leow, ME4 Sandeep, CPT Heng and 2LT Foo all credited the success of the mission to their rigorous training. 
""Our training is realistic and rigorous, so when the activation happened, (our instincts kicked in) naturally,"" said MAJ Leow.
“I felt a huge sense of relief after the aircraft landed safely onto the tarmac of the Singapore Changi Airport.""
He added: “I also felt a great sense of achievement that the whole team was able to respond to this threat within minutes at night, to conduct our mission and (do) what we are supposed to do to safeguard our Singapore skies.
“There was definitely after that a sense of pride and sense of accomplishment.”"
All COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated measures to be lifted from Oct 10: MOH,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-differentiated-measures-lifted-oct-10-dining-nightlife-events-2994596,"SINGAPORE: All COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated measures will be lifted from Oct 10, with restrictions no longer in place for dining in, nightlife establishments and events with more than 500 participants. 
""We have learned to live with the COVID-19 virus, having weathered several infection waves and progressively lifted safe management measures,"" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a news release on Friday (Oct 7).
""As we resume normalcy in our daily activities, we will lift the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures fully from Oct 10, 2022.""
This means there will be no vaccination-differentiated restrictions for: 
Events with more than 500 participants at any one time
Nightlife establishments where dancing among patrons is one of the intended activities
Dining in at food and beverage establishments, including hawker centres. 
""(The measures have) served us well in our journey to safe reopening,"" said MOH. 
Singapore has significantly eased COVID-19 measures, with mask-wearing not required except on public transport, as well as in healthcare and residential care settings. 
Group size limits and safe-distancing measures have also been lifted. SafeEntry and TraceTogether requirements were also removed for most settings.
All employees are allowed to return to the workplace, and the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was lowered from Orange to Yellow after more than two years. 
The DORSCON framework, which gives an indication of the current disease situation, was raised to Orange on Feb 7, 2020, at the start of the pandemic.
The ministry added that the measures have helped to protect those who are not fully vaccinated by reducing their exposure to settings with a higher risk of transmission, and in turn keeping the healthcare system from being overwhelmed when population-wide vaccination and infection rates were not yet sufficiently high. 
However, even as the measures are lifted, people who are not fully vaccinated continue to face a higher risk of severe disease, said the Health Ministry. 
""We urge such persons to come forward to be vaccinated, or continue to take their own precautions and minimise social interactions to protect themselves."" 
MOH also reminded members of the public to continue to remain vigilant and be ready to respond to any dangerous new variants, even as most safe management measures are eased. 
It added that should the situation worsen, necessary measures may be put in place at ""short notice"" to protect the public, safeguard healthcare workers and conserve hospital capacity. 
This may include ""standing up"" an appropriate level of vaccination-differentiated measures, as was necessary during the height of the pandemic.
MOH noted that as of Thursday, average daily infections in the community over a seven-day period rose from around 2,600 a week ago to 4,400.
Hospitalised cases have also increased from 247 a week ago to 342, and the number of Intensive Care Unit cases increased from nine to 13 in the same period.
""This is likely due to increased social activities, safe management measures being stepped down, and also the BA.2.75 and BA.2.10 Omicron subvariants, which have been detected around the world, now circulating in Singapore,"" said MOH, adding that the rise in daily cases was ""not unexpected"".
""What is important is to protect our healthcare capacity, and ensure that infections do not translate into large numbers of severely ill patients,"" said the ministry.
""We need to each keep our COVID-19 vaccination up-to-date as vaccination has become our primary defence against COVID-19.""

SCDF said lift technicians were already at the scene and working to release the lift doors. 
""Throughout the incident, SCDF remained in communication with the six persons and assessed that there was no immediate medical emergency,"" it said.
""SCDF also used hydraulic equipment to create a small gap between the lift doors to improve ventilation.""
West Coast Town Council said the lift's lights and fans were functioning normally while the passengers were inside.

At about 2.45pm, the lift technicians managed to open the lift doors and assessed a person for breathing difficulties, said SCDF.
It added that the person refused to be conveyed to the hospital.
The town council said that lift technicians also conducted a detailed inspection of the lift and it resumed operation on the same day.
""We would like to apologise to the family for the unpleasant experience,"" it added.
Facebook user Keine Brutalitat posted about the incident on Wednesday and said that friends and family had to pry the lift doors open with an umbrella to create a gap for ventilation.
Two people were seen fanning at the gap to cool the air inside the lift the user added.
In the post, the user also pointed to residents claiming that lift breakdowns occur frequently at the location, and that the lift could only hold three people before it overloads."
High Court quashes conviction of man who went to jail instead of his daughter over traffic accident,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/high-court-quashes-conviction-man-jail-instead-daughter-traffic-accident-2994216,"SINGAPORE: The High Court on Friday (Oct 7) quashed the conviction of a man who took the fall for his daughter by pleading guilty and going to jail in her stead over a road traffic accident.
Mr David Ong pleaded guilty in September 2020 in the State Courts to his purported role in a car accident, where his car collided with a motorcycle along Tampines Avenue 2 in October 2019.
The motorcyclist sustained a wrist fracture and Mr Ong pleaded guilty to the offence of causing grievous hurt by an act in a negligent manner endangering human life or the personal safety of others.
The in-car camera footage of another car captured the collision, and the footage was played in the State Courts. Mr Ong confirmed what happened and was sentenced to five days' jail, which he served. He was also banned from driving for two years.
He claimed he was responsible for the accident, which was a result of his negligence and fatigue from working long hours.
However, after the conviction, new information came to the attention of the prosecution. In April this year, the police were alerted to an audio recording from Mr Ong's in-car camera footage of a conversation between Mr Ong and his daughter, Ms Audrey Ong Hui Ling.
Immediately after the collision, the conversation suggested that Mr Ong had informed his daughter that he would ""take her place"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Santhra Aiyyasamy.
The case was reviewed and it was determined that Mr Ong was not the driver at the time. Instead, he had lied to the police to shield his daughter from prosecution, said Ms Aiyyasamy.
She urged the court to quash his conviction, as it was ""palpably wrong"". The court accordingly quashed the conviction on Friday (Oct 7).
Ms Aiyyasamy said it was ""a serious injustice"" for Mr Ong to have been punished instead. He ""perverted the course of justice by taking the blame for an offence on behalf of another person"", said the prosecutor.
She added that further injustice may result if the victim seeks to launch a civil suit against the driver of the car.
CNA has contacted the Attorney-General's Chambers on whether any action will be taken against Ms Ong and Mr Ong.
In response to CNA's queries, the police said that they are unable to comment as investigations are ongoing."
Man gets jail for throwing knife out of 4th-storey window while arguing with wife,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-gets-jail-throwing-knife-out-4th-storey-window-while-arguing-wife-killer-litter-court-2993991,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Friday (Oct 7) for throwing a knife out of his fourth-storey flat during a dispute with his wife.
Muhammad Adam Samsu Bari, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of a rash act endangering human life.
The court heard that Adam was with his wife in their flat at Block 484, Choa Chu Kang Avenue 5 at about 1pm on Jul 3 this year when they began quarrelling about financial matters.
Adam was in the kitchen preparing curry puffs while his wife was in a room. The pair shouted at each other as they quarrelled, and the argument grew heated.
Adam then threw a knife he was holding in his hand in the direction of the shelves near an open window.
The knife, which had an 18cm-long blade, fell out of the window and landed on the ground floor behind a nursery. No one was hurt.
A passer-by called the police at about 1.20pm, saying that there was a dispute between husband and wife. The police arrived at the scene and recovered the knife.
The prosecutor asked for six to eight weeks' jail, noting that Adam had previous convictions but none similar to the current charge. 
He said there was a need for general deterrence in killer litter cases, given the prevalence of high-rise buildings in Singapore. The object thrown here was a knife, which had greater potential to cause hurt to others, he added.
Adam gave only a written mitigation plea to the judge and asked if he could defer his sentence for a week. His wife stood bail for him. The judge granted his request and he will begin his jail term later this month.
For committing a rash act endangering human life, Adam could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$2,500, or both."
Singapore and China's continued collaboration will create new opportunities for businesses: Lawrence Wong,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-and-chinas-continued-collaboration-will-create-new-opportunities-businesses-lawrence-wong-2993911,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore and China continue to collaborate in emerging areas of the economy, this will open up new opportunities for businesses on both sides, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Oct 7).
Speaking at the Future China Global Forum, Mr Wong said Singapore has consistently participated in and supported China as it opened up and reformed its economy over the past four decades.
This included establishing major Government-to-Government projects such as Tianjin Eco-City and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, to support China’s economic development through its different phases.
These efforts have helped to strengthen ties between the two countries over the years, with China now Singapore’s largest trading partner while Singapore, China’s largest foreign investor, he pointed out, adding that the relationship is also reflected in close links between businesses and people.
“We are not standing still. Both countries continue to build on this strong foundation by collaborating in emerging areas of the new economy, such as the digital economy and the green economy,” said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
“This will open up new opportunities for businesses in both our countries in areas such as digital trade, digitally-enabled services, renewable energy, green financing, as well as environmental services.”
""GOLDEN AGE IS OVER""
During his speech, Mr Wong also noted that the world was entering a new era of geopolitical contestation that would bring about more economic decoupling and fragmentation.
“(The) golden age of globalisation that we enjoyed for more than 30 years is over,” he said.
“Previously, we all saw companies going for just-in-time efficiencies and lowest cost; now everyone talks about just-in-case precautions and greater resilience.
""Previously we all thought that countries did not have to be friends to do business. In fact, having more trade and investments was a very good thing, because it would tamp down geopolitical rivalry; but now there is a new logic at work: Geopolitical forces are shaping economics, trade and finance,” he added.
While no one can predict the kind of world order that would emerge from this, what is clear is that United States-China relations are consequential and will set the tone for global affairs, said Mr Wong.
“Unfortunately, relations between both countries have worsened over the past few years, we have seen an impact on trade, investment, and finance – not just between the two countries, but across the rest of the world too,” he said.
“If relations between the US and China continue to be fraught, we could witness further bifurcation of technology, splitting of supply chains, or even other unintended consequences.
“The reality is that both China and US are highly interdependent, and interlinked in the global economy ... Even selective decoupling will come at great costs for companies everywhere, and certainly for our region and the world.""
FUTURE OF GLOBAL ORDER
Despite this state of affairs, Mr Wong said Asia, which has enjoyed more than 50 years of peace and stability since the end of the Vietnam War, should not resign itself to these external challenges.
“We should do whatever we can to find stability and to steer the trajectory of developments in the region towards peace and stability,” he said, adding that how US-China relations unfold would be an important factor.
“Neither side expects relations to improve any time soon,” Mr Wong noted.
“But we must all hope that relations do not worsen, and that there are no accidents or miscalculations that can make things much worse very quickly.”
With leaders from US and China due to meet in person soon, the hope is that both sides will reach an agreement, where they may compete vigorously in many areas, but also find ways to expand common ground and cooperate on areas of mutual interests, he said.
Mr Wong added: “In fact, there are indeed many global challenges which require joint US-China leadership to overcome – such as strengthening our global pandemic preparedness and marshalling global support to address the effects of climate change.""
Returning to Asia, he said countries should also recognise that the future of the global order will not be defined by US and China alone.
He stressed the need to stand firm on fundamental principles of international law, and to work with others to strengthen multilateralism and uphold the rules-based order.
“Singapore and ASEAN may not be able to do much to influence the course of US-China relations. But we will do all that we can to keep the region open and inclusive,” he said, adding that this includes encouraging major partners such as the European Union, Japan and India to build stakes in the region.
“Because for all of us in Singapore and ASEAN – this is not a matter of choosing sides; but it’s about making choices for ourselves, advancing our collective interests, and doing what is best for our peoples.”"
11 Thomson-East Coast Line stations to open on Nov 13; free rides available on Nov 11 ,"The new Thomson-East Coast Line stations are: Stevens, Napier, Orchard Boulevard, Orchard, Great World, Havelock, Outram Park, Maxwell, Shenton Way, Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/thomson-east-coast-line-open-november-mrt-free-rides-11-stations-2994101,"SINGAPORE: Eleven MRT stations along the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) will officially open for passenger service on Nov 13, announced the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Friday (Oct 7). 
Spanning 13.2km, the stations are Stevens, Napier, Orchard Boulevard, Orchard, Great World, Havelock, Outram Park, Maxwell, Shenton Way, Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay.
Four of these are interchange stations. And collectively, they connect TEL commuters to all the existing MRT lines, said LTA in a media factsheet. 
Stevens station will connect to Downtown Line while Orchard station will provide a connection to North-South Line. Outram Park and Marina Bay stations are both three-line interchanges, with Outram Park connecting to the East-West Line and North-East Line, and Marina Bay connecting to the North-South Line and Circle Line.
“This is a very important addition to our MRT system. (The 11 stations) have very important points of intersection with the existing MRT lines. And therefore, it adds much resilience and of course, convenience through interconnectivity for commuters in Singapore,” said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Friday.

FREE TRAVEL ON NOV 11
An opening event will be held on Nov 11 and commuters can travel for free along the new stations from 10am to 9pm on that day. 
LTA said other activities will be held to mark the opening of the newest stage of the TEL, and these will be announced on its social media pages. 
The 11 new stations come under Stage 3 of the TEL. Another two stations under Stage 3 – Mount Pleasant and Marina South – will open only when housing developments around them are ready.  
Stage 2, comprising six stations from Springleaf to Caldecott, started passenger service in August 2021, adding to the three stations in Woodlands that opened in 2020 in Stage 1.

With the latest stations, more than 180,000 households will be within a 10-minute walk from one of the 18 TEL stations. The line runs from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay.
“(Passengers) can expect travel time savings of around 40 per cent,” said LTA. “For example, a Bright Hill resident travelling to Gardens by the Bay will take 40 minutes via TEL as compared to about 65 minutes currently. 
“As segments of the TEL runs parallel to the North-South Line, it will also help to reduce reliance and commuter load on NSL.”
The entire TEL – comprising 32 stations with eight interchange stations – was initially expected to be fully operational in 2024. However, the timeline for completion was pushed back.
The opening of Stage 2, for instance, was delayed twice - first due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second delay came after the Land Transport Authority conducted a system review following a five-hour disruption on the line in December 2020 due to a signalling fault. 
Stage 4, which comprises eight stations such as Tanjong Katong, Marine Parade and Siglap, is expected to open in 2024. The final Stage 5, which comprises Bedok South and Sungei Bedok stations, will open in 2025.
“We started with five stations in one line 35 years ago. Today, we have 190 stations. And we continue to build,” said Mr Iswaran.
”So I think what we need to keep in perspective is the larger strategy of enhancing our MRT infrastructure, making public transport a very convenient and accessible form of commute for all Singaporeans, which is greener, which is also one that will … enhance the liveability of our city.
“It will also mean that we have a more resilient MRT infrastructure for all commuters.”

"Mandatory rest day for maids can be taken any day of the week, policy effective Jan 1: MOM","The rest day can also be taken as one full day or over two half-days, and can be deferred by up to one calendar month, says the Manpower Ministry.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ministry-manpower-maids-foreign-domestic-workers-mandatory-rest-days-any-day-week-2023-2994036,"SINGAPORE: From Jan 1, 2023, migrant domestic workers will get at least one rest day a month - which they can take on any day of the week, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday (Oct 7).
This monthly rest day has to be provided by employers and cannot be compensated away, as first announced in July last year.
The rest day can be taken as one full day or over two half-days, and migrant domestic workers can choose to spend the rest day at home, said MOM in a press release outlining details of the new policy.
The rest day can also be deferred by up to one calendar month.
""This means that, should both parties agree to defer the rest day in that month, the migrant domestic worker should take her rest day by the end of the subsequent month,"" said MOM.

MOM said the measure aims to allow migrant domestic workers to rest and recharge from work and form ""networks of support"" outside of the household.
The ministry urged employers, especially those whose households have caregiving needs, to discuss and make plans with their migrant domestic workers early.
“Supporting the well-being of our migrant domestic workers is important as they will also be better able to support their employers,"" said Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang.
Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said: ""Having adequate rest is beneficial for one’s physical and mental health ... CDE will work with MOM to help employers and MDWs adjust to this new policy change and assist with any concerns and queries about the arrangement.”

Singapore unveils strategy to counter terrorism financing,"The National Strategy for Countering the Financing of Terrorism comprises actions to prevent, detect, investigate and enforce aspects of terrorism financing.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/government-strategy-counter-terrorism-financing-2994016,"SINGAPORE: The Goverment unveiled a strategy against terrorism financing on Friday (Oct 7).
Called The National Strategy for Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT), the strategy comprises actions to prevent, detect, investigate and enforce aspects of terrorism financing, a joint press release by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Monetary Authority of Singapore stated. 
The authorities stated that the strategy was formulated based on findings from an assessment of terrorism financing risk conducted in 2020. 
""Singapore’s key terrorism financing threats are posed by regional and international terrorist groups as well as radicalised individuals, as they raise, move and use financial resources for terrorism purposes,"" the press release stated. 
Singapore has seen several terrorism financing cases in recent years, including a Bangladeshi national working as a construction worker in Singapore who donated to fund-raising campaigns to support a terrorist group.
Others include a Singaporean businessman who gave another man money to facilitate the latter's journey to Syria to join a terrorist group.

In announcing the new strategy, the authorities highlighted that payment service providers and banks carrying out cross-border money transfers were more vulnerable to terrorism financing threats, given the ""relative ease and speed with which their services may be used"". 
In February, company SGCN Link had its registration cancelled by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) after it failed to take enhanced measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorism financing risks when incorporating companies.
The authorities also noted Singapore's status as a financial and transport hub with a proximity to countries exposed to terrorism activities. 
The National CFT strategy spreads across five main points: Coordinated and comprehensive risk identification; strong legal and sanctions frameworks; robust regulatory regime and risk-targeted supervisory framework; decisive law enforcement actions; and international partnerships and cooperation. 
Broadly, these involve government agencies coordinating and taking into account technologies, standards and requirements for action, with input from the private sector and academia. 
The strategy also calls for collaboration with the private sector in detecting and disrupting such threats. 
As part of the strategy, regulatory frameworks should also be comprehensive and robust, to enable law enforcement authorities to take swift action against terrorists and related entities. 
""Singapore remains committed to taking firm and resolute action against TF (terrorism financing) to keep our country, region, and the world safe from terrorist activities,"" the press release added.

"Club hostess who took lift from drunk customer sues him over traffic accident, court finds him 75% liable ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/club-hostess-who-took-lift-drunk-customer-sues-him-over-traffic-accident-court-finds-him-75-liable-2993966,"SINGAPORE: A club hostess who accepted a lift from a drunk customer sued him after they got into a traffic accident on an expressway, leaving her with injuries but him unscathed.
In a judgment issued by a Magistrate's Court on Friday (Oct 7), a judge found the driver 75 per cent liable and accorded 25 per cent of liability to the woman.
According to the judgment, the plaintiff Ms Oh Jin Lian worked at Club De Zara at the time of the incident, serving drinks and entertaining customers.
The defendant, Mr Daryl Gui Wee Teck, visited the club with his friends on Sep 1, 2019. They had a private room and drank from about 10pm to about 2am the next morning.
Mr Gui and his friends then left the club and went to Club Gaga, where they continued drinking until about 5am.
Ms Oh, who had attended to Mr Gui's party at various points at Club De Zara, also went to Club Gaga with her own group, joining Mr Gui's group from time to time.
At about 5am, both groups made plans to leave, intending at first to take taxis home, with Ms Oh and Mr Gui sharing a cab.
However, after Ms Oh's colleague and Mr Gui's friends left, Mr Gui tried to drive Ms Oh home. They were both drunk at the time.
On the way home along the Central Expressway, they got into an accident and Ms Oh sustained injuries that were unspecified in court documents. She later sued Mr Gui.
DRIVER ARGUED THAT HOSTESS DID NOT WEAR SEATBELT
Mr Gui did not dispute that he was negligent, but disputed liability, saying that Ms Oh had taken a lift from him even though she knew he was drunk.
He also asserted that Ms Oh did not wear a seatbelt and said she had distracted him by tapping his hand and asking him to look at her while he was driving.
District Judge Ng Tee Tze Allen found that the evidence did not support the finding that Ms Oh had not worn a seatbelt. On the point of Ms Oh allegedly distracting Mr Gui, Mr Gui did not rely on this allegation and did not raise the point in his closing arguments. As a result, the judge made no finding on this.
Judge Ng accepted that a passenger can be guilty of contributory negligence if they accept a lift from a driver they know is drunk.
Ms Oh had argued that she accepted the lift because Mr Gui insisted on giving her one. She claimed that she did not know how much Mr Gui had drunk that night, and said Mr Gui had ""held out himself as someone being fit to drive"".
The judge accepted that it was Mr Gui who offered Ms Oh a lift, even though Mr Gui initially claimed that Ms Oh had asked him for a ride home. 
Judge Ng said he ""had little doubt"" that Ms Oh knew that Mr Gui had drunk a lot before he offered her a lift home. Even though there was some dispute as to how much time Ms Oh spent with Mr Gui that night, they were in the same nightclubs between 10pm and 5am and Ms Oh had seen Mr Gui drinking.
It was also Ms Oh's own evidence that she had been working in nightclubs for more than a year at the time, so she would have known that patrons such as Mr Gui would have been drinking, said Judge Ng.
Ms Oh should have appreciated the risk of Mr Gui being in no position to drive, said Judge Ng. This was underscored when a fellow hostess asked Ms Oh to take a taxi home with Mr Gui instead.
The judge rejected Ms Oh's assertion that Mr Gui ""held himself as someone being fit to drive"", pointing to how she admitted on cross-examination that she had not asked Mr Gui if he was fit to drive, nor did she check if he was fit to drive.
The judge found that Ms Oh had failed to take reasonable measures to guard against foreseeable harm.
""Even though she knew that the defendant had been drinking for six to seven hours, she placed her life in his hands by allowing him to drive her home without even checking whether he was in a state to do so,"" said the judge.
Judge Ng found that Ms Oh was not ""free from blame"", as she knew that Mr Gui had been drinking and could have chosen not to enter his car.
""Indeed, given her occupation, it might be said that she should have been more alive to the risks of accepting rides from drunk drivers than most,"" he said.
However, he added that Mr Gui was also not free from blame - he knew he had been drinking for six to seven hours and should not be driving, but still offered to drive Ms Oh home.
""While the plaintiff may have put herself in harm's way by accepting a lift from the defendant, it was the defendant who initiated the drive. It was also the defendant who was controlling the car. Quite clearly, he had greater control over whether parties met with an accident or not,"" said the judge.
He gave interlocutory judgment for Ms Oh to the extent of 75 per cent of the damages to be assessed."

The Singapore Police Force said in a release on Friday (Oct 7) that four women and 13 men aged between 24 and 61 were arrested for their suspected involvement in the sales of illegal streaming devices, which enable consumers to access unauthorised content from illicit sources online.
On Tuesday, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department raided shops in Sim Lim Square and seized more than 2,500 sets of these devices, said the police.
""The estimated street value of these devices is more than S$500,000,"" said the authority, adding that its investigations are ongoing.
The English football Premier League, which opened its first international office in Singapore in 2019, on Friday expressed appreciation for the police's enforcement actions.
""The Premier League is committed to tackling piracy and worked closely with the SPF in preparation for the raid, including providing support on the day,"" it said in a statement.
Premier League general counsel Kevin Plumb said the raids reinforced the authorities’ commitment to tackling piracy and to demonstrate that illegal operations will be removed. 
“We know the vast majority of our fans in Singapore watch Premier League action via authorised content and we want to protect that,"" he said. ""We will continue to work together with local authorities to target and take action against those offering illegal access to Premier League matches.
















Last year, telco StarHub said it would offer two years of free rental of its StarHub TV+ box worth S$120 to customers who turn in their old pirate set-top boxes.
This was on the heels of a Copyright Bill tabled in Parliament in July 2021, rendering it illegal to sell these boxes.
The Bill was passed into law in September and its provisions kicked in around November last year.
Under the Copyright Act 2021, infringement by making, dealing, importing, distributing or offering of devices or services to access works without the authority of copyright owners carries a fine up to S$100,000, an imprisonment term of up to five years, or both.
""The Police take a serious view of intellectual property rights infringement and would like to remind the public that the distribution and sales of illegal streaming devices are serious offences,"" it said in its Friday release.
""The Police will not hesitate to take tough action against perpetrators.""
Last month, it was revealed that a total of 245 domains associated with 30 illegal streaming sites are now blocked in Singapore.

Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, on Friday (Oct 7) received one charge of failing to wear a mask over her nose and mouth while in ION Orchard for about 15 minutes.
She allegedly did so between 11.48am and 12.03pm on Aug 16, 2022, days before the mask rule was lifted in most places except on public transport and in certain places like healthcare settings.
Phoon now faces four charges in total. She received the other three in September, for failing to wear a mask twice along Orchard Road in March, and for failing to attend an investigation.
Her case was adjourned to Oct 14, when she will return to court for a pre-trial conference.
She had previously said that she intends to plead guilty.
This is Phoon's second round of offences for failing to wear a mask. She was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail in September last year for the first set.
If convicted of failing to wear a mask when required, Phoon could be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$20,000 or both as a repeat offender.
The penalties are the same for a repeat offence of not complying with an officer during investigations under the Infectious Diseases Act.

"Businesses move to capture lucrative mental wellness market, as more workers face burnout","From bouldering gyms to meditation studios, businesses here are trying to cash in on the growing awareness of mental health issues. Ahead of Mental Health Day on Monday, CNA looks at recent developments.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-wellness-market-employee-burnout-2990896,"SINGAPORE: One would not expect to get some kind of therapy from a bouldering gym. 
But at Project Send, a new bouldering gym situated within The Esplanade Mall, the coaches focus on building mental resilience and self-confidence in their climbers. 
“In the international scene, climbing is seen as a kind of therapy. You need to be very aware of where your strengths and limitations are, so that you can solve the problem that's on the wall,” said Mr Kenneth Ng, director of Project Send.
The gym is one of several businesses here that have added a mental wellness component to their offerings in recent years. For instance, it hosts quarterly workshops that claim to help people get mentally stronger through climbing and breathing techniques.
Businesses in Singapore are moving to capture the lucrative mental wellness market, as more workers deal with work burnout amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A recent report by non-profit organisation Global Wellness Institute (GWI) showed that Singapore’s wellness economy is ranked 14th out of 45 countries in the Asia Pacific region.
This is also a key sector that tourism authorities here are hoping to bank on over the next five to 10 years.
GWI predicts that the wellness economy will top US$7 trillion by 2025.

A LUCRATIVE MARKET
At Project Send, all its corporate-related wellness programmes are oversubscribed.
Mr Ng said the skills learnt in bouldering help climbers perform under pressure in their daily lives.
At the gym, different routes are labelled with corresponding grades, which enables climbers to perform within their abilities.
""(Bouldering) promotes working together with your colleagues because you come here after work and you collaboratively solve something on the wall together. You cheer each other on, you spur each other on, and I think that's a very, very healthy thing to do with your colleague, "" said Mr Ng.
Over at a shophouse on Stanley Street in the Central Business District, sounds of hums and gongs emanate from meditation studio SPACE2B.
The space offers what is known as sound baths. This involves meditating with the practice accompanied by resonant sounds, some of which are produced by singing bowls.
And the studio is now seeing twice as much interest from businesses looking to engage their services, compared to the pre-pandemic days.
“We're getting so many enquiries, so many requests to hold our sessions at the corporate offices, and also for them to come over here, and to have sessions where they can have the overseas colleagues dial in,” said Ms Christina Nikolovski Low, founder of the studio.
“CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE DISCERNING”
As more businesses try to cash in on the rising awareness of mental health issues, Promises Healthcare clinical psychologist Jocelyn Cheng said it is important to make distinctions.
“In terms of mental wellness, there are good supplements or practices that keep up with the idea of self-care,” she added. 
“Then, there is the other aspect, in terms of therapies which of these are scientifically backed-up. So I think that’s where the differentiation lies, and it gets a bit blurred.”
Determining the scientific benefits of programmes, particularly those that are meditation-based, is not straightforward, she said, adding that consumers should be discerning.
""I think we can start looking at whether these programmes that are being run are accredited within Singapore, and if there are some international societies that back them up,” she added.
""If you hear terms like mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or stress reduction, you would be more certain that they are evidence-based secular practices.""

HDB may waive wait-out period for private home owners who obtained option to purchase before new rules,"HDB has received about 450 appeals about the 15-month wait-out period from private home owners looking to buy a resale flat.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-15-month-wait-out-period-waiver-resale-flats-otp-flexibility-2991741,"SINGAPORE: Private home owners looking to buy a Housing Board resale flat may have their 15-month wait-out period waived, if they can show that they obtained an option to purchase (OTP) before the cooling measures kicked in on Sep 30.
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Thursday (Oct 6) that it will “exercise flexibility” in these cases. 
""These buyers would have to show proof of payment of the option fee or the option exercise fee before Sep 30, 2022, for HDB to process their appeals favourably,"" said the agency.
""HDB will also verify internally through our own system for buyers who are using their CPF and/or taking a housing loan for the flat purchase, as such buyers would have to make a Request for Value to HDB.""
The option fee is a way to reserve the property, and it forms part of the total purchase price. 
In an HDB resale transaction, the OTP is valid for 21 days, during which the buyer can exercise his option to purchase, meaning he has legally agreed to buy the flat. 
But the 15-month wait-out period implemented on Sep 30 means resale flat buyers are no longer eligible for the purchase, through no fault of the buyers. In such cases, the OTP will become “null and void”, and the sellers must refund the option fee to the buyer, said HDB.

Condo owners shelving plans to downgrade, others who sold homes are stuck, say agents after cooling measures



















15-month wait for private home owners to buy resale HDB 'a form of deterrence for buyers with deep pockets': Analysts













HALF OF APPEAL CASES OBTAINED OTP BEFORE SEP 30
The wait-out period was among a package of measures announced last week to cool the property market. 
Seniors aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat are unaffected by the new rules.
Following the announcement of cooling measures, HDB has received about 450 appeals about the 15-month wait-out period as of Oct 4. 
Based on a preliminary screening of about 200 appeals, about 50 per cent are cases where an OTP was obtained to buy an HDB resale flat before the measures kicked in on Sep 30. 
The remaining appeals were cases where the OTP to buy a resale flat had not been obtained. 
""These cases may include private home owners or ex-private home owners who have committed to sell or have sold their existing private property,"" said HDB.
“We are reviewing the documents submitted and will access these appeals on a case-by-case basis.""
RISE IN PRIVATE HOME OWNERS BUYING RESALE FLATS 
Explaining its decision to impose the 15-month wait-out period, HDB said the number of private home owners buying resale HDB flats has doubled in 2021 and the first three-quarters of 2022, as compared to 2019 and 2020. 
Previously, private home owners who sold their property did not have to serve a wait-out period before buying a non-subsidised HDB resale flat, but they were required to sell their unit within six months of the HDB flat purchase. 
Private home owners generally have more financial means to buy resale flats, as compared to first-time home buyers or existing HDB owners, the agency noted.
“Some may not even need to take loans to complete their purchase. They therefore tend to pay higher amounts of cash-over-valuation when buying resale flats,"" HDB said.
It added, however, that it recognises not all private home owners share the same situation. 
“We also understand that there are private property owners, regardless of age, who face genuine housing needs or who have to sell their homes because of extenuating circumstances such as financial difficulties,” said HDB. 
“They can approach HDB for assistance, and we will see how best to assist them on a case-by-case basis.”

More Singaporeans keen to learn about mental health and seek help,"However, stigma remains a concern - a CNA survey found that 66 per cent of respondents in Singapore were concerned about the stigma surrounding mental health.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-week-singaporeans-awareness-misconceptions-2991536,"SINGAPORE: Singaporeans are becoming more open to learning about and seeking help for mental health, experts said.
However, misconceptions surrounding the topic remain prevalent, they said.
They pointed to the role of the media, government bodies, and advocacy groups in raising interest and awareness of mental health among Singaporeans, especially the youth. This has moved the needle on people seeking help.
“With this increased awareness, there's also more willingness to come forward to seek treatment. That's the trend we've seen in our hospital – the youth today are more willing to seek mental health help, and their parents as well,” said Dr Lim Choon Guan from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
Dr Lim, a senior consultant and deputy chief at IMH’s department of developmental psychiatry, added that he has been getting an increasing number of queries from students keen on working on mental health-related topics for their A-level projects.
















It’s not just the teenagers who are interested in the topic.
A graded elective on mental health he taught at Nanyang Technological University was oversubscribed every semester, Dr Lim said.
He noted that residency enrolment for psychiatry as a specialist training for IMH’s junior doctors has also been overwhelming.
NOT ENOUGH AVENUES FOR LEARNING
Despite the growing interest in the topic, people may not know where to seek information, Silver Ribbon’s executive director Porsche Poh told CNA.
“A lot of people are keen to learn more. It's just that there aren’t enough platforms for them to share,” said Ms Poh.
Discussions about mental health on social media can be a double-edged sword, Ms Poh noted. While the platforms help with raising awareness, there is also mental health shaming, she said. She recalled the time she saw someone joking about a mental health issue.
“I appealed to the person, saying ‘you wouldn't do that if let’s say this person is your loved one’ and the person just ignored me and said that I'm being sensitive,” she said.
“(There’s) still a long way to go for our community to be more kind and more sensitive towards persons with mental health issues.”



















State of mental health: A survey of countries and territories across Asia | Interactive charts













Stigma remains a concern - a CNA survey found that 66 per cent of respondents in Singapore were concerned about the stigma surrounding mental health.
Ms Poh’s organisation, which advocates mental health, has got creative in sending its message across and starting conversations.
The charity organisation has partnered with theatre group The Necessary Stage for a few years in plays such as Off Centre and Acting Mad, which have been described as “taking an honest and unflinching look at mental illness and the stigma surrounding it”.
During those plays, Silver Ribbon volunteers stand by as mental health responders for audience members who might be affected by the themes.
“There's a need to customise our events according to different target audiences to get their attention, and to provide a platform for everybody to discuss about mental health, so that they know where to seek help and where to refer their loved ones to,” Ms Poh said.
MISCONCEPTIONS, STIGMA SURROUNDING MENTAL HEALTH
Although things are improving on the awareness front, misconceptions remain, the experts said.
Such misconceptions need to be addressed, as they might deter some from seeking help, said Dr Lim.
“It’s quite common to hear young patients or parents ask if being diagnosed with a mental illness means they have to take medications, and if these medications will be lifelong,” said Dr Lim.
“Very often, treatment doesn't necessarily involve medication. There are effective psychological therapies for many conditions as well. And even if a person is started on medication, it is not common for them to require the medication lifelong.”
Dr Lim added that sensational portrayals of persons with mental illness in the media could mislead the public to see them as dangerous or violent, when such cases are “few and far between”.
“In fact, most individuals with mental illnesses are actually not aggressive, violent or dangerous,” said Dr Lim. “So many of them yearn to lead a normal, regular life like each and every one of us. And if given proper treatment, a chance to, they can.”
However, with more information readily available and misconceptions easing, the situation is improving.
Dr Lim gave an example of parents who were more likely to be hesitant to get their child a medical certificate from IMH in the past, as they were afraid that their child would be shunned.
“Some parents were previously hesitant about letting the schools know about their child seeking help as they were worried that these students may be isolated by their friends or teachers,” he said. “But today, schools can offer so much more support. You find parents being very much more willing to share information.”

"Woman fined S$5,500 for evading GST on several luxury bags",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-fined-evading-gst-branded-bags-louis-vuitton-loewe-2991396,"SINGAPORE: A woman was fined S$5,500 on Thursday (Oct 6) for evading goods and service tax (GST) on several luxury bags from brands such as Louis Vuitton and Loewe.
Teo Hwee Ling, 37, was stopped by immigration officers at Changi Airport on May 1 after arriving on a flight from Frankfurt.
They inspected items in a paper bag she was carrying. She was then directed to the Singapore Customs office where she declared two branded bags for tax payment - a Louis Vuitton backpack and a Loewe bag.
""When asked by a Singapore Customs officer to produce the invoices for the two bags, Teo declared that these were gifts from her friend residing in Germany and she had no knowledge of their value,"" Singapore Customs said in a media release.
It added that in the absence of documentation to establish the value of the bags, Teo provided a verbal declaration of €1,000 (about S$1,470 at the time) and made a GST payment of S$68.20 after deducting the GST import relief for travellers.
As she had spent more than 48 hours outside Singapore, she was granted a GST relief of S$500.
Later that month, Singapore Customs received information that there were discrepancies in the declaration made by Teo and the purchases she made overseas. 
""Investigations revealed that Teo had suppressed the value of the two bags which she declared as gifts, when they were Teo’s purchases and were valued at about S$5,060,"" the agency said. 
She had also failed to declare five other items, which were valued at about S$9,240 when she returned to Singapore on May 1. 
According to court documents, the items are a pair of Ferragamo shoes, perfumes and cosmetics, a Longchamp bag, a Chanel bag and a Louis Vuitton sling bag.
The items were not declared and were brought out of the arrival hall in a suitcase, said Singapore Customs. 
It added that the GST that was not paid on the two under-declared bags was about S$250, and the GST leviable on the five undeclared items was about S$640.
The total value of the seven items was more than S$14,000, according to court documents.

Teo pleaded guilty to one charge of fraudulent evasion of GST. One charge of furnishing false information was also taken into consideration during sentencing.
""It is the responsibility of all arriving travellers to make an accurate and complete declaration of the dutiable and taxable items in their possession for duty and GST payment,"" Singapore Customs said.
Under the Customs Act, anyone found guilty of fraudulent evasion of GST faces a fine of up to 20 times the amount of tax evaded, a jail term of up to two years, or both.
""Refusing to answer questions or knowingly giving false information or furnishing false documents are serious offences under the Customs Act,"" said the agency, adding that offenders can be fined up to S$5,000 and/or jailed for up to 12 months.

2 men fined for sending messages to chat groups to tip off nightclub workers about police raids,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2-men-fined-sending-messages-chat-groups-tip-nightclub-workers-about-police-raids-2991471,"SINGAPORE: Two managers of entertainment outlets were fined by a court on Thursday (Oct 6) for sending messages to chat groups to tip other workers off about police raids.
Disco and karaoke outlet operations manager Goh Wei Jie, 35, was fined S$10,000. He pleaded guilty to three counts of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, with another two similar charges taken into consideration.
General manager of a nightlife entertainment outlet Raymund Reuben Mervyn, 43, was fined S$7,000 for one count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, with a second similar charge considered. 
Both men said they would pay their fines in full.
The court heard that the existence of these chat groups came to light in April 2019, when a Malaysian man was detained at Woodlands Checkpoint for failing to declare that he had on him cash of more than S$20,000.
A check of his phone revealed two chat groups: Rolex Movement and Night Owl. These chats were used by security officers or employees of night entertainment outlets in Singapore to send each other tip-off messages about ongoing or upcoming police raids.
The members would include details such as licence plate numbers of police vehicles, the size of the raiding teams and the locations, using code words and abbreviations that the other members understood.
Further chat groups named UncleValet and Pao Pao Bing Tuan were uncovered in February 2020, when three nightclub employees acting as police lookouts were arrested. 
Goh sent multiple tip-off messages to the Night Owl chat group between January 2019 and April 2019. His messages include ""Cvs at gdm complex"", referring to police officers in civilian clothes at Golden Mile Complex, and ""open light"", referring to enforcement operations being carried out.
In another set of messages, he stated the licence plate numbers of police vehicles that were at the loading bay of Golden Mile Complex, indicating ""big ops around Beach Road and Jalan Besar"" and ""3 lay up the van"".
The prosecutor asked for a fine of S$10,000 for Goh, while his lawyer asked for a fine of between S$8,000 and S$10,000. The prosecutor referred to a line in the mitigation plea, where the defence said Goh voluntarily left the chat group in May 2019.
She said that investigations began in April 2019, so no weight should be given to him leaving the group a month later.
For Mervyn, he sent a message to the Rolex Movement group on Apr 10, 2019, saying: ""Geylang Lor 7 raid, 7 girls arrested.""
In a charge taken into consideration, he wrote to the same group: ""My contact informed me it’s CNB operation next 3 days island wide"".
His lawyer asked for a fine of S$6,000, saying that his client was not the mastermind of the chat group and that he had sent only two messages and not five, compared with the case where an accused person received a S$8,000 fine for five messages. 
 
For intentionally obstructing the course of justice, the men could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both."
Banks in Singapore lift fixed deposit rates further with latest round of promotions,"The interest rates offered by banks for 12-month fixed deposits are now at the highest in almost 24 years.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fixed-deposit-rates-banks-promotions-2991086,"SINGAPORE: Fixed deposit rates in Singapore have been on the rise, with some hitting levels unseen in almost 24 years, as banks keep up with their aggressive promotions.
UOB fired the first salvo on Monday (Oct 3) and since then, more lenders have announced their latest deals for the month of October.
For a 12-month fixed deposit, Maybank currently offers the highest rate at 3 per cent per annum. Other options from OCBC, UOB, RHB, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank range from 2.65 per cent to 2.9 per cent.
These rates are the highest in almost 24 years. The last time interest rates on 12-month deposits went above 3 per cent was in November 1998 when banks offered 3.11 per cent, according to data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Beyond 12 months, promotional rates for a 15-month duration are going at 3 per cent and 3.05 per cent at UOB and Maybank, respectively. For those who can park their cash for a slightly longer period, RHB is offering a return of up to 3.2 per cent for 24 months.
There are more choices for consumers looking at durations less than a year.
Lenders such as UOB, Maybank, RHB and HSBC offer varying tenors ranging from four to 10 months at returns as high as 2.9 per cent per annum.

These promotions, which are seeing rates being revised every month, come as global central banks go on a rate-hike race to combat soaring inflation.
“As the concern on inflation is pressing, the speed of increase (in interest rates) has been quick as well, hence you can observe how fast the banks are keeping up,” said Mr Tan Chin Yu, a senior client adviser at wealth advisory firm Providend.
While banks make swift adjustments to their borrowing rates, they also have to remain competitive in the space of deposits.
“Previously when interest rates globally were low, banks were lending out at low rates so they have no room to raise interest rates when it comes to fixed deposits … But now, they can raise rates to attract more depositors and bring in more funds,” Mr Tan added.
Foreign banks are usually more aggressive in the fight for deposits, as their smaller deposit bases mean they need to balance liquidity and cost of funding visibility in a rising rate environment. But in light of the competition, domestic banks also have to ramp up their game, experts said.
OCBC and UOB both said there is strong demand for their promotional rates.
OCBC said demand for its time deposits was 75 per cent higher on average in September and August, compared to the average placements in the preceding six months. Over at UOB, fixed deposit volume tripled in September versus the month before.
While its peers dangle juicy deals, DBS – Singapore’s largest lender – has thus far opted to raise its fixed deposit board rates.
It has made two rounds of revisions this year, with the latest being last month, a spokesperson said.
For example, balances between S$1,000 and S$9,999 now earn an interest of 1.4 per cent for a six-month period, up from 0.75 per cent about a month ago.
DBS also recently adjusted the tenors of new fixed deposit placements from eight months to up to 12 months, so as to “better cater to customer demand”.
The bank said its customers prefer to have fixed deposits pegged to board rates due to a “greater peace of mind” when these deposits reach maturity. 
“This is because they can roll over or renew their funds at competitive rates. This is in contrast with the promotional fixed deposit rates, which often come with conditions that are imposed on depositors,” the spokesperson said.

BEFORE TAKING UP A FIXED DEPOSIT
Amid the slew of fixed deposit options, what should a customer do?
In general, fixed deposits can be a useful way to earn some returns from cash set aside for short-term needs. These include instances when an individual requires “a very high level of safety and cannot afford to have market volatility over a short period of time”, Mr Tan said.
There are also no maximum limits for fixed deposits. This works well for those with more cash on hand, especially as some banks offer even higher rates for those with large amounts, said Mr Alfred Chia, chief executive officer of financial advisory firm SingCapital.
Meanwhile, most lenders here are part of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. Under this scheme, the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation will pay out up to S$75,000 per depositor per institution if a member bank or finance company goes under.
That said, fixed deposits require funds to be parked with the bank for a set period. During which, depositors cannot withdraw their money – or they risk paying a penalty or losing the interests earned.
Hence, one will have to carefully consider the time horizon they have until the money is needed.
“You want to make sure that you match the assets towards the liability timeframe well,” said Mr Tan.
The latest bank promotions also come with various conditions, such as a minimum placement sum and a requirement for fresh funds. The latter is typically defined as new deposits from outside the bank.
UOB - one of the lenders with a fresh fund requirement - said the condition is “in line with industry practice”. The bank reiterated that the competitive fixed deposit rates it offers are an “attractive proposition"" for customers looking to hedge against inflation and market volatility.

Singapore Savings Bonds 10-year average return hits record high of 3.21%



















Beyond Singapore Savings Bonds and fixed deposits, what other low-risk investments are there?













Beyond fixed deposits, financial advisers say individuals can also consider other low-risk alternatives such as the Singapore Savings Bonds whose yields have hit record highs.
The latest tranche for November, which opened for applications on Monday, is offering a 10-year average return of 3.21 per cent, a record high since the bond was first launched in 2015. The first-year interest rate of 3.08 per cent is also the highest ever.
Given this, Mr Chia described the Singapore Savings Bonds, which are issued and fully backed by the Singapore Government, as “more superior” than fixed deposits.
Investors are also free to withdraw or redeem the savings bond at any time, even though the product is issued with a 10-year maturity term. There are no penalties involved and accrued interest will not be forfeited, he noted.
But given how the record-high yield is likely to attract more demand, investors may not be able to get the full amount they applied for, Mr Chia added.
Another alternative will be Treasury bills (T-bills) which are short-term debt securities issued and backed by the Singapore Government.
For example, the latest six-month T-bill gave a yield of 3.32 per cent – the highest this year and up from 0.48 per cent in January.
Given how banks typically offer higher interest rates to depositors who commit to leaving their money in their accounts for longer, Mr Chia said T-bills serve as a “better choice” with their higher rate of return over a shorter timeframe.
“This is definitely a better choice for those who think that interest rates are going to go up and they don’t want to park their money in something for too long.”"

Instant noodles recalled over presence of pesticide: SFA,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mie-sedaap-spicy-instant-noodles-recalled-presence-pesticide-2990916,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Thursday (Oct 6) issued a recall for two products under the Mie Sedaap instant noodles brand after detecting ethylene oxide, a pesticide, in the food products.
SFA has directed Sheng Sheng F&B Industries to recall Mie Sedaap Korean Spicy Soup instant noodles and Mie Sedaap Korean Spicy Chicken instant noodles. The recall is ongoing.
The recall affects the Mie Sedaap Korean Spicy Soup instant noodles with an expiry date of Mar 17, 2023, and the Mie Sedaap Korean Spicy Chicken instant noodles with an expiry date of May 21, 2023. Both come from Indonesia.  
""Ethylene oxide is a pesticide that is not authorised for use in food,"" SFA said in a news release. 
""Under the Singapore Food Regulations, ethylene oxide is allowed to be used in the sterilisation of spices. The Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of ethylene oxide in spices should not exceed 50mg/kg.""
Following the detection of ethylene oxide in Haagen-Dazs ice cream products in Aug 2022, SFA has been looking into other food products, including instant noodles, for the presence of ethylene oxide. 
The agency said it did not detect ethylene oxide in any of the food products surveyed other than Mie Sedaap instant noodles. 
SFA is continuing regulatory testing of other Mie Sedaap instant noodle products.
It is also working with importers and Indonesian authorities to investigate and rectify the cause of ethylene oxide contamination. 
Should ethylene oxide be detected beyond the stipulated maximum levels, the agency will initiate recalls of the affected products as a precautionary measure, SFA added.

""Although there is no immediate risk to consumption of food contaminated with low levels of ethylene oxide, long term exposure may lead to health issues,"" said SFA in a media release. 
The agency added that exposure to ethylene oxide ""should be minimised as much as possible"". 
Consumers who have purchased the implicated products are advised not to consume them.
Those who have consumed the affected products and have concerns about their health should seek medical advice, said the agency. 
Consumers may also contact their point of purchase for enquiries.

"Teenager admits sexual offences against his aunt, cousin and underage girls",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teenager-admits-sexual-offences-against-aunt-cousin-underage-girls-pregnant-2990951,"SINGAPORE: A teenager admitted in court on Thursday (Oct 6) to various sexual offences against his aunt, cousin and two other underage girls since 2018 .
The 19-year-old was not named in court documents to protect the identity of the victims. He pleaded guilty to four charges including sexual penetration of a minor, molestation and voyeurism, with several other charges taken into consideration for sentencing.
The court heard that the accused was 15 in 2018 when he committed the offence against his maternal aunt, who was younger than him. She was eight at the time.
On the day of the offence, they were at a provision shop near his home when he decided to take her to a staircase landing to molest her and force her to perform a sex act on him.
That same year, the accused's cousin stayed with him on weekends as her parents were undergoing a divorce. The cousin was between seven and eight years old.
One night, when the accused was sleeping next to the cousin, he used criminal force on her to outrage her modesty.
The accused then racked up other sexual offences. He was charged in court in August 2020 for another sexual offence against a 15-year-old girl.
One of the conditions of his bail was not to contact his victims.
Despite his bail conditions, the accused met the girl in March 2021. They went to a staircase landing where they had ""consensual sex"", the prosecutor said.
A month later, the girl missed her period and bought a pregnancy test kit. She tested positive and told the accused about this. Her school lodged a police report in June 2021, saying she was pregnant. Court documents did not specify who the father was.
The accused went on to commit voyeurism against a stranger at Braddell MRT Station on Nov 25, 2021.
The 16-year-old girl was on her way to school when the accused stood close behind her on an escalator. He used his phone to look up her skirt.
But the girl saw him close to her and turned around to see his phone face-up on his outstretched palm. She also noticed movement on the screen. 
Seeing that she had turned around, the accused asked her for directions to a block in Toa Payoh.
The judge called for both probation and reformative training suitability reports for the accused and remanded him.
He will return to court for sentencing later this month."
Man jailed for assaulting fellow construction worker who took his safety harness ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-assaulting-fellow-construction-worker-who-took-his-safety-harness-cai-ling-hui-court-2991076,"SINGAPORE: Angered that his colleague had taken his safety harness, a construction worker assaulted him after an argument ensued, leaving him with grievous fractures.
Cai Linghui, 43, was sentenced to a year's jail on Thursday (Oct 6). He pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, with a second charge taken into consideration.
The court heard that Cai and the 33-year-old victim worked at the same construction site of a church in Choa Chu Kang.
At around 1pm on Jun 3, the victim came across Cai's safety harness that had been left unattended. He put it on and continued working, but Cai spotted him wearing it.
Cai told him that the harness was his and that he wanted it back, but the victim asked him to wait. They began arguing and Cai pulled the harness downwards, causing the victim to lose his footing and fall from the scaffolding he was standing on.
As the victim fell, he accidentally and lightly kicked Cai on his chest, said the prosecutor.
The victim landed on the ground, still tethered to the scaffolding by his harness.
Cai began punching the victim, who retaliated by returning the punch. Cai picked up a steel pipe and began assaulting the victim's head with it, causing his helmet to come off.
He then punched the victim repeatedly in the face until other workers stopped him. The punches were caught on camera.
The victim was taken to hospital with injuries including multiple facial fractures and abrasions over his head, chest and shin. His vision was blurry and he was given follow-ups with ophthalmology and plastic surgery specialists. He was reviewed in July with no significant cosmetic or functional defects other than a nasal obstruction.
The prosecutor asked for 13 to 14 months' jail, noting the seriousness of the injuries caused. She accepted that the victim retaliated - although only to a small degree - and that the accused's guilty plea indicated remorse.
However, she pointed out the charge taken into consideration, where Cai struck the victim with a metal pole. She added that Cai had also endangered the victim's safety by pulling him off the scaffolding.
Cai was remanded and had no lawyer. He said he did not think the victim's injuries were that serious as he heard he had gone back to work, but this argument was rebuffed by the judge, who got the interpreter to read out to him again the list of injuries caused.
For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Cai could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned."
No further action against MP Louis Ng for holding placard without permit in support of hawkers: AGC,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-mp-louis-ng-no-further-action-police-public-order-act-agc-2990891,"SINGAPORE: No further action will be taken by the police against MP Louis Ng under the Public Order Act for holding up a sign in support of hawkers more than two years ago, said the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) in a statement on Thursday (Oct 6).
""Investigations have revealed that Mr Ng was exercising his duty as a Member of Parliament, in expressing care and support for the welfare of the hawkers in his constituency during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said an AGC spokesperson.
The statement added that police investigations have been completed.
The AGC also highlighted that Mr Ng's case is different from that of activist Jolovan Wham, who was charged and convicted of taking part in an assembly in a prohibited area. He had held up a sign that read ""Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa"" outside the State Courts in December 2018.
An AGC spokesperson said: ""Mr Jolovan Wham was charged and convicted because he was demonstrating in a prohibited area (the State Courts entrance). This is an offence under s 15(2) of the POA (Public Order Act). Mr Wham did not offer any defence to the Charge. The facts of the case involving Mr Jolovan Wham are different from the case involving Mr Louis Ng.""
WHAT LOUIS NG DID
Mr Ng made a Facebook post about his trip to Yishun Park Hawker Centre on Jun 20, 2020, and asked Singaporeans to support hawkers as they ""worked hard during the past few months to try to make ends meet and to provide yummy food for us. More than ever, our hawker heroes need our support.”
The post included five photos of Mr Ng with hawkers, in which he could be seen holding up a sign with the words ""Support Them"".
The police then conducted an investigation on March 3, 2021, as there was a possible offence of public assembly without a permit by Mr Ng.
In response, Mr Ng wrote on Facebook on the same day, stating that he was on his regular walkabout and wanted to urge residents to support the hawkers.
""I was there to make sure our hawkers were doing okay. As we all know, they suffered badly during the circuit breaker,"" he said. ""I also wanted to urge our residents to support our hawkers and held a sign indicating this and took photos together with the hawkers.""
Mr Ng was also asked by the police to provide a statement, and had done so."
Toilet voyeur caught in the act by victim's colleague gets jail,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/voyeur-toilet-caught-act-jail-16-weeks-2990906,"SINGAPORE: A voyeur who was caught in the act of recording a woman in the toilet was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail on Thursday (Oct 6).
Mohammad Nabeel Harith Zulkifli, 31, pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism, with another three charges taken into consideration.
His lawyer tried to argue for a lower jail term for him, pointing to the steps he has taken to rehabilitate himself. These include surrendering his phone passwords to his parents, creating a Google spreadsheet for his family and friends to note his whereabouts and never going to the toilet alone.
The court heard that Nabeel had gone to a women's toilet in a location not specified in court documents at about 2pm on Feb 8, 2021.
He went there as he ""wished to satisfy his impulse of observing females relieving themselves in the toilet"", said the prosecutor.
After waiting outside the toilet for about half an hour, Nabeel saw a 30-year-old woman entering a cubicle. He followed her in and squatted outside her cubicle, before extending his phone through the gap in the cubicle door to record her relieving herself.
The victim's 40-year-old colleague entered the toilet soon after and saw Nabeel taking a video of the victim. She shouted at him and asked him what he was doing, and Nabeel fled the scene.
The colleague called the police, and Nabeel was arrested at his home several days later. Devices seized from him contained a video of a second unknown victim relieving herself in a toilet. 
The prosecutor sought 16 weeks' jail for Nabeel, saying these are serious offences committed in public toilets and that members of the public are entitled to use the toilets without fear. 
Nabeel's lawyer asked for a lower jail term, saying her client has since taken several steps to improve himself. She said he has sought psychiatric treatment since 2017 but has since ""been forced to face the reality"" and to do more as the treatment was ""not enough"".
Nabeel has carried out research himself and learnt about cognitive behavioural therapy, suggesting it to his psychiatrist, she said.
He has also been working ""intensely"" as a Grab delivery rider to fund his therapy sessions, and removed his passwords from his phones so his parents can check his phone. He has also activated parental control on his devices and no longer owns a laptop, said his lawyer.
Nabeel also initially set up a Google Sheet on which he logged his whereabouts and made it accessible to his parents and friends, but stopped as this took quite some effort.
He also makes sure he is accompanied when he goes to public restrooms, said his lawyer.
The prosecutor acknowledged Nabeel's efforts at rehabilitation, but said he must still serve his punishment.
For each charge of voyeurism, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments."
Man charged with taking 34kg of rhino horns into Singapore from South Africa,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-charged-taking-34kg-rhino-horns-singapore-south-africa-gumede-sthembiso-joel-2990846,"SINGAPORE: A man was charged on Thursday (Oct 6) with taking 34.25kg of African rhino horns into Singapore while on the way to Laos.
South African Gumede Sthembiso Joel, 32, was handed one charge under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act of taking the horns from Johannesburg, South Africa, into Singapore without a valid export or re-export permit, licence, certificate or written permission by a South African authority.
Gumede allegedly took the horns with him from Johannesburg and was in transit in Singapore on the way to Vientiane, Laos at about noon on Oct 4 this year.
On Thursday, Gumede said he had no lawyer at the moment and was ""pleading innocent"". He said he was unsure if he could raise bail.
The prosecutor said they would inform Gumede's embassy of the case. He was offered bail of S$40,000 and will return to court on Oct 27.
According to a previous statement by the National Parks Board (NParks), airport security and NParks' K9 unit detected and inspected two bags at Changi Airport. They found 34kg of rhino horns, estimated to be worth around S$1.2 million.
This is Singapore's largest seizure of rhinoceros horns to date, said NParks.
If convicted, Gumede can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$50,000, or both."
CNA Explains: Should you stop using regular salt? What are lower-sodium alternatives?,"Is that pricey Himalayan pink salt you bought better for you than regular salt? What about MSG – is it really that bad? CNA speaks to nutritionists to find out.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/what-lower-sodium-salt-msg-himalayan-pink-salt-sea-salt-2983936,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Government is encouraging people to switch from regular salt to lower-sodium alternatives, amid health concerns due to rising sodium intake.
Singapore residents consume almost double the recommended daily limit of sodium, and this consumption is growing as people eat out more often, said the Health Promotion Board (HPB) last week.
What is a lower-sodium salt alternative and how does it compare to regular salt? Should you consider making the switch? CNA asks some nutritionists. 
First, why do we need to cut back on sodium?
People in Singapore consume an average of 3,600mg of sodium, or more than one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt, a day. This is almost double that of the World Health Organization’s recommended daily limit of less than 2,000mg of sodium.
And more than one in three Singaporeans have hypertension, an increase from one in four in 2017, according to the National Population Health Survey in 2020. 
This is a major factor for cardiovascular disease and strokes, and the upward trend applies to all subgroups of age, gender and ethnicity. 
HPB aims to reduce Singapore’s sodium intake by about 15 per cent over the next five years, shaving off a quarter teaspoon of salt per person per day. 
About 75 per cent of Singapore residents’ sodium intake comes from added salt, which refers to salt, sauces or seasoning added to meals. The remaining 25 per cent is “hidden” sodium in processed food. 
Many foods that people consume contain substantial amounts of sodium, though this may not always be obvious as salt as they are added not just for flavour but also as a preservative, said Ms Carolyn Stephen, a senior nutritionist with Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre. 
These include enriched or fortified bread, breakfast cereals, instant noodles, processed meats or foods like fishballs and fishcakes, said nutritionists CNA spoke to. 
There are also substantial amounts of salt in common local dishes like chicken rice, bottled or canned sauces, pastes and dressings, pickled vegetables and snacks like chips and nuts. 
What is in lower-sodium salt alternatives? Why are they healthier? 
Regular salt is made up of 100 per cent sodium chloride, and typically contains 2,000mg of sodium per teaspoon. 
Lower-sodium salt alternatives are products where sodium chloride is replaced by alternatives such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride or potassium chloride, which is more commonly used in products like K-salt, said Ms Stephen. 
These alternatives have 30 per cent less sodium content “without compromising taste”, and also contribute potassium to your diet, she noted. 
“Potassium is known to help regulate blood pressure and so potassium salts do not carry the same risk for cardiovascular diseases like sodium-based salts,” said Ms Stephen. 
Sodium and potassium work in tandem in the human body to regulate blood pressure, said Dr Kalpana Bhaskaran, deputy director of the glycemic index research unit at Temasek Polytechnic’s School of Applied Science. 
High sodium concentration in blood promotes water retention, raises blood pressure and strains the blood vessel walls. Arterial walls thicken to cope with the strain, narrowing the space inside the arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Potassium, which is found naturally in spinach, broccoli and bananas, helps to ease tension in blood vessel walls, which in turn helps to lower blood pressure.
Lower-sodium salt alternatives with potassium create a similar or slightly lower level of saltiness compared to regular salt, said Ms Stephen.
However, in high amounts, they can taste bitter or metallic, which can be solved by blending potassium and sodium salts along with other flavour-enhancing agents to maintain appeal, she added. 
Although lower-sodium salts offer “double benefits” to health, people with kidney-related diseases should seek medical advice when incorporating this into their diets, said Ms Stephen. 
“Nonetheless, lower-sodium salt alternatives still contribute sodium and must still be used in moderation.”

What about other natural salts? Are they also healthier? 
Some shoppers may opt for popular natural salts like Himalayan pink salt, kosher salt or sea salt, thinking that there are health benefits. 
In reality, these salts do not offer any significant nutritional benefits compared to table salt even though they are more expensive, said Dr Bhaskaran, who is also the president of the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association. 
Himalayan pink salt contains more potassium compared to table salt. Kosher salt is similar to table salt and does not contain any trace minerals, iodine or anticaking agents, she added. 
“But there is no significant difference in the sodium content between these varieties,” said Dr Bhaskaran. 
Natural salts are different from regular salt mainly in their texture and the way they are processed, said Ms Stephen. 
Regular salts are typically granulated, refined to remove other minerals and sometimes iodised. Natural salts are “processed minimally”, leaving most of the trace materials such as magnesium, potassium and calcium intact, she added. 
“However, the presence of these minerals are so minute and do not add much nutritional value,” said Ms Stephen. 
“It is better to obtain these minerals from other healthy foods for more tangible health benefits.” 
Both natural and regular salts contain the same amount of sodium - about 40 per cent, which yields about 2,000mg of sodium per teaspoon.
This means that both have the same potential to impact blood pressure and cause cardiovascular diseases, Ms Stephen said. 
What about MSG? Isn’t it bad for me?
For years, MSG has been viewed as unhealthy as a small percentage of the population reported that they had symptoms like headaches and increased thirst after consuming food at Chinese restaurants, said Dr Bhaskharan. 
However, newer research has questioned the accuracy of its supposed adverse effects on health, she said. 
MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is a flavour enhancer derived from L-glutamic acid, which is naturally found in foods like tomatoes, mushrooms and onions, nutritionists said. 
It also can be artificially made via fermentation using corn or sugar beets. 
MSG is a non-essential amino acid, which means that our body can produce it and doesn’t need to get it from food, said Dr Bhaskharan. 
It contains about 12 per cent sodium, which is lower than regular salt. 
Even though it has less sodium, it can enhance salt perception, and the flavour of food by adding umami, which is a taste that helps to intensify the meaty, savoury flavour, said Ms Stephen. 
This means that just a small amount is needed to elevate the overall flavour of healthier foods with lower sodium content, she added. 
Research has also shown that MSG can be used as a suitable replacement for some salt in packaged foods like snacks and soups, which can help to reduce their sodium content by 30 to 50 per cent. 
“This provides good potential to use MSG to formulate healthier, ‘better-for-you’ food products without compromising on taste. This in turn can propel consumers to choose more nutritious food options and positively impact health,” Ms Stephen said. 
If I use less salt or switch to lower-sodium alternatives, how can I still make sure my food is tasty? 
It is feasible to replace regular salt with lower-sodium salt, and reduce sodium intake significantly without compromising taste, said Dr Bhaskaran. 
“This ‘stealth’ approach of salt substitution has no significant impact to taste and is recognised as arguably the best current strategy to reduce sodium intake and blood pressure at the population level,” she added. 
Studies have shown that after consuming a diet with a 30 to 50 per cent overall reduction in sodium content for two to three months, people gradually developed a preference for foods with lower salt level, said Dr Bhaskaran. 
“It is a matter of time to accept the lower salt taste compared to what they have been consuming earlier.” 
It is possible to gradually adjust your palate to lower-salt foods, said Ms Stephen. 
It takes two to three weeks for taste receptors in the tongue to become more sensitive to salt and get accustomed to less salty food without perceiving it as bland, she added. 
In cooking, fresh herbs and spices, citrus, mustard and vinegar can be used to enhance flavour. Onion, garlic, ginger and spices like turmeric, pepper and chilli can also accentuate the taste and aroma to make food more enjoyable without the need for more salt, said Ms Stephen. 
Salt-free ingredients with distinctive flavour profiles also help to add unique flavours to the dish. These include mushrooms, kelp, sesame oil, bonito flakes and nutritional yeast, she added. 
When shopping for ingredients, nutritionists urged home chefs to shop for healthier alternatives and go fresh as much as possible. 
Foods like fresh poultry, meat and fish contain negligible amounts of sodium, and fresh fruits and vegetables contain potassium, which can help maintain lower blood pressure and better heart health. 
When buying processed foods like canned food, smoked or pickled food, instant products and convenience meals, as well as sauces and condiments, choose the healthier versions, said Ms Stephen. 
For example, look out for the Healthier Choice symbol, or opt for the ""low in sodium"" or ""reduced sodium"" options. 
Reading nutrition labels can help one to make clearer choices when comparing food products based on their sodium content, she added. 
You can also avoid sodium when eating out. For instance, you can ask for less gravy or less salt and sauces when you order items like fried rice, stir-fried vegetables or pasta, said Dr Bhaskharan. 
Those who are looking to cut down on sodium should also avoid adding extra sauces or salt at the table. They can also choose fresh ingredients when ordering dishes like yong tau foo or mala xiang guo."
Prices of natural gas provided under long-term contracts have risen by up to 50%: Gan Kim Yong,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lng-piped-natural-gas-prices-gan-kim-yong-parliament-2989606,"SINGAPORE: Prices of piped natural gas (PNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) provided under long-term contracts have risen over the past year, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday (Oct 5).
PNG prices were up 20 per cent year-on-year in August, while LNG prices were up 50 per cent compared to the same month last year, Mr Gan said in a written answer to a parliamentary question.
Member of Parliament Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang) had asked Mr Gan about the proportions of PNG and LNG used by Singapore to generate its electricity, and about the year-to-date price changes for these commodities.
""Domestically, around 95 per cent of our electricity is generated using natural gas. For 2021, around two-thirds of our natural gas is imported as term piped natural gas, while the remaining one-third is imported as term liquefied natural gas,"" Mr Gan said.
""Our electricity generation companies also use spot LNG to supplement their long-term contracts.""
Between January and August this year, prices of PNG and LNG provided through term contracts rose by around 21 per cent and 38 per cent respectively, Mr Gan added.
During the same time frame, spot LNG prices surged by 113 per cent.
On a year-on-year basis, spot LNG prices were up 224 per cent in August compared to the same month in 2021.
""As Singapore imports most of our energy supply for electricity production, the increase in global energy prices over the past year will flow through into our prices,"" Mr Gan said.

CNA Explains: How the Russia-Ukraine war drove up LNG prices and what this means for Singapore



















Lower electricity tariffs from October to December after 6 consecutive hikes













Speaking to CNA last month, analysts said that Singapore's demand for both PNG and LNG is generally fulfilled through long-term contracts.
Electricity prices in Singapore should therefore be somewhat protected from volatility, as spot LNG prices - or the market rate for the near-term delivery of the commodity - are significantly higher than the prices of LNG supplied under long-term contracts.
Global energy markets have been impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and as winter approaches with Russian gas supplies restricted for ""unfriendly"" countries, a scramble is under way in Europe to secure more LNG.
Concluding his answer, Mr Gan acknowledged concerns about the energy crunch.
""Countries around the world are struggling with rising energy prices, especially as winter approaches. I know that many Singaporeans are also concerned about whether something similar might happen to us,"" he said.
""Our approach has always been to right-price electricity and provide targeted assistance, such as GST Voucher - U-Save rebates to consumers, especially to the vulnerable and low-income ones.
""The Energy Market Authority is also prepared to introduce more emergency measures to forestall extreme volatility in electricity prices if necessary.""
Last week, it was announced that electricity tariffs in Singapore would dip during the October to December period after six consecutive quarters of increase."
Singapore women’s football league kicks off expansion after record prize money,"The league is adding two more teams to its upcoming season as it seeks to elevate players’ standards and build on growing global interest in women’s football.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/football-womens-premier-league-singapore-sponsor-deloitte-2988596,"SINGAPORE: When she was eight years old, striker Nur Izzati Rosni tagged along with her brothers to play football as the only girl in their all-boys games.
This year, at age 22, Izzati was the top scorer in the Singapore Women's Premier League (WPL) following a historic season that saw her team, champions Lion City Sailors FC, receive the largest prize money in the league's history.
The nation’s top-flight women’s football league clinched its first title sponsorship this year since its launch in 2000, with a prize money of S$25,000 for the champions – five times more than last season’s.
The title sponsor, consulting firm Deloitte, will boost the local women’s football scene with more than S$300,000 in a three-year deal.
“With the boom we're seeing in women's football worldwide in the last couple of years, and with a golden generation of young female footballers coming through Singapore, we felt that it was time for us to get behind this,” said Mr James Walton, Deloitte Southeast Asia’s sports business group leader.
“Sometime around the last World Cup, we've really hit a tipping point in women's football and from here, the only way is up.”
The league said it is adding two more teams to its upcoming season – bringing the total number of teams to nine – as it seeks to elevate players’ standards and build on growing global interest in women’s football.

RAISING STANDARDS, ADDING BUZZ
Securing sponsors like Deloitte will raise the standards for the sport as funding will be pumped into training, facilities, medical, sport science and even remuneration, said Mr Chew Chun-Liang, chief executive officer of Lion City Sailors FC.  
Deloitte’s presence has already made a significant difference in the season that just passed, players said, with matches live streamed on YouTube, scores updated live, as well as a place to call home – Yishun stadium.
“We’ve never had our matches on live stream, our scores didn’t use to be live, nobody updated our tournament or league. This (sponsorship) creates awareness for people who don’t know that there’s a women’s league in Singapore,” said Izzati.
“It feels like we’re professionals, just like the guys’ teams.”
Players hope that bringing more sponsors on board can lighten the load on the athletes, most of whom need to manage the sport with work or school.
“It’s really tiring just to perform well,” said Izzati, who has been juggling homework and football since her secondary school days. “I hope that we can become professionals so we can ease off that burden and just focus on football, which we’re really passionate about and willing to give our all (to).""
Women football players in Singapore get little financial remuneration – typically only for travel allowance – compared to professional players in the men’s league, said Mr Walton.
Clubs and coaches hope that having sponsors can help to create more buzz in the media and bring in more fans.
“Running a league is not easy – you need resources and financial support,” said Mr Chew. “Having more sponsors will help to elevate the standard of football in many aspects, including creating awareness on social media, broadcast, bringing the fans and creating the hype.”
WOMEN’S FOOTBALL GAINING MOMENTUM
Internationally, women’s football is gradually attracting more fans, with some leagues in Europe boasting record viewers this year.  
The local scene is seeing similar trends. There is a growing fan base and ticketed events have attracted substantial crowds, Ms Julie Teo, chairperson of the women's committee at the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), told CNA.
“We've seen an increase in interest as things open up after COVID-19. We were able to host games again, and international matches. And for the first time, we had ticketed events with a good sizeable crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 spectators,” she said.
With the women’s league set to expand, fans can expect more matches, multiple venues and the possibility of attracting foreign players.
Mr Walton said he hopes more women will take up football, as the sport presents a host of opportunities such as education scholarships to universities.
“If you want to get involved in a sport where there will be opportunities and investment, then football is definitely a way to go,” he said.
“It's often not seen as a sport for women, but if you come down and just watch a game in the WPL, watch the Singapore national team play, you'll see that it really is a game for both men and women.”

Ex-CEO of Prive Group gets jail for punching boy after judge overturns mandatory treatment order,"A High Court judge sentenced Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han to two weeks in jail after an appeal by the prosecution. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-prive-group-ceo-jean-luc-kha-vu-han-jail-appeal-mandatory-treatment-order-2989096,"SINGAPORE: The former CEO of food and beverage company The Prive Group was on Wednesday (Oct 5) sentenced to two weeks in jail and a fine of S$3,500 for assaulting a teenage boy, after the High Court overturned his mandatory treatment order.
Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han, a French national, was initially handed a 12-month mandatory treatment order by a district judge in March, on account of his mental condition. Under the order, an offender will undergo psychiatric treatment in lieu of jail time. 
But the prosecution appealed and High Court judge Vincent Hoong found that the sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution outweighed that of rehabilitation in his case. 
Vu Han admitted last year to punching a 13-year-old boy on his temple and asking him lewd questions in a lift at a shopping mall in 2019. He was intoxicated at the time.
A psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health found that Vu Han had been suffering from bipolar disorder and had likely been having a manic episode with the possibility of psychosis at the time of the offence. 
The psychiatrist found a ""contributory link"" between Vu Han's condition and his offending behaviour.

Mandatory treatment order report called for ex-Prive Group CEO who punched 13-year-old boy













However, the prosecution appealed, arguing that the decision to impose a mandatory treatment order was wrong partly because Vu Han's psychiatric condition did not sufficiently reduce his culpability to justify such an order.
The prosecution's position was that the psychiatrist's assessment was both retrospective and premised on inaccurate facts. 
It also argued that the principles of deterrence and retribution outweighed rehabilitation as Vu Han had carried out an unprovoked assault on a young victim, leaving him with psychological and physical scars.
Agreeing with the prosecution, Justice Hoong said in his oral judgment: ""In combination with the numerous aggravating factors disclosed in the present case, I find that deterrence eclipses rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration.
""I consider (Vu Han's) voluntary intoxication and the fact that he had committed the offences against a vulnerable victim who suffered psychological scars to be aggravating.""
The judge noted that Vu Han's previous suitability report for mandatory treatment order did not offer adequate insight into the extent to which his offences were attributable to his bipolar disorder, as opposed to his intoxicated state. 
The judge also rejected defence lawyer Teh Ee-Von's argument that mandatory treatment orders had been meted out to offenders who inflicted more serious injuries to victims. 
""Even as the court should maintain a coherent approach to sentencing mentally disordered offenders, it must be alive to the fact that even the same type of mental disorder may afflict different persons to varying degrees and in diverse circumstances,"" said the judge.
In the same vein, he rejected Ms Teh's submission that a fine be imposed for the charge of causing hurt, based on similar past cases. 
However, Justice Hoong did not agree with the prosecution's proposed jail term as he felt that the harm suffered by the victim did not warrant eight weeks' jail. The judge also found that a fine of S$3,500 gave sufficient weight to the sexual nature of Vu Han's insulting remarks. 
""In closing, I make a few observations. The reality is that no two cases of mentally disordered offenders are identical. The present case should not be misconstrued as casting doubt on the veracity or potential severity of bipolar disorder,"" said Justice Hoong. 
""Nor does it set forth a general principle that the court will invariably view claims by offenders that they committed offences while labouring under mental disorders with circumspection. Each case turns on its own facts."""
MPs unanimously endorse White Paper on Singapore's healthcare reform plan,"The two-day debate on the country's new strategy, which will put a stronger focus on preventive care, saw more than 30 Members of Parliament rising to speak on the issue.

More than 30 Members of Parliament from both sides of the House rose to speak during the debate, where they shared suggestions on how to make healthcare more accessible to the public as well as anecdotes about their residents and their own family.
First announced during the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Committee of Supply debate in March, Healthier SG focuses heavily on preventive care and aims to have citizens take charge of their own healthcare, where they can enrol with a single doctor who will support them in their health needs throughout their lives.
The voluntary national healthcare programme will be open for enrolment to those aged 60 and above in the second half of 2023.
It will gradually be made available to those between 40 and 59 years old in the next two years.

Urging all stakeholders including employers, family doctors and the public to push for a healthier lifestyle, he said: ""All societies, at some point, will have to confront population ageing. It is an urgent and stern test, and some societies end up with bankrupted healthcare systems or let healthcare cripple their society and economy.
""We are determined to overcome this test,"" he said, adding that Singapore has the resources, ability, organisation and determination to do this.
TACKLING MANPOWER 
During the two-day debate, MPs raised a wide range of concerns including the transition to the Healthier SG strategy and manpower issues, which continues to plague the healthcare system. 
In his closing speech, Mr Ong noted that a certain narrative has been going around - that hospital staff are leaving because they are overworked, attrition rate is at a record high and people are avoiding the healthcare sector.
The expectation is that authorities must do campaigns, reduce workload and raise salaries to attract more people, he said. 
""There are some elements of truth in this narrative, such as how there is indeed a manpower crunch and hospital staff have been working very hard, especially during the pandemic,"" he said. 
""But the rest is less than fully factual, it propagates some negative energy and may not help us tackle the actual problems.""
He countered that the yearly intake of nursing students in ITE, polytechnics and universities has increased to 2,100, compared to about 1,500 nursing students a decade ago. 
""We are trying to increase it further, to 2,300 in the next couple of years. Our education institutions receive many more applications than there are places,"" he said, adding that Singapore is attracting 4 per cent of the student cohort into nursing. 
""For every 20 local students you see in class, one would be trained to become a nurse and they are applying. So, healthcare has a very fair share of the local talent pool, considering that there are so many sectors vying for local talent,"" he said.

Turning to attrition rates, he said that there has been no mass exodus of local nurses, adding that the record high attrition rate is for foreign nurses, which rose from its usual 8.9 per cent to 14.8 per cent last year. 
This was mainly due to the pandemic, which has increased the demand for nurses all over the world, he said, adding that Singapore's foreign nurses are being poached by other countries including New Zealand and the UK.
Faced with an ageing population and a limited pool of new local talents due to Singapore's shrinking young population, Mr Ong stressed the need to hold on to foreign nurses in the face of heightened international competition.
""If we are honest with ourselves, we know the numbers simply will not add up if we only rely on local manpower, no matter how hard we try to expand the pipeline,"" he said.
""Therefore, if we want to take care of our seniors and the sick, if we want to reduce the workload of healthcare workers, we must expect foreign healthcare workers to play a bigger role in the coming years.""
While the ""great majority"" of the nursing workforce will still be locals, the number and role of foreign nurses will need to grow, he added. 
GUARDING AGAINST ABUSE OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS
During his speech, Mr Ong also delivered a personal message to healthcare workers, to express appreciation and respect for their hard work and sacrifices. 
Pointing out that many healthcare workers have faced abuse by patients and family members who lashed out at them, he said that this cannot and should not go unaddressed. He added that MOH hopes to raise public awareness on abusive behaviour that should be stopped, and equip healthcare workers to better handle such situations.  
""I believe the great majority of Singaporeans respect and appreciate our healthcare workers,"" he said. 
""I hope that our healthcare workers will look past a small minority that show disrespect, and have faith that the great majority salute you, which includes everyone in MOH.
""And I believe I speak for every member of this House, and we too respect them and their work, whether they are men or women, young or old, local or foreign.""
CAPITATION-BASED FUNDING 
Several members including MP Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied) also sought clarification on the new model of funding for healthcare clusters under Healthier SG.
Currently, Singapore funds its three healthcare clusters largely based on their workload such as the number of treatments and operations. 
But under the new strategy, it will move towards capitation funding - which will see clusters getting a fixed fee for every person living in the area under their charge, taking into consideration the different risk profiles of patients.
This is to provide the clusters with a fresh incentive to keep residents healthy through preventive care and save some of the funding.
While she noted the benefits of capitation funding, Ms Lim raised concerns that it could also lead to healthcare providers ""cherry-picking"" their patients. 
""With a fixed annual servicing fee, it might make economic sense to choose healthier patients, rather than, for instance, older patients with health problems,"" said Ms Lim.
Responding to these concerns, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said the annual service fee will have a base rate that will differ for enrolled patients with and without chronic conditions. 
This is regardless of whether the enrollees, the residents, are compliant with the health plans, said Dr Puthucheary.
On top of this, additional payouts will be provided upon the completion of critical care components recommended in the GPs' care protocols and the residents' health plan. 
Dr Puthucheary said - for a start - this means that doctors will be paid not on the basis of whether their patients' blood pressure or blood sugar levels have come down but rather, whether they engaged with the interventions that would help to bring down the blood pressure and blood sugar.
He added that this will help to minimise the impact of cherry-picking as GPs had shared that educating and encouraging patients to turn up for screening requires dedicated time and effort.
Meanwhile, Mr Ong reassured that the shift to capitation funding is being done step-by-step and carefully.
While clusters have already been shifted to a capitation-based funding model, this has not been implemented for hospitals, polyclinics and community hospitals yet, he said. 
 ""Capitation funding is a direction we want to move towards. But this is a big change, and we will have to study and plan each move carefully, make sure every partner is ready,"" he said.
""When it happens, it must be accompanied by significant granting of autonomy, so that healthcare institutions can make the right siting decisions."" 
TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE
Responding to questions about the role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the new healthcare strategy, Mr Ong said this is still being worked out.
Earlier, during his speech, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (WP-Aljunied) had suggested extending the use of Medisave for more TCM procedures and alternative therapies that have a proven role in the management of general health as well as prevention of chronic diseases.
He added that TCM practitioners can also be leveraged to achieve the country's vision of improving the health of the entire population, noting their significant footprint on local communities.
""MOH should tap on them to help share healthy living tips and preventive healthcare strategies and not just to our seniors,"" said Mr Singh. 
While authorities are still working out how TCM can better complement Healthier SG, Mr Ong shared that two ongoing workgroups are looking at issues such as enhancing TCM clinical training and improving career development.
Once completed, it can be a basis to explore how to involve TCM in support of Healthier SG, he said.
HELPING SENIORS
Second Minister for Health Masagos Zulkifli and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam also took turns to address MPs' concerns on engaging seniors and ensuring that those who are less IT-savvy will not be left out. 
Ms Rahayu said support will be provided for those who need help navigating the programmes such as through the eldercare centres and community centres.
Meanwhile, Mr Masagos said there are active ageing programmes in every neighbourhood, with door-to-door preventive health visits also being conducted for seniors.
He said that between 2012 and 2020, the Government added around 6,000 daycare places and 5,500 home care places to cater to seniors and that transport is provided to those who need it. 
Eldercare centres have also been collaborating with the Infocomm Media Development Authority to hold digital literacy workshops for seniors, with programmes aimed at helping them to learn how to use Healthy 365 and HealthHub.

Rhinoceros are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to which Singapore is a signatory.
Under CITES, international trade in rhinoceros horns is prohibited.
Singapore is committed to international efforts to curb illegal wildlife trade to ensure the long-term survival of these animals, said NParks.
""Genetic testing is being carried out at NParks' Centre for Wildlife Forensics to identify the rhinoceros species,"" it added.
""The horns will subsequently be destroyed to prevent them from re-entering the market, disrupting the global supply chain of illegally traded rhinoceros horns.""
Under Singapore’s Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, those who are found in possession of CITES-scheduled species in transit in Singapore without valid CITES permits face a fine of up to S$50,000 per scheduled species, not exceeding an aggregate of S$500,000, up to two years in prison, or both.
""Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance stance on the illegal trade of endangered wildlife species, and their parts and derivatives,"" NParks said.
""Our agencies collaborate closely in a multi-pronged approach, which includes working with our international partners, to maintain vigilance in regulating and enforcing against illegal wildlife trade.""

"COE premiums for motorcycles continue to rise, hitting new record of S$11,751","Premiums for other categories ended lower in the latest bidding exercise on Wednesday (Oct 5).
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coe-prices-premiums-motorcycles-rise-new-record-2988501,"SINGAPORE: Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for motorcycles continued to rise to a new high on Wednesday (Oct 5), while prices in other categories closed lower in the latest bidding exercise.
Premiums for motorcycles closed at S$11,751, breaking the previous record of $11,589 set in the earlier tender last month.
This marks the 10th successive bidding exercise where motorcycle premiums have risen. The upward trend started on May 19 when premiums rose by a dollar to S$9,490.
The largest price drop in the latest tender was in Category B for larger and more powerful cars. Premiums fell by about S$12,000 to S$95,856.
This is the first time in almost five months that Category B prices have fallen below S$100,000. Premiums breached the S$100,000 mark on Jun 8 and rose to a record S$113,000 on Sep 7.
For Category A cars, or those 1,600cc and below with horsepower not exceeding 130bhp, premiums closed at S$80,501 on Oct 5, down from S$84,000 in the last exercise.
For the Open category COEs, which can be used for any vehicle type but end up being used mainly for large cars, prices fell to S$105,001 from S$107,201.
COEs for commercial vehicles, which include goods vehicles and buses, fell to S$65,991 from S$67,001 in the previous bidding exercise.
A total of 2,363 bids were received, with a quota of 1,806 COEs available.
This is the fifth tender under the revised method for counting the quarterly COE quota, aimed at reducing volatility in supply. 
Under the adjusted counting method, the COE supply will be based on a rolling average of vehicle deregistrations over two quarters instead of one.

No plans to align polytechnic academic calendar with primary and secondary schools: Chan Chun Sing,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/polytechnic-academic-calendar-december-break-no-plans-align-primary-secondary-schools-2988261,"SINGAPORE: There are currently no plans to align the polytechnic academic calendar with that of primary and secondary schools, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing told Parliament on Wednesday (Oct 5).
""The polytechnic calendar also takes into consideration when students enrol into their courses,"" he said. ""There are, however, overlaps between the term breaks of our schools and polytechnics.""
Mr Chan was responding to a question by Member of Parliament Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar), who asked whether the ministry had plans to review the semester breaks for polytechnics and align them with primary and secondary schools.
Unlike the academic calendars of primary and secondary schools that broadly follow a calendar year, polytechnics usually start their academic year in April and end it in March the next year.
Polytechnics have long semester vacations in the months of September and October, as well as March and April, unlike the June and December school holidays for primary and secondary schools. However, polytechnics also have short term breaks in June and December.
But Dr Wan Rizal, an academic staff member at Republic Polytechnic, noted how students in continuing education and training (CET) programmes spend the month of December going for lessons.
CET programmes, some of which are offered in polytechnics, usually involve adult learners studying part-time for a higher diploma or professional certificate.
""This means that for us to encourage them to do a part-time diploma and have a work-life balance, this means sacrificing their December holidays and in the spirit of celebrating families and supporting (them), I think this is something that we are missing,"" Dr Wan Rizal said.
""Now the staff, of course, have to do the markings in December, which means they are usually affected. Of if they are teaching the CET students, like I do, we do not get the December holidays as a whole.""
Polytechnic full-time diploma students also take mid-semester tests in the first few weeks of December, although they then have a two-week break until the new year.

Dr Wan Rizal asked if the ministry would consider ""blocking off the December holidays completely"" to allow staff and students to recuperate and spend time with their families.
Mr Chan said short modular courses and workforce skills qualifications, like those in CET programmes, have a more flexible programme schedule and are not necessarily aligned to the academic calendars used in longer programmes.
""This better meets the needs of the adult learners who have to juggle both work and learning,"" he said.






      Dr Wan Rizal speaking in Parliament on Oct 4, 2022. 
    






Mr Chan detailed how the ministry determines when ""different parts of society"" should go for breaks, saying that primary schools, secondary schools and post-secondary schools will have different needs.
""I think it may also not necessarily be the best idea for all of us to say that all of them should take their breaks together and align it as such,"" he said.
""It is quite difficult for us to therefore have one model that fits everything. And I'm quite sure that even if we do align it, there will be other challenges as well.""
Mr Chan said the ministry has to consider the different learning needs of each population segment. For instance, he said institutes of higher learning - which includes polytechnics - have to consider when their students can go for internships.
""In fact, in more recent times, I have also urged our IHLs (institutes of higher learning) to move away from what we rigidly think of as a term time and break time,"" he said.
""Because that may not be necessarily the best way for us to fit the internship opportunities into the working environment that is required by the participating companies. Companies would like to have interns according to their business needs rather than just their academic calendar."""
Healthier SG: What you need to know about Singapore’s new healthcare reform plan,"The voluntary national primary care programme will be open for those aged 60 and above to enrol in the second half of 2023, before being made gradually available to those between 40 and 59 years old in the next two years.

Called Healthier SG, the new strategy focuses heavily on preventive care and aims to have citizens take charge of their own healthcare, where they can enrol with a single doctor who will support them in their health needs throughout their lives. 
It comes as Singapore tackles the challenges of an ageing population and the rising impact of chronic disease.
Those who choose to enrol in Healthier SG - a voluntary programme - will be able to schedule face-to-face onboarding health consultation, which will be paid for by the Government.

Mental health support, getting elderly on digital platform among MPs’ concerns about healthcare reform plan



















Free screenings for diabetes, hypertension and some cancers under Healthier SG initiative













During the debate on Healthier SG, which started on Tuesday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung spelt out the key features of the healthcare reform plan.
Here’s what you need to know:
ONE FAMILY DOCTOR
Healthier SG aims to have one family physician and one health plan for everyone.
Under the plan, each resident chooses the family doctor or clinic. From there, they can develop health plans with their doctors, who will continue to monitor their progress via follow-ups.
This will provide an overview of their health status, medical needs as well as health goals, followed by an action plan, such as lifestyle adjustments or weight management.
The hope is that this will help family doctors build strong relationships with their patients, playing a bigger role in preventive care.
The enrolment will commence in the second half of 2023, starting with residents aged 60 and above before being gradually made available to those between 40 and 59 years old.
Flexibility will be provided for residents to change their enrolled doctor if they need to do so, such as if they move house or find a more suitable doctor.
As for those who are enrolled with a doctor, they can also continue to visit other doctors, including specialists taking care of their chronic illnesses.
The Government will also take steps to manage enrolment demand at GP clinics and polyclinics, following concerns from some residents that they might get squeezed out if their regular doctor is very popular.
This includes working with the clinics to see who their regular patients are and conducting the enrolment exercise in stages to avoid overwhelming demand.
Mr Ong also encouraged people to enrol early so that they can choose their preferred clinics.
FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS
Once a resident enrols under Healthier SG, they will get free annual check-ups with their family doctor, nationally recommended health screenings, and vaccinations.
The screening include three common chronic conditions and some cancers.
They are: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia as well as breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer.
As for those with specific risk factors, they may be referred for further tests.
Complex screenings such as colonoscopies will continue to be heavily subsidised in hospitals but will not be free.
Immunisations include the influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for those aged 65 and above or have specific medical conditions.
USING MEDISAVE
Those using MediSave to pay for the treatment of chronic illnesses will no longer have to co-pay 15 per cent of the bill using cash.
Instead, they will be able to pay the full amount with MediSave.
Noting that most Government subsidy schemes require some co-payment from residents to reflect a ""sharing of responsibility"", Mr Ong said this further subsidy is justified as it will result in personal actions to make changes and lead a healthier life.
ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES
An additional subsidy tier will be added to the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for common chronic drugs and drug price limits.
This is to level the significant price difference of drugs between GP clinics and polyclinics, so that residents will be encouraged to stick with the family doctor of their choice. 
All enrolled Singaporean CHAS card holders, including Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation card holders, will be able to benefit from this. 
Mr Ong pointed out that the price will not be able to equalise ""down to the last cent"" as the basis of calculating subsidies at polyclinics and for CHAS are different.
However, the current difference in drug prices between polyclinics and private GP clinics will be ""substantively"" removed, he said. 
MORE COMMUNITY HEALTH-RELATED ACTIVITIES
Community partners such as the People's Association and Sport Singapore will also organise more health-related activities. This ranges from ball games and brisk walking to Zumba classes and community gardening.
Public infrastructure such as sports facilities, parks and park connectors are also being enhanced to support active lifestyles.
EARNING POINTS FOR HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
To encourage residents to adopt and sustain a healthy lifestyle, health points will be awarded for physical activity and making healthier food purchases. These can then be exchanged for rewards offered by participating merchants including supermarkets and shopping malls.
The Healthy 365 app, which is currently used for initiatives such as the National Steps Challenge and the Eat Drink Shop Healthy Challenge, will also be enhanced to include features such as tracking calorie intake.
It has also been made compatible with digital health apps such as Apple Health Kit, Fitbit, and Samsung Health, to make it more accessible to the public."
"Mosquitoes released under Project Wolbachia do not bite, but increased presence can be noticeable: MSE","After male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes are released in new areas, the National Environment Agency receives feedback from residents but they eventually grow accustomed to the programme, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.

Mr Baey was addressing feedback received by NEA after Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes were released in new areas, but said such feedback is temporary as residents become “accustomed to the programme”. 
NEA’s data shows that the population of the wild-type Aedes aegypti mosquito falls to “very low levels” after a few months of releases, decreasing by up to 98 per cent. Bites from these mosquitoes are also significantly reduced, added Mr Baey in Parliament.  
“This is evident in the reduction of dengue cases by up to 70 per cent observed in study sites with at least one year of releases,” he said. 
“However, as Wolbachia-Aedes technology does not affect other species of mosquitoes, residents may still experience some bites from such mosquitoes.”

CNA Explains: Singapore ramps up Wolbachia mosquito project. How does it work in the fight against dengue?













      How does Project Wolbachia work?
  

The idea is to release male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry the Wolbachia bacteria so that when they mate with the female Aedes aegypti in an urban environment, the resulting eggs do not hatch due to incompatible matching. 
""Regular releases of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes over time will thus eventually lead to a reduced urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and will reduce the potential spread of diseases such as dengue,"" NEA said in a factsheet in May.
The male mosquitoes do not bite and cannot transmit disease as they feed only on plant juices such as nectar to obtain the sugar they need for energy and survival. 
The males will die soon after release, most within a week. 
This method is known as the suppression strategy.

COMMUNICATION WITH RESIDENTS AT PROJECT WOLBACHIA SITES 
NEA regularly engages residents at Project Wolbachia study sites, said Mr Baey. 
Such communication and outreach activities are done prior to releases, and include door-to-door distribution of publicity materials, display of posters and banners at high footfall areas and sharing of information via traditional and social media platforms.
NEA also engages establishments such as childcare centres and schools within the release areas. 
In the meantime, “source reduction” remains the key strategy to controlling the population of all types of mosquitoes, added Mr Baey. 
Mosquito control measures include a regular practice of the Mozzie Wipeout B-L-O-C-K steps and the “Spray, Apply, Wear” actions to prevent mosquito bites.

The estates - Ulu Pandan, Mount Pleasant, Tengah and the Keppel Club site, which is part of the Greater Southern Waterfront - will be ""planned upfront with good public transport, walking and cycling connections"", the authorities said. 
With limited parking provision, lots will be prioritised for residents in these precincts.
Two other areas - Tanjong Rhu and Pearl’s Hill - will also be gazetted by LTA as car-lite, while Bayshore's existing car-lite area will be expanded.
Ulu Pandan will be Singapore's first car-lite HDB precinct, designed for residents to adopt ""green modes of commuting"", HDB and LTA said. The first Build-to-Order (BTO) flats there are expected to be launched in the upcoming November 2022 sales exercise. 
Parking spaces will be reduced in precincts near Dover MRT station to free up space for other uses such as shared community spaces, pedestrian and cycling paths, parks and greenery, the authorities said. 
Residents of the new public housing projects in Ulu Pandan will have convenient access to rail and bus services, with sheltered elevated linkways connecting them directly to Dover MRT station and barrier-free accessibility to bus stops along Commonwealth Avenue. 
There will also be a network of walking and cycling paths, allowing convenient access to the neighbourhood centre and key amenities in Ghim Moh via the Park Connector Network. 





      HDB will introduce the following measures in car-lite precincts:
  

Season parking will be reduced and restricted to residents only, and will be prioritised for the first car of resident households.
Residents who buy season parking for their second and subsequent vehicles will be charged a higher season parking rate, subject to availability.
Short-term parking for visitors will remain available, but with limited lots. Parking charges may be adjusted based on demand.

20 places of worship opted for short-term tenancies while awaiting land policy review: Shanmugam,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/places-worship-religious-land-review-lease-renewal-2987786,"SINGAPORE: Since 2018, 20 places of worship have taken up short-term tenancies or temporary occupation licences instead of renewing their 30-year leases, while awaiting the Government's review of its policy on land allocation and pricing for religious organisations.
The Government had advised places of worship to take up the short-term option in order to benefit from the outcome of the review, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Oct 4).
Six places of worship still decided to proceed with a 30-year lease renewal at current market prices, the minister said in a written response to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied).
In recent years, land prices for places of worship have risen because of competitive bidding by religious organisations, said Mr Shanmugam.
""The Government has been in discussions with various religious organisations, to consider how best to assist them, in mitigating the price rises, which come from such bidding.
""And at the same time, the Government has been doing a review of our place of worship land allocation and pricing framework, to see how the price rises can be mitigated.""
He added that the Government has made significant progress on the review, and expects to announce more details ""soon"".
State land parcels are generally sold through a competitive tender process where the highest acceptable bid becomes the land price for the specific site.
This approach does not apply to land for mosques, which is directly alienated to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) at market price as determined by the chief valuer. MUIS centrally coordinates mosque development.
""This would generally result in mosque land being less expensive, because there is no bidding,"" said Mr Shanmugam.
For lease renewals of places of worship, the premium is also at current market price as determined by the chief valuer, who considers relevant transactions of religious land and adjusts for site attributes like location and land area.
The minister added that the Government ""cannot unilaterally adjust the price of land that is sold for places of worship use"", as it is required to sell land at fair market value under the reserves protection framework.
""Any change will require a change to the reserves protection framework and also the approval of the President,"" he said.
Proceeds from the sale of state land go to past reserves because state land is part of the past reserves. Land sale proceeds cannot be used by the Government for spending in the Budget."
"Mental health support, getting elderly on digital platform among MPs’ concerns about healthcare reform plan","During a debate on the Healthier SG strategy, Members of Parliament also asked about the number of family doctors and nurses that would be needed to fully implement the plan.  
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthier-sg-mental-health-elderly-digital-platform-debate-parliament-2986111,"SINGAPORE: Improving access to mental health support and helping patients who are less IT-savvy enrol in a voluntary national healthcare programme were among the suggestions raised during a debate on a parliamentary motion on Tuesday (Oct 4).
Led by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, the motion seeks to endorse a White Paper on Singapore’s new health strategy - also known as the Healthier SG initiative - and to form the basis of transforming Singapore’s healthcare system.
The new strategy aims to have citizens enrol with a single family doctor who knows their medical history well and can work with them to better manage their health needs.
It puts a stronger focus on preventive care, as Singapore tackles the challenges of an ageing population and the rising impact of chronic disease.
First announced during the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Committee of Supply Debate in March, Healthier SG will be open for enrolment to those aged 60 and above in the second half of 2023.
It will gradually be made available to those between 40 and 59 years old in the next two years. 
IMPROVING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH
Nineteen Members of Parliament (MPs) from both sides of the House rose to speak on the issue on Tuesday. Several of them asked how mental health would fit in Singapore’s new healthcare strategy, with growing awareness about the importance of mental well-being.
Noting that the White Paper did not include mental health as part of the first 12 care protocols being rolled out to family doctors, MP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) said there is a need to ensure that doctors and their staff members are adequately trained and supported to deal with patients who suffer from mental health.
She added that the referral system must also not be overly complicated, and healthcare workers need to have easily accessible references to know what resources are available to their patients.
“Not having adequate treatment or support, while suffering from mental health conditions, has an impact on all aspects of life ranging from economic output to physical health,” she said. 
MP Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar) raised concerns about whether general practitioners would be able to manage consultation time when it comes to patients who require mental health support, as it might require deeper attention.

SUPPORT FOR THE ELDERLY 
Other MPs raised possible challenges in getting seniors, who are less digitally savvy and mobile, to enrol and follow up with Healthier SG. 
Dr Wan Rizal asked if there are enough resources to support the elderly, who may live in older neighbourhoods with fewer GP clinics. 
""For the elderly who are less mobile or immobile, regular visits to the doctor may be challenging. How does MOH intend to engage and support them?"" Dr Wan Rizal said, suggesting that ground efforts - similar to those mooted during the COVID-19 pandemic - may be helpful to seniors.
He added that the elderly would need a longer consultation time, thus increasing the daily workload of doctors.
MP Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) asked how the Government would engage seniors who do not use smartphones. 
Those participating in Healthier SG will have a health plan on the digital platform HealthHub, which will record key points of discussions with doctors and track health outcomes. They will also be able to use the mobile application Healthy 365 to track physical activities and diets and get access to community activities.
However, Dr Tan said some seniors would not be comfortable with such technologies.
""There must be careful attention to ease of use, understanding what our seniors and elderly need and find easy to use. Technology must serve, adapt and bend to the person, rather than getting people to bend to the technology. Seniors who feel left behind by digital change should not be treated as having fallen by the wayside, or not able to adapt,"" he said. 
The plan to use technology to help implement the Healthier SG programme is “laudable” and should be explored, said Nominated Member of Parliament Janet Ang. 
The IT system, health communications network and the National Electronic Health Records systems are critical for the successful implementation of the initiative, she added. 
“MOH has done very well ... in this space but will need to continue to invest as more still needs to be done to ensure system up-time, efficient sharing and update of the patient’s health records while ensuring data is secure and personal data duly protected,” said Ms Ang. 
Doctors, nurses and staff will also need to be trained to educate and support patients in the enrolment and transition, she added. 
“What help and support will MOH provide to help the GPs and clinics transition to the level of digital that will enable them to perform their role in this healthcare model?” 
Ms Ang also expressed concern for elderly citizens who may be less familiar with technology, noting that there is a large group of seniors who may not be digitally savvy.
“How will MOH onboard this segment of citizens who are digitally naive and who are likely to be from lower-income households?” 
MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) stressed the need to improve outreach efforts to engage elderly patients. 
He noted that under the White Paper, the number of eldercare centres will increase from 119 to 220 by 2025. Eldercare centres will connect seniors with community programmes, offer community-based monitoring of vital signs such as blood pressure, in between visits to the doctor, as well as help to roll out other healthcare initiatives. 
However some elderly keep to themselves, while others live alone. In such cases, MOH can study how to improve outreach efforts so that all seniors can benefit from programmes under Healthier SG, said Mr Tan.

TRANSITION AND MANPOWER PLANNING  
Several MPs expressed concerns about the transition to the Healthier SG strategy, noting that manpower planning would be crucial. They also asked about the number of family doctors and nurses that would be needed to fully realise the Healthier SG strategy. 
The White Paper states that a fifth of Singapore's doctors and nurses are in primary and community care. To support the implementation of the strategy, the proportion will need to be increased to at least a quarter by 2030.
“While MOH and its various partners will undoubtedly put in much effort to ensure that more will start choosing family medicine as a vocation, efforts are also hampered by what is traditionally seen to be a ‘lesser status’ of family doctors,” she added. 
Family doctors and physicians in the public polyclinics will take on a significant portion of the Healthier SG workload, even as GPs can step up and do more, said MP Xie Yao Quan (PAP-Jurong). 
“For the public healthcare sector, we need stability to become a key principle in manpower planning,” he added. 
“So within the polyclinics, I would like to ask what happens to enrolment arrangements when family doctors and physicians within these polyclinics move, get rotated, or cross-deployed, as they routinely do? Do patients move with the doctors?
The debate on the White Paper continues on Wednesday.
“Fundamentally, are Singaporeans going to be enrolled with a polyclinic, or to a particular doctor within the polyclinic?” 
Mr Xie suggested that there be less rotation and more stability in manpower planning for all polyclinics across all three healthcare clusters. 
He also suggested that clinical manpower recruitment, posting and deployment across the three healthcare clusters be centralised at the ministry level going forward. 
Manpower issues may not be solved just by hiring more healthcare workers, as the experience of each staff member is also important, said NMP Dr Tan Yia Swam, who is also president of the Singapore Medical Association. 
“Losing a nurse with 10 years of experience and intensive care unit training - can she be replaced by five new nurses?” 
Dr Tan urged the Health Ministry to look at retaining staff - for senior and trained doctors to stay in the public sectors, and experienced nurses and allied healthcare workers to want to stay in Singapore. 
“It is good that there's more training and new hires for Singaporeans and for foreigners, but how do we actually retain them?”"
"Allow one-time transfer of bank home loans back to HDB to help some cope with high interest rates, suggests MP","In an adjournment motion, MP Saktiandi Supaat outlined several suggestions to help Singaporeans and businesses navigate rising interest rates.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/higher-interest-rate-bank-loans-hdb-loan-saktiandi-supaat-suggestions-2985636,"SINGAPORE: Eligible flat owners should be allowed to make a one-time transfer of their bank home loans back to the Housing and Development Board (HDB) as a way to help more vulnerable Singaporeans cope with the high interest rates, Member of Parliament Saktiandi Supaat suggested on Tuesday (Oct 4). 
Speaking during an adjournment motion, Mr Saktiandi (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) called for some policies to be made flexible, noting that home owners who opt for or refinance their loans with banks are currently no longer allowed to take up an HDB loan. 
When bank loans were as low as 1.15 to 1.5 per cent, the fixed interest rate on HDB loans was “certainly less attractive”, he said.
But local banks have been raising home loan rates to around 3.85 per cent, surpassing the 2.6 per cent applicable to HDB loans.
""With the present global interest rate hikes set to continue, they will now be locked into a higher rate than the HDB rate which they were trying to find a lower alternative for,"" he added.
Mr Saktiandi, who is an economist by training, asked if the Government could provide HDB borrowers “more advanced guidance” on potential rate changes beyond three months to allow new and existing home owners to make more informed decisions. 
“We must also ensure that Singapore is prepared in the extraordinary event where home loan rates rise sharply, such as if the US Federal Reserve raises its rates to above 5 per cent,” he said. 
“Will the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) consider implementing temporary measures such as rate ceilings to ensure that rates do not spiral out of control and become unaffordable?” 
Highlighting neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia with subsidised housing loans targeted at lower-income citizens, Mr Saktiandi said this can be “an interim policy measure” worth considering for “vulnerable groups not captured by the concessionary HDB loan”.

Tightened property loan criteria 'timely, well-calibrated'; will instil buyer 'discipline', say analysts













FOSTER BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF INTEREST RATES  
Mr Saktiandi also outlined three other suggestions to help Singaporeans navigate rising interest rates. 
First, the Government should fill in the “information gap” around higher interest rates, especially for “less financially-savvy Singaporeans” who might not realise how they are impacted, such as how much more income or savings they need to service the loan subsequently, he suggested. 
Financial institutions should “proactively clarify” the impact to their borrowers, he added.
“While there may be certain uncertainties that may affect the precise impact of an interest rate rise on a particular borrower, the financial institutions can provide an indicative range to give the borrower an idea,” he said. 
“This boils down to the basic principle of balancing caveat emptor for the investor (or) customer versus whether banks owe a social duty of care to more than just the average bank customer.”
This practice will also mean that financial institutions can preempt when home buyers might encounter issues servicing higher home loans if their incomes and savings rates become insufficient, added Mr Saktiandi. 
“In such cases, I hope the Government or relevant agencies work with the financial institutions to allow for longer-term mortgage tenures to accommodate home buyers who struggle to pay higher instalments. Or at the very least be more alert now about such cases and offer some flexibility in (the) current environment as a baseline,” he said. 
ASSISTING SMES AND FIRMS 
Second, a suggestion was made for financial assistance to extend beyond individuals. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and firms, especially those operating in sectors that are highly reliant on external financing, should receive “targeted help” too, said Mr Saktiandi. 
He noted, for instance, that the construction and manufacturing sectors are “sensitive to interest rate hikes”, as they are capital intensive and dependent on commercial loans. 
The Government may need to step in to provide “reliable and affordable sources of temporary financing”, such as the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme, added Mr Saktiandi. 
He asked for the processing fees of government-assisted loans from financial institutions to be kept “as low as possible”. 
“We should make sure that the measures apply across both bank and non-bank financial institutions or lenders. The latter might rise in prominence in the lending sector, if the rise in interest rates makes it harder for those with relatively lower creditworthiness or urgent credit needs to access bank loans. Several of them already target SMEs primarily,” said Mr Saktiandi. 






      Member of Parliament Saktiandi Supaat delivers an adjournment motion on helping Singaporeans navigate high interest rates on Oct 4, 2022. 
    






ADJUST METRICS FOR MEASURING “SYSTEMIC RISK” 
Finally, as Singapore transitions into a high-interest rate environment, Mr Saktiandi suggested an adjustment of metrics for measuring systemic risk, adding that measuring it “improperly” or “with a decent lag” could lead to social implications. 
The interest rate used to calculate loan repayments under the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) is 3.5 per cent or the prevailing market rate - whichever is higher. The idea was to build in a buffer against interest rate rises.
But with today's bank interest rates hitting more than 3 per cent and the US Fed’s expectation that its benchmark rate may hit close to 4.4 per cent this year and rise more next year, the “buffer” built into the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) monitoring framework may soon be “completely eroded”, said Mr Saktiandi.
He questioned whether it was sufficient to raise by 0.5 percentage points the rate used to calculate loan repayments under the TDSR, as announced in the recent round of property cooling measures. 
“Is this move sufficient to maintain the robustness of MAS monitoring and stress testing? Given the rate of global interest rate increases and their potential landing points at up to 5 per cent, is the MAS prepared to raise this again, potentially in a matter of a few months? 
“What is the impact of the current 0.5 per cent adjustment on the TDSR data, and what would the projected impact of further increases be, considering the median TDSR of 43 per cent?” he said.
Mr Saktiandi explained that housing loans are “a long tenure”, with “significant overhang and forward risk exposures” if interest rates go up.
""And in an alternative worst-case scenario, if there is a wave of defaults (or) repossessions, there is always the risk of market instability with cascading social implications,"" he added.

HOUSEHOLD DEBT SITUATION REMAINS “HEALTHY”  
In response to Mr Saktiandi’s suggestions to help Singaporeans cope with rising interest rates, Senior Minister of State for Finance Chee Hong Tat acknowledged that the higher interest rates “may not be a passing phenomenon” so it is important to prepare for the change. 
The Government will continue to ensure that essential areas such as public housing, healthcare and education will remain affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans, he said. 
On public housing, the Government will continue to sell new flats below market value with significant housing subsidies, in order to encourage home ownership and enable as many families as possible to own homes.
Mr Chee added that the household debt situation in Singapore remains “healthy”, because of “prudent policies” on unsecured consumer lending as well as residential mortgages. 
The recent property cooling measures to increase the medium-term interest rate floor used to compute the TDSR and Mortgage Servicing Ratio for property loans by financial institutes, as well as the interest rate floor for computing eligible loan amounts for HDB loans, are examples of such policies, he highlighted. 
Addressing Mr Saktiandi’s point on helping borrowers better understand their loan commitments, Mr Chee said MAS currently requires financial institutions to explain how a borrower’s monthly mortgage instalments would vary if interest rates increase. 
Similarly, non-financial institutions such as licensed moneylenders are required to use a language that the borrower understands to explain the terms of the loan contract and the breakdown of each repayment that goes into servicing the principal amount and other costs. 
“In addition, licensed moneylenders are only permitted to impose fixed borrowing costs and fixed interest rates, ensuring that borrowers would not be caught off-guard by rising interest rates,” he said. 
HELPING BUSINESSES THROUGH SCHEMES
Most businesses in Singapore are currently able to manage “debt-related risks” with sufficient liquidity holdings alongside post-COVID earnings recovery, and the Government will continue to assist them through various credit schemes, said Mr Chee. 
He noted that with the expiry of the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme, businesses can still tap the Enterprise Financing Scheme, which supports access to financing for a wide range of business activities.
“Importantly, businesses would need to double down on efforts to improve productivity and upgrade the skills of their workers. This is the most effective way to improve our overall competitiveness and achieve a win-win outcome for both businesses and workers through economic growth,” he added. 
For these purposes, businesses can turn to schemes like the Productivity Solutions Grant, the Energy Efficiency Grant, SkillsFuture subsidies and the newly introduced S$70 million NTUC Company Training Committee Grant. 
The Government will also continue to provide Workfare Income Supplement and other support measures to boost the earnings of lower-wage workers.
But while the Government will look after individuals, households and businesses, Mr Chee highlighted the significance of “the high degree of trust in our society”. 
“Trust has allowed us to weather many uncertainties together, including our fight against COVID-19, and it will be a critical success factor as we face new challenges going ahead, such as rising inflation and higher interest rates,” he said."

"Jail for business owner who caught COVID-19, but left isolation to work","Wang Shaowei was one of those who tested positive for COVID-19 in the period that Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre was closed down for deep cleaning last year due to COVID-19 cases. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-wholesale-business-owner-pasir-panjang-wholesale-centre-covid-19-breach-isolation-order-2985251,"SINGAPORE: A wholesale business owner who went to work despite testing positive for COVID-19 was jailed for 12 weeks on Tuesday (Oct 4).
Wang Shaowei, 38, left his place of isolation on 15 occasions for his business, including collecting order forms and visiting a car park in Ubi that served as a vegetable wholesale centre. 
He pleaded guilty to one charge of leaving his place of isolation without authorities' permission. Another 14 charges of a similar nature were considered for his sentencing. 
The Singaporean was the sole proprietor of a wholesale trading business dealing with goods such as beverages, fruits and vegetables. 
As part of his business, Wang would regularly visit Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre to pack food items that would be loaded onto lorries for delivery to clients. 
In September last year, a significant number of COVID-19 cases were detected at the centre, resulting in its closure for three days for cleaning and disinfection. 
As Wang frequented the centre as part of his business, he was made to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on Sep 29 last year. He was informed the next day that he tested positive for COVID-19.

Wang was then issued an isolation order under the Infectious Diseases Act, which required him to remain and be isolated at his residence from Sep 29 to 12pm on Oct 8, 2021. 
While Wang was offered a second PCR test to ascertain whether he could end his isolation earlier, he chose not to take this test. 
The court heard that despite the isolation order, Wang left his residence on 15 occasions between Oct 1 and Oct 8, 2021.
This included leaving client order forms in a plastic bag at the staircase landing near his home, which one of his siblings would subsequently collect. He also met his siblings on one occasion to pack customer orders. 
Calling it an egregious breach of his isolation order, Deputy Public Prosecutor Dhiraj G Chainani said Wang acted in ""his own selfish interests"" and placed members of the public at risk.
""The accused’s actions were reckless and irresponsible and they occurred at a time where every Singaporean was expected to be socially responsible in order to curb the spread of COVID-19,"" added Mr Dhiraj, who argued for four months' jail. 
The court heard that on one occasion Wang left his residence, he intended to address some complaints about the quality of goods supplied by his business. 
He asked his brother to drive him to an open-air car park along Ubi Avenue 3 next to Block 2014 Ubi Industrial E Estate, which served as a vegetable wholesale centre at night. 
There, Wang checked on his goods and packed fruits and vegetables for deliveries. He remained at the car park from 10.18pm on Oct 2 to 5.14am on Oct 3. He then returned home. 
In the seven hours he was outside, Wang interacted with his siblings and was around other importers and suppliers of vegetables.
""The accused proceeded to act in a selfish manner that created a significant risk of him spreading COVID-19, both to his loved ones as well as other members of the public present at the Ubi car park,"" said Mr Dhiraj. 
For leaving his place of isolation without permission, Wang could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both."
"Doping testing regime in place for Singapore's national athletes, with those at higher risk tested more often","There is a framework of rules and standards to keep sports in Singapore free of doping, says Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/joseph-schooling-doping-amanda-lim-teong-tzen-wei-national-athletes-testing-2985316,"SINGAPORE: There is a framework of rules and standards to keep sports in Singapore free of doping, which includes the use of both recreational drugs and performance-enhancing drugs, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) Eric Chua on Tuesday (Oct 4).
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Chua said that this aims to equip national athletes with the information, tools and values for them to exercise ""sound judgement and choices"" when it comes to the use of drugs.
There are two key strategies by which this is implemented - through education and prevention, as well as detection and deterrence, he added.
Mr Chua was responding to questions from MPs Dr Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar) and Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) on measures to protect Singapore’s carded athletes from the misuse of drugs, and whether the Government or National Sports Associations (NSA) have programmes that regularly test national and elite athletes for recreational drug use and performance-enhancing drug use.
The Government established Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) as the national anti-doping authority in Singapore in 2010.
""SportSG (Sport Singapore) works with ADS and the broader sporting fraternity to ensure that sport in Singapore is free of doping, and that our national athletes compete fairly and safely, and that they can be upheld as role models for Singapore and Singaporeans,"" said Mr Chua, who pointed out that ADS oversees a ""robust"" doping testing regime.
""ADS develops and regularly reviews a test distribution plan for athletes, with higher testing frequencies for athletes assessed to be at higher risk of doping. Several factors are considered in determining the risk level of doping, such as the athlete’s performance and type of sports,"" he said.
ADS’ testing regime covers both in-competition and out-of-competition tests.
The authority also relies on intelligence, such as whistleblowing sources, to identify and investigate allegations of drug abuse, including following up to conduct tests on alleged offenders, Mr Chua added.
Education is also a ""key preventive measure"" to discourage intentional or inadvertent doping, and this is done through various means such as the mandatory completion of modules on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s e-learning platform and ADS working with NSAs to plan, implement and monitor programmes for athletes, said Mr Chua.
""To prevent inadvertent doping, ADS provides the ‘Check Drugs’ function on its website to enable athletes and support personnel to check on the prohibited status of a particular drug or substance,"" he added.
""The database contains more than 9,000 medications registered in Singapore and is updated monthly. For medications not on the database, athletes can and should check with a sports physician, or with ADS directly.""

'I made a mistake and I accept the consequences': Schooling disappointed by news of SportSG sanctions













ADS imposes sanctions on athletes found to have violated anti-doping rules.
These range from a few months to a lifetime ban, depending on the degree of fault and intention, type of substance used and aggravating circumstances, said Mr Chua.
Other sanctions may also be imposed such as SportSG suspending the spexScholarship or other support offered to a carded athlete.
An NSA may also suspend training support for an athlete or their selection for competitions. The Singapore National Olympic Committee (SNOC) or Singapore National Paralympic Committee (SNPC) can also separately suspend the selection of the athlete for any major Games for the appropriate period.
Last week, Sport Singapore (SportSG) said that it would suspend all support for national swimmers Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim and Teong Tzen Wei, after they confessed to consuming controlled drugs overseas.
For a month beginning from Oct 1, the three carded athletes - who come under a sporting high performance scheme - will not receive training assistance grants or have access to sports science and sports medicine facilities and services, said SportSG then.
The Ministry of Defence also said earlier that Schooling would no longer be eligible for leave or disruption to train or compete while in National Service.
Lim was given a stern warning by CNB under the Misuse of Drugs Act for possessing a drug utensil.
It is illegal for Singaporeans and permanent residents to consume cannabis, whether in Singapore or overseas.
The substance is also on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned in-competition drugs.
On Tuesday, Mr Chua stressed that it was also important to consider a rehabilitative approach to help the athlete not offend again.
Said Mr Chua: ""The Government and the local sporting fraternity look upon the misuse of drugs as a serious matter.
""SportSG, ADS and the fraternity will continue to work together to underscore the importance of complying with Singapore’s laws on drugs and anti-doping rules at all times."""
"74 Home Team officers have died in service since January 2018, with 8 deaths ruled as suicide",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-home-team-officer-death-suicide-gunshot-marina-bay-2985376,"SINGAPORE: A total of 74 Home Team officers died in service between January 2018 and September 2022, with eight of these deaths ruled as suicide, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling in Parliament on Tuesday (Oct 4).
""The majority of these deaths were due to illnesses or natural causes,"" she said.
""The cause of death for three others which had elements to suggest possible suicide, are pending coronial investigations.""
Ms Sun was responding to questions from MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) and Nominated MP Shahira Abdullah, who asked about measures to support police officers' mental well-being and to assess the state of their mental health.
Their questions came after a police officer was found dead with a gunshot wound at a boardwalk near Marina Bay Sands on Sep 19.
Police later said he used his service pistol to fire three shots - the third to his head.

Mr Zhulkarnain also cited a report from last year which said that law enforcement officers in the United States were 54 per cent more likely to die by suicide than the average American - and that they were more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.
""We don't want to be faced with a similar situation here in Singapore,"" he said, calling the Marina Bay incident a ""tragic case"".
""Every suicide is one too many and I do not wish to trivialise the situation,"" Ms Sun replied, although she pointed out that the situation in Singapore was ""different"".
She highlighted that the suicide rate among Ministry of Home Affairs staff, which includes Home Team officers, is about half that of Singapore's national average.
According to the suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore, 378 people took their own lives in 2021.
Ms Sun said police officers have access to a 24/7 helpline managed by in-house psychologists and senior para-counsellors.
Home Team officers can also turn to an external agency-administered 24/7 helpline.
""The Home Team makes external counselling services available to all our officers, including frontline officers. The aim is to make it easier for them to access external help,"" she said.
""This is confidential and anonymous, and we do not track who attends these services. The external counsellors will activate emergency services if they assess that there could be a threat of harm by the officers to themselves or to others.""
Ms Sun said the police also do not track the number of officers who have sought counselling or para-counselling help, and that officers are not required to report that they sought help. This is to encourage those with problems to come forward.
Police psychologists try to demystify the myths and stigma of help-seeking during their regular mental health outreach to all police officers, she added.
""Officers who seek help are not specifically disadvantaged in their career because they had sought help. They are assessed on their on-the-job performance, and their promotion is based on merit and their potential to assume higher appointments.""
LOOKING OUT FOR RED FLAGS
When it comes to looking out for signs of poor mental health, Ms Sun said Home Team officers go through resilience and stress management training, including the detection of personal distress and suicide prevention.
""Staff feedback is collected through regular staff engagement and pulse surveys, and the concerns raised include issues which officers may face in the workplace,"" she said.
""Home Team supervisors are trained with the skills to identify and support officers who need help. This approach and culture have been built over many years.""
When MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked whether the ministry has studied the psychosocial factors that contribute to suicide cases, Ms Sun reiterated that there are regular staff engagement activities in both small and large groups.
""For instance, for myself, I engage officers over breakfast, sometimes 10 people to 20 people, to hear perhaps the tensions or stresses they may be facing to really get ground-up feedback and get a sense of what they're facing - whether or not it is in their personal lives or what they are facing in terms of their everyday work environment,"" she said.
""This is continuous ongoing work and we will need the help of family and friends because family and friends are often the most connected to these officers, and they would know if there are any life-changing events that would throw them off course and lead them to choose a very unfortunate way out.""
PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR OFFICERS BEARING ARMS
Mr Zhulkarnain also asked about precautionary measures for police and auxiliary police officers who bear arms in the course of their duties.
Ms Sun said these officers undergo security vetting before employment, while all police officers and most auxiliary police forces go through medical and psychological assessments as part of the recruitment process.
""Supervisors engage officers to check on their well-being. Officers are also encouraged to alert their supervisors they think their peers may need help,"" she said.
""If officers are assessed at any point to be unsuitable to carry firearms, they will not be issued with firearms and will be redeployed to other duties to allow them to settle down or recover from whatever strains they may be facing.""
In September 2020, a Certis CISCO auxiliary police officer was found dead at an East Coast Park car park with a gunshot wound to his head.
His death was ruled as a suicide, and the security firm has since improved its procedures for tracking issued firearms and ensuring their timely return.
Mr Murali suggested using geofencing technology to manage auxiliary police officers who leave their posts bearing arms. These officers are usually recruited from a wider background and have static duties, he said.
Ms Sun responded that the Government could ""have a think about it"".
""But I think we do have to balance the need for privacy as well as the needs of the job,"" she said."
"Free screenings for diabetes, hypertension and some cancers under Healthier SG initiative",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/free-screening-diabetes-hypertension-cancer-healthier-sg-initiative-gp-2985296,"SINGAPORE: Those who enrol under Healthier SG - a voluntary national primary care programme - will be able to undergo free screenings for three common chronic conditions as well as three types of cancers, announced Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Oct 4).
They are: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia as well as breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer.
As for those with specific risk factors, they may be referred for further tests.
Noting that complex screenings such as colonoscopy may not be appropriate to be made a standard screening for everyone, he said these will not be free but will continue to be heavily subsidised in hospitals.
Mr Ong was speaking in Parliament, where he led a motion to endorse a White Paper on Healthier SG as the basis of the transformation of Singapore’s healthcare system.
It comes as the country races to tackle the challenges of an ageing population and the rising impact of chronic disease.

Costs, flexibility in choosing doctors among concerns raised about Singapore’s healthcare reform initiative













The new strategy aims to have citizens take charge of their own healthcare, where they can enrol with a single doctor who will support them in their health needs throughout their lives. This can either be a general practitioner or a polyclinic doctor.
Under proposed plans, those who choose to enrol in Healthier SG will be able to schedule face-to-face onboarding health consultation, which will be paid for by the Government.
They can then develop health plans with their doctors, who will continue to monitor the resident's progress via follow-ups. This will provide an overview of their health status, medical needs as well as health goals, followed by an action plan, such as lifestyle adjustments or weight management.
First announced during the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Committee of Supply debate in March, Healthier SG - which is voluntary - will be open to those aged 60 and above to enrol in the second half of 2023.
It will gradually be made available to those between 40 and 59 years old in the next two years.

ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES AND USING MEDISAVE
An additional subsidy tier will be added to the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) for common chronic drugs and drug price limits.
This is to level the significant price difference of drugs between GP clinics and polyclinics, so that residents will be encouraged to stick with the family doctor of their choice. 
All enrolled Singaporean CHAS card holders, including Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation card holders, will be able to benefit from this. 
Mr Ong pointed out that the price will not be able to equalise ""down to the last cent"" as the basis of calculating subsidies at Polyclinics and for CHAS are different.
However, the current difference in drug prices between Polyclinics and private GP clinics will be ""substantively"" removed, he said. 
Another key change under the Healthier SG initiative is that those using MediSave to pay for the treatment of chronic illnesses will no longer have to co-pay 15 per cent of the bill using cash. Instead, they will be able to pay the full amount with MediSave.
Noting that most Government subsidy schemes require some co-payment from residents to reflect a ""sharing of responsibility"", Mr Ong said this further subsidy is justified as it will result in personal actions to make changes and lead a healthier life.
He added that community partners such as the People's Association and Sport Singapore will organise more health-related activities to support active lifestyles. 
The Healthy 365 app, which is currently used for initiatives such as the National Steps Challenge and the Eat Drink Shop Healthy Challenge, will also be enhanced to include features such as tracking calorie intake.
SPENDING MORE ON PREVENTIVE CARE
Today, Singapore's national healthcare expenditure is expected to be about S$22 billion a year however, this is expected to nearly triple to S$60 billion in 2030.
To slow down the rate of increase in healthcare spending, the Government is focusing more on preventive care in hopes of helping citizens become healthier.
Currently, about 6 per cent of Singapore’s annual healthcare budget is spent on preventive care such as funding the Health Promotion Board (HPB). However, Mr Ong said the hope is to increase this under the new healthcare reform initiative.
“With Healthier SG, in the coming few years, we will and we want to grow this - perhaps to double the share of total healthcare expenditure,” said Mr Ong.
He added that the set-up cost of Healthier SG is estimated to cost more than S$1 billion over the next three to four years. This will be used to fund new IT systems, ground support capabilities, and to give general practitioners (GPs) a “one-time support” for the necessary IT enhancements to bring them on board.
Beyond this, there will also be recurrent costs, he said.
This includes funding support measures for residents and the annual service fee for GPs, he said, adding that this is estimated to cost another S$400 million per year.
“In making these investments, our primary motivation is to reduce disease burden, reduce the suffering of our people and their loved ones,” he said.
“If this national medical bill instead of tripling, doubles in the next ten years - we would have saved much more than what we are planning to spend on preventive care,” he added."
"HDB will incur S$270 million development loss from Central Weave BTO flats in Ang Mo Kio, says Desmond Lee",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-270-million-loss-central-weave-amk-bto-2985301,"SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will incur an estimated development loss of about S$270 million from the Central Weave @ Ang Mo Kio Build-to-Order (BTO) project, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said in Parliament on Tuesday (Oct 4).
The project was launched in HDB's August BTO exercise, and drew more than eight potential first-time buyers for each unit in the four-room, five-room and 3Gen flats located in the mature town of Ang Mo Kio.
Mr Lee said an estimated development loss of about S$250 million for the project would increase to about S$270 million after considering the Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grants given to eligible buyers.
The estimated land cost for the project was S$500 million, determined independently by the chief valuer using market valuation principles, said the minister, who was responding to a question by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai.
""Land forms part of the past reserves, hence when HDB uses the land for development, the money that HDB will need to pay for the land must be paid back into the past reserves, which are invested and grown for future generations and are protected,"" said Mr Lee.
""The Government cannot use proceeds from land sales as revenue for spending in the budget.""
He also said that HDB does not price new flats based on cost.
""HDB first establishes their market value by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby as well as the individual attributes of the flats and prevailing market conditions,"" said Mr Lee.
""To derive the selling prices, HDB applies a significant subsidy to the assessed market values to ensure that new flats are affordable to those buying their first home.""
The statutory board also provides further grants such as the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant, Proximity Housing Grant and the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant among others, to help specific demographic groups with their homeownership aspirations.
Mr Lee stressed that HDB incurs a ""significant"" deficit every year as the amount it collects from the sale of flats is ""far less"" than the cost of building and housing grant disbursements.
The Housing Board recorded a deficit of S$3.85 billion for its Homeownership Programme for the financial year 2021/2022, while the average deficit incurred in the last three years was about S$2.68 billion a year.
""So claims that HDB profits from the development and sale of HDB flats are false. HDB will continue to ensure that public housing remains affordable and accessible for all Singaporeans,"" said Mr Lee.
In September, Facebook page The Alternative View was issued a Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) correction direction for suggesting that HDB profited from the sale of the Central Weave BTO flats.
At the time, MND said that HDB would incur a loss from the project as the estimated amount to be collected from the sale was lower than the estimated total development cost.

"Strong incentive for beverage container return scheme to be run efficiently, cost-effectively: Amy Khor",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/strong-incentive-producer-beverage-container-return-scheme-cost-efficient-environment-sustainability-2985291,"SINGAPORE: An initiative to encourage people to recycle their used drink containers for a refundable deposit will be run by the beverage production industry, which will then have a strong incentive to operate efficiently and cost-effectively, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor on Tuesday (Oct 4). 
Dr Khor was replying to parliamentary questions on the beverage container return scheme, which is in its consultation phase after the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched a survey to gather public feedback on Sep 20. 
Under the scheme, consumers of pre-packaged beverages will pay a refundable deposit - currently estimated to be around 10 to 20 cents - in addition to the cost of the drink.
Consumers will get this deposit back if they return their used containers to return points. These locations have yet to be confirmed.
NEA previously said the scheme would cover plastic bottles and metal cans from 150ml to 3L. This will cover more than 1 billion beverage containers in Singapore each year. 
MPs Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast), Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) and Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang) had asked about the costs and scale of the scheme.
In reply, Dr Khor said beverage producers, such as manufacturers and importers, will be responsible for the collection and recycling of the products they put on the market, as well as funding the scheme.
In similar schemes overseas, producers typically appoint an operator to carry out their responsibilities under the scheme. An industry-led, not-for-profit scheme operator is preferred, she said.
“As the scheme is owned and run by the industry, it will have a strong incentive to operate the scheme efficiently and cost-effectively, to keep scheme costs low for all parties,"" said Dr Khor.
""In addition, the revenue from the sale of clean, high quality and high-value recyclables, and any unclaimed deposits, will be utilised by the scheme operator to reduce the scheme costs.""





Related:














Consumers of pre-packaged drinks may have to pay 10-20 cent deposit under proposed recycling scheme













On whether costs might be passed on to consumers in the form of increased beverage prices, Dr Khor said prices would likely be moderated by competition within the industry - which is the case in other countries with a similar scheme. 
To ensure the scheme operator is efficient, effective and operates fairly across multiple producers, the Government will exercise regulatory oversight over the scheme operator.
The scheme operator will need to be licensed by the NEA and will need to meet conditions set by the agency, such as a collection target. 
While NEA previously said the Government was considering mandated return points at large supermarkets with a total area of more than 200 sq m, Dr Khor suggested that containers could be returned at food and beverage premises. 
At these premises, operators and stallholders will have the flexibility to decide whether to collect the deposit and pass the beverage containers to their patrons, she said.
“There is a wide range of such premises, from casual settings to more formal settings, and each would have its own preference. For example, stallholders could serve the customer the beverage with its container and charge the deposit, in which case the customers can take away the empty beverage containers and return them at designated return points to claim the refund on their deposit,” Dr Khor explained. 
Alternatively, the stallholder could pour the beverage into a cup before serving. In this case, stallholders would not need to charge the deposit as the customer does not receive the beverage container.
The stallholder will be able to collect used beverage containers and claim the refund of deposits on these containers. 
“We expect the former to apply in more casual settings such as coffee shops and hawker centres as the shop owners would typically have their customers pay the deposit and take the beverage container,” said Dr Khor. 
F&B operators may also choose to set up return points at their premises. 
In overseas schemes, the scheme operator pays handling fees to return point operators to reimburse costs incurred.
The locations of these return points can be in suitable public spaces such as community clubs and sports facilities, in addition to hawker centres.
Return point operators may choose manual over-the-counter return points or opt for automated Reverse Vending Machines.
In a supplementary question, Mr Ang asked whether the deposit or refund would attract any Goods and Services Tax (GST). 
Dr Khor said: “Based on the intended design scheme, GST will not be chargeable on the deposit.”
The ongoing consultation by NEA will be open until Oct 14, 2022."
"Teachers' unions refer 60 cases to MOE each year, issues range from grievances to posting requests",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teachers-unions-ministry-education-case-referrals-issues-grievances-leave-posting-requests-2985241,"SINGAPORE: Teachers' unions in Singapore refer 60 cases to the Ministry of Education (MOE) each year, with issues ranging from perceived unfairness in appraisal to posting matters.
In a written response to a parliamentary question from Nominated Member of Parliament Abdul Samad Abdul Wahab, MOE said on Monday (Oct 3): “Some are related to workplace grievances such as perceived unfairness in appraisal or workplace relations, whereas others may involve requests such as those related to posting or leave matters. 
“Besides these individual cases, unions also surface enquiries from members, to seek clarification on general HR policies.” 
The Education Ministry added that it regularly engages the four teachers' unions affiliated with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) - the Singapore Teachers’ Union, the Singapore Chinese Teachers’ Union, the Singapore Malay Teachers’ Union and the Singapore Tamil Teachers’ Union.
This allows for the mutual sharing of staff-related issues and for unions to “provide ground sensing and feedback on staff policies” to MOE.
“MOE follows up on all cases referred from the unions, and then closes the loop with the individual member as well as the union,” said MOE in its response. 
At the September sitting of Parliament, Mr Abdul Samad, who is the vice-president of NTUC, had said in an adjournment motion that teachers' unions receive more than 1,000 cases of grievances each year. 
These cases range from managing students’ behaviour, abuse from parents, and issues relating to mental health or career progression.

Government will do what is necessary to ensure affordable public housing for Singaporeans: Desmond Lee,"To address demand, HDB is prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025 if needed, says the Minister for National Development.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-market-hdb-public-housing-affordable-desmond-lee-2985066,"SINGAPORE: The Government will intervene and do what is ""necessary"" to ensure affordable public housing for Singaporeans as well as a stable property market, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Oct 4).
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Lee said this has been the authorities' approach all along.
""We will do so decisively but also carefully, being cognizant of the uncertain global economic outlook and rising interest rate environment, which will affect home prices and contribute to uncertainty in our property market,"" Mr Lee said.
He added the Government will monitor the market and make policy adjustments, if necessary, on both the demand and supply side, to ensure that housing prices are largely in step with economic fundamentals.
""This Government is committed to the stability of the wider Singapore property market, and to keeping public housing inclusive, affordable, and accessible to Singaporeans,"" he said.
The minister was responding to questions from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) who had asked what measures are being taken to address the growing sentiment that Singapore's property market is unaffordable for the masses.
Mr Yip had also asked how the recent adjustments to manpower policies will affect property prices; and what else the Government will do to ensure housing remains affordable for Singaporeans if housing market conditions do not improve.
STRONG DEMAND FOR HOUSING
In his reply, Mr Lee listed a number of reasons for ""strong, broad-based demand"" for housing over the last two years.
He pointed out that there have been more households forming as those who are in their 30s get married, especially with the easing of COVID-19 measures.

Singapore announces new property cooling measures: Higher ABSD rates, tighter loan limits













In addition, there are also societal trends shifting to smaller households, as young couples, singles and adult children opt to buy their own homes instead of living together with their parents, Mr Lee said. 
Due to construction delays caused by COVID-19, more homebuyers have also turned to the resale market because of longer waiting times for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, Mr Lee explained. Since 2020, the Government has also seen more private property owners and existing HDB owners cash out on their property and enter the resale market, he added.
""These demand factors, alongside the previous low interest rate environment that made it cheaper to service a home loan, have put upward pressure on HDB resale flat prices,"" he said.
Mr Lee noted that since the Government implemented a package of measures in December 2021, the HDB Resale Price Index increased by 5.3 per cent in the first half of this year.
The cooling measures include raising Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates, tightening the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) threshold and lowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit for loans from HDB.
Mr Lee acknowledged concerns about housing affordability, and said that the Government has been ""carefully monitoring"" the housing market.
""We are committed to keeping public housing affordable and accessible, to meet the housing aspirations of Singaporeans, and to help Singaporeans own their own homes. This is a key, long-standing national priority, and provides the basic foundation for us to raise our families, bring up our children, and build strong communities,"" he said.

How have BTO flats in prime areas fared since their launch?













""That is why we continue to build and sell new HDB flats at prices below the market as they come with significant subsidies.""
Mr Lee pointed out that the average price for a new four-room flat in a non-mature estate has remained ""relatively stable"" at S$341,000 in 2019 and $348,000 in the first three quarters of 2022.
To keep new flats affordable, market subsidies have also been increased, Mr Lee said.
""For new flats in prime, central locations, we have introduced the Prime Location Public Housing Model which provides additional subsidies on top of the substantial subsidies already provided for BTO flats. This is to keep flats in such locations affordable for a wide range of Singaporeans,"" Mr Lee added.
Mr Yip had also asked if the affordability of HDB flats should be pegged to median household incomes or other indicators, given that salaries within the 30th percentile and below are significantly less compared with the median percentile on the salary scale.
""Our affordability benchmarks do not only consider median incomes, as we provide a wide range of BTO flats for first-time homebuyers with different housing needs and budgets,"" said Mr Lee.
HOME PRICE-TO-INCOME RATIO
He gave the example of a first-timer household earning about S$5,000, slightly less than the 30th percentile of resident household incomes.
""They may buy a four-room flat in any of the three non-mature estate projects in the recent August 2022 BTO exercise, namely in Jurong East, Woodlands and Choa Chu Kang. These projects come with typical prices comparable to or lower than the average price of BTO flats in non-mature estates at about S$348,000,"" explained Mr Lee.
""After factoring in the S$45,000 in grants they would receive, they will need to use about 23 per cent of their monthly income for their housing loan, which means they will be able to service their mortgages from their monthly CPF contributions with no cash outlay.""
This would work out to a home price-to-income ratio of about five for the family, which is to say that the price of their home is about five times their annual household income.
Mr Lee noted that the ratio of the median home price to the median household income in other ""comparable"" cities such as London, Los Angeles and Sydney was at about eight to 15 times, and more than 20 times in Hong Kong.
In another scenario, a couple - earning a combined S$6,500 a month - would have a home price-to-income ratio of around four, Mr Lee said.
He noted that the ratio of the median home price to the median household income in other ""comparable"" cities such as London, Los Angeles and Sydney was at about eight to 15 times, and more than 20 times in Hong Kong.

Singapore introduces property cooling measures, with stricter borrowing criteria and tighter limits for HDB loans













When it comes to resale flats, Mr Lee said that the Government provides ""significant"" housing grants of up to S$160,000 to ensure resale flats remain affordable for eligible first-timer families. It also reviews grants regularly, he added.
""Generally, the mortgage servicing ratio, which is the proportion of monthly income used to service mortgage instalment payments, has remained below 25 per cent for most new and resale first-timer flat buyers taking on an HDB loan,"" Mr Lee added.
""This is well below the international benchmark of 30 to 35 per cent. This means that most first-timer buyers can service their housing loans using their monthly CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay.""
Mr Lee also recapped a number of measures announced last week which were aimed at cooling the property market.
These included some private home owners having to now wait 15 months after they sell their property before they can buy an HDB resale flat. In addition, maximum loan quantum limits have been tightened. For HDB loans, the LTV limit has been lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.
""These measures are necessary as property loans are long-term commitments and often a household’s largest liability. The higher floor rates ensure that today’s borrowers take loans that reflect the likelihood of rising interest rates and avoid overstretching themselves,"" said Mr Lee.
There is ""genuine demand"" from home buyers, said Mr Lee and the Government has also increased supply in both public and private housing markets.
He pointed out how HDB has ramped up BTO supply and is on track to launch 23,000 flats per year in 2022 and 2023, a 35 per cent increase from 2021.
""We are prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed. We also endeavour to launch more projects with shorter waiting times of less than three years where possible,"" Mr Lee added."
"Turf City tenants resigned to end of lease, but struggle to find new venues offering the same experience","They will have to move out by December 2023, with some having to leave even earlier from a site earmarked for new residences and an upcoming MRT station.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/turf-city-tenants-struggle-new-venue-2984961,"SINGAPORE: Riders Cafe at Turf City will move out of its premises in February 2023 - and may not reopen elsewhere.
Cafe owner Jan Yeo has yet to find an alternative venue ahead of the building’s lease expiring in December 2023, despite looking out for a year now.
The eatery is a sub-tenant of horse-riding school Bukit Timah Saddle Club, which has been asked to return part of its premises earlier - from the first half of 2023 - to support tunnelling works for the Cross Island MRT line.
The Singapore Government recently reminded tenants at Turf City's 140-hectare site - about the size of 200 football fields - that their leases would not be extended further after a second and final extension.

Property prices near new MRT stations on Cross Island Line expected to rise, higher en bloc potential: Analysts













The owner of Riders Cafe's - which has been at the same venue for 15 years - has been looking for a place that is “raw and natural”, with a similar vibe to Turf City, but has not found anything yet.
“So far, most places out there are quite pretty and fancy and a bit more manicured, so you don't get this this kampung feel anymore,” the nature lover told CNA.
""I don't think you can replicate this natural scenery and background. So, very likely we're going to have to just close, and probably take our time to find somewhere. Either that or we will just, you know, close indefinitely.”
“UNMATCHED” SPACE
While it did not come as a shock that the lease for the site - which has been slated for residential use since Singapore's 1998 Master Plan - will not be extended, it was still a “bummer”, said owner of The Cage Sports Park Rajesh Mulani.
“I suppose our simplistic way (of thinking) is: ‘We lost those two years. Just roll it (end of lease) back two years and at least we have a chance of recovering back what we have lost'.""
With this no longer possible, the end of his firm’s lease at Turf City has wider implications, said Mr Mulani.
“What I think is the bigger waste is the sporting lifestyle that we have helped to build,"" he explained, noting that roughly 100,000 people use the 10-hectare premises - about 18 football fields - every month for activities like soccer, tennis, and paintball.
“Our sports resources are very highly utilised. And now we've a critical mass of people who come actively and regularly to play sports, so you don't want to waste that momentum. So, for us, the hunt is on. We've got to figure out what and where next.”
Those who use the premises are anxious, wondering where they can take their games, Mr Mulani added.
But the search for a next venue has not been an easy one, given the kind of land space he requires. Current prices have also been kept affordable because the sports park is not housed in a commercial entity.
This space at Turf City is “unmatched”, said Mr Mulani.
“This, if you like, is a heart of sport. This is like a very, very big mega mall of sport.
""You've got like-minded people, like-minded energy, like-minded buzz and you feel like you're in another place ... That's going to be missed.""
UNOFFICIAL “SPORTS HUB”
Like Mr Mulani, Mr Gary Tan, chief executive of the Ronnie O’Sullivan Snooker Academy, has observed a vibrant sporting culture at Turf City.
The location is now seen as an unofficial “sports hub”, he said.
His academy, which has more than 600 members, offers snooker in a professional environment, which helps to shed its image as a sport played by delinquents, Mr Tan added.






      The Ronnie O'Sullivan Snooker Academy at Turf City opened in November last year. (Photo: Facebook/Ronnie O'Sullivan Snooker Academy)
    






He opened it just last November after sinking a few hundred thousand dollars into renovation, including resurfacing of floors.
“We thought that you know, we take a plunge and just hope it gets extended, and then we stay here for three years, six years,” said Mr Tan.
Despite renegotiating for a 40 per cent rental discount, he still expects to make a mid- to high-five-figure loss by the time his lease expires.
It is now back to the drawing board for Mr Tan, who thinks the Singapore Sports Hub could be a suitable next location.
The Turf City tenants said they have yet to be engaged by the Singapore Land Authority, but Riders Cafe owner Jan Yeo remains optimistic about what may come.
“Hopefully, in the future, if they do redevelop this area again and keep this building as part of another façade, maybe they will ask us if we want to run a restaurant here again,” said the long-time tenant.
For Mr Mulani, it is keeping the sporting culture that he is concerned about.
“We have built this momentum where people are playing regularly. I hope that doesn't get underestimated."""
"DBS, UOB and OCBC raise fixed rate home loans to as high as 3.85%","The latest adjustments mean that mortgage rates in Singapore are now likely at their highest since 2008, according to an industry expert.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dbs-uob-ocbc-raise-fixed-rate-home-loans-35-385-2984846,"SINGAPORE: Local lenders DBS, UOB and OCBC on Tuesday (Oct 4) raised their fixed rate home loans, with rates reaching as high as 3.85 per cent.
DBS, Singapore's largest lender, made the first move. A check of its website on Tuesday morning showed four fixed rate packages available, ranging from two to five years. All four are set at 3.5 per cent per annum.
DBS had previously removed all fixed rate mortgages from its website, as it conducted a review following another steep interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve last month.
The same fixed rate of 3.5 per cent also applies to its two-in-one home loans, which allows borrowers to structure up to half of their loan amount in fixed rates and the remainder under a floating rate package.
DBS last adjusted its home loan rates in end-June. Then, it raised the rates on its two-year and three-year fixed rate packages to 2.75 per cent per annum, while scrapping a five-year fixed-rate package for Housing Board flat buyers.
The bank also introduced a new home loan package last week, allowing new and existing owners of HDB flats earning less than S$2,500 a month to take up a mortgage with POSB at 2.6 per cent per annum. This rate is similar to that of a HDB housing loan.
“We are cognisant that home loans are one of the largest and longest financial commitments that greatly impact a customer’s cashflow. So we are doing more to help our customers to not just own their homes, but also capitalise on opportunities to accumulate cash while they save,” said a DBS spokesperson.
The bank's latest review is “in accordance with the interest rate environment” and its longer-tenure packages will benefit those looking to lock in a fixed interest rate for a longer period.
“The bank will continually explore ways to provide our customers more stability through our fixed rates packages programme,” the spokesperson added.
UOB, which was doing a similar review and had temporarily ceased its fixed rate offerings on Sep 23, told CNA on Tuesday afternoon that its two-year and three-year fixed rate home loan packages now bear per-annum interest rates of 3.75 per cent and 3.85 per cent, respectively.
This is up from 2.98 per cent and 3.08 per cent previously.
UOB also offers home loans that combine both fixed and floating rate packages. The all-in or blended rate of such a hybrid loan “tend(s) to be lower”, said its head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan.
For example, if borrowers take half of their loan amount on a two-year fixed rate package at the current rate of 3.75 per cent, and the other half on a floating rate package pegged to the three-month compounded SORA at an assumption of 2.09 per cent, the all-in rate will turn out to be 3.27 per cent, she said.
Such a hybrid loan package typically offers a fixed monthly repayment amount for a set period, while also allowing partial loan repayment for the floating rate portion without penalty.
“This means that when interest rates rise, customers can consider paying down the floating rate portion of their loan to avoid the incremental interest payments, while their fixed rate portion is protected against rising rates,” she added.
“We are continuously monitoring market conditions and will review our home loan packages to ensure they remain competitive,” Ms Tan told CNA in an emailed response.
In line with its peers, OCBC announced later in the day that it would be adjusting its two-year fixed rate package to a rate of 3.5 per cent, up from 2.98 per cent.
It is also re-introducing a one-year fixed rate mortgage of 3.35 per cent, citing demand for a shorter lock-in period among some customers.
“Some of these are customers who plan to sell their properties in the near future, while there are others who believe that interest rates may start to come off from end of next year,” said the bank's head of consumer secured lending Phang Lah Hwa.
“Given this trend in the market, we have decided to re-launch our one-year fixed-rate package, together with our two-year fixed-rate package, albeit at a higher rate due to the current interest environment.
“Our pricing packages strike the balance between offering customers stability and yet giving them wriggle room to sell their property or review their home loan when the opportunity or need arises,” she added.

FAQ: What home owners in Singapore need to know after another Fed rate hike













For now, all three banks have left their floating rate offerings pegged to the benchmark Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) unchanged.
DBS' floating rate loan remains at a three-month compounded SORA and a lending margin of 1 per cent per annum, with a two-year lock in period.
UOB is offering a floating rate pegged to the three-month compounded SORA, plus a margin of 0.7 per cent per annum for the first two years, and 0.8 per cent for the third year onwards.
Meanwhile, OCBC's floating rate loans are pegged to the one-month and three-month compounded SORA plus a margin of 0.98 per cent for the first 2 years.
The three-month compounded SORA has risen from 0.1949 at the start of the year to 2.0851 as of Oct 3.
HIGHEST SINCE 2008
Still, the latest adjustments in fixed rate loans mean that mortgage rates in Singapore are now likely at their highest since 2008, according to SingCapital's chief executive Alfred Chia.
Then, mortgage rates were likely at 4 per cent before the global financial crisis hit. The latest rates are also below what home owners in Singapore had to pay in the 1980s and 1990s, when home loan rates hovered around 5 to 6 per cent, said Mr Chia.
Central banks around the world have been tightening monetary policy to combat surging inflation.
The US Federal Reserve, in particular, has been on a rate-hike race to combat inflation at its highest in 40 years. Its latest move – a 75-basis-point rate increase on Sep 21 – marks its fifth rate hike this year, with further increases likely, to rein in soaring prices.
Amid this, banks have been making rapid revisions to their borrowing rates.
“Singapore's interest rates follow closely that in the US. With the Federal Reserve already hiking their rates and openly indicating that they will increase further, the banks are acting in anticipation of these higher rates,” Mr Chia said.
But the lenders may be reined in by competition for now, given how rates have not breached 4 per cent, he added.
Explaining why fixed rate home loan packages have seen bigger adjustments so far, Mr Paul Wee, vice-president of PropertyGuru Finance at PropertyGuru Group, said: “Banks must cover or hedge their exposures against rising interest rates when offering a fixed rate package. The closer the fixed rates are to the current interest rates, the higher the cost of hedging.
“The hawkish stance taken by the US Fed means that it is unclear how high interest rates can go.” 
On the other hand, hedging is not applicable to floating rate packages as the higher rates are passed on to consumers, he added.
Meanwhile, the Singapore Government unveiled a slew of property cooling measures last week, in its bid to moderate demand and ensure prudent borrowing.
The measures, which came into effect on Sep 30, include revised medium-term interest rate floors, a higher interest rate floor for housing loans granted by HDB, as well as a wait-out period of 15 months for private home owners to buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.
These rule tweaks serve as a timely reminder to home owners at a time when higher rates are likely here to stay, Mr Chia said.
“I think interest rates are normalising and will stay (this way) for some time ... so the latest measure is a good reminder to home owners - make sure you can afford your home loans.”

'Bogus allegations' about government expenditure: Indranee in rebuttal to NCMP Leong Mun Wai's motion,"Mr Leong, the NCMP from Progress Singapore Party, had questioned the financial reasoning behind the Government’s decision to provide funding support for SPH Media Trust and the cost involved in taking over Sports Hub.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bogus-allegations-government-indranee-rajah-leong-mun-wai-2983271,"SINGAPORE: Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai’s adjournment motion included “bogus allegations” about how the Government manages public funds, said Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah in Parliament on Monday (Oct 3).
Mr Leong, the NCMP from Progress Singapore Party, had questioned the financial reasoning behind the Government’s decision to provide funding support for SPH Media Trust and the cost involved in taking over the ownership and management of Sports Hub.
He described them in his speech for the adjournment motion as “two significant outlays of taxpayer's money”, and reminders of the need to ensure “better oversight of public expenditures”.
The Government has said it will provide up to S$900 million in funding support for SPH Media Trust over the next five years, after media operations of Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) were hived off last year to form a not-for-profit entity.
On terminating the public-private partnership (PPP) for the Sports Hub, authorities have said a large portion of its costs - about S$1.5 billion - will be the amount paid to Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL), the private consortium that was previously running the sports facility, for the termination. This amount comprises S$300 million for the fair market value of Sports Hub and S$1.2 billion that can be understood as the capital expenditure the Government would have had to bear if it adopted the traditional procurement approach from the start.
“This is a total of S$2.4 billion of taxpayer's money,” said Mr Leong, adding that the Government “owes Singaporeans a more detailed explanation”.
“The Government must respond in full to my queries or Singaporeans can take it that taxpayer’s money has been wasted,” he said.
In her response, Ms Indranee described the NCMP’s allegations about the Government’s management of public expenditure and objections to the transactions involving Sports Hub and SPH Media Trust as “completely without basis”. 
She noted that the Government has responded “in full many times” on these two issues.
“Mr Leong’s entire motion is an attempt to portray the Government as profligate and heedless of our expenses. Nothing could be further from the truth,” she said.
“In persisting with these insinuations, Mr Leong is doing a disservice to Singapore, to our Government and to our public servants, charged with the sacred responsibility of looking after the public purse.”
A WASTE OF TAXPAYERS’ MONEY: LEONG MUN WAI
Mr Leong said in his near 20-minute-long speech that the restructuring deal involving SPH is “questionable”, as the company's shareholders “should have left behind a larger share of (its) property assets to support” the operations of SPH Media Trust.
These assets include shopping malls such as Paragon, which were acquired by SPH using profits from its print media business previously, he noted. These non-media assets have since been sold to Cuscaden Peak – a consortium comprising tycoon Ong Beng Seng’s Hotel Properties and two Temasek-linked entities – for S$3.9 billion after the restructuring.
Yet, “only S$110 million of cash and shares were left behind to fund the loss-making media business”, Mr Leong said.
“Since the property assets were accumulated over the years with media profits, it is reasonable to expect that more than S$110 million should have been left behind,” he noted, adding that it “makes no business sense” for the Government to have agreed to the restructuring proposal.

Turning to the termination of the public-private partnership for the Sports Hub, the NCMP said while he supports the takeover decision, he noted that the Government has been “overly generous” in estimating the Sports Hub’s fair market value and remaining financial liabilities.
Arguing why he thinks the authorities should not have to compensate the sports facility’s market value, he said: “If this market value is based on the Sports Hubs’ name value, the name value has primarily come from the Sports Hub being a national icon carrying the branding of the National Stadium and occupy the site of many of our national memories, like the Kallang Roar.”
But SHPL did not pay the Government for the value of this branding when it constructed the Sports Hub, Mr Leong added.
“Therefore, there’s no need for the Government to compensate SHPL for this name value now, as SHPL has failed to transform the Sports Hub into a leading venue for local and international events. It is also not justifiable to say SHPL has increased the value of the Sports Hub since its completion.”
Mr Leong also described the S$1.2 billion in outstanding financial liabilities as “too high”.
Noting that S$125 million – about 65 per cent of the Government’s annual fee payments to SHPL – go towards repaying debt each year, he said that would imply a loan interest rate of “more than 8 per cent a year” if one assumes that the billion-dollar bill of building the Sports Hub was fully financed and debt repayment is constant from 2014 to 2035.
This interest rate is “way too high” based on market conditions in 2010 when construction began, Mr Leong argued, adding that an interest rate of 4 per cent would be “more in line” with then-conditions. 
Based on that, he estimated that the annual financing payments should come up to only about S$90 million a year, instead of S$125 million. The outstanding loan principal should have also been reduced to about S$920 million by end-2022 after nine years of repayment, instead of S$1.2 billion.
The NCMP also posited the possibility of SHPL having accumulated surpluses from the Government’s annual fee payments due to lower debt repayments, which he estimated to be S$320 million.
“To sum up, I have estimated an outstanding loan of S$920 million and total accumulated reserves of S$320 million. Hence, the Government should only be paying the difference between the two amounts, which is S$600 million as outstanding financial liabilities to SHPL,” he said.
“I’m worried that the Government's behaviour in commercial deals can potentially lead to a waste of taxpayers’ money,” Mr Leong added.

ASSERTIONS “WITHOUT BASIS”: INDRANEE
Ms Indranee, in her rebuttal, said Mr Leong’s speech include assertions made “without basis” and that the Government has already responded to the two issues “in full many times”, including ministerial statements delivered in Parliament.
On the takeover of Sports Hub, she noted that Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong had laid out reasons for the termination, benefits of the public-private partnership (PPP) approach and the basis behind the termination sum of S$1.5 billion in his ministerial statement on Aug 1.
“The termination sum is derived based on a formula stipulated in the project agreement. Most of it is made up of the capital expenditure, which the Government would have had to bear if we had opted for the traditional procurement model,” said Ms Indranee.
“Minister Edwin had also explained that the full cost of termination is comparable to the financial obligation that we would have had to pay under the PPP, if we had chosen to continue with it.
“In other words, the entire transaction is financially neutral, because we are not paying SHPL more than what we would otherwise have committed to under the PPP model,” she added.
“Unfortunately, Mr Leong has chosen to ignore these detailed explanations, and instead makes a completely baseless and false claim that the termination sum can be lower.”
Likewise, questions raised by Mr Leong regarding SPH Media Trust have also been addressed by two Ministers for Communications and Information – Minister S Iswaran in a ministerial statement last May, followed by Minister Josephine Teo during the ministry’s Committee of Supply debate earlier this year.
The Government has said that its support will allow SPH Media Trust to “make long-term investments in capability development” such as in the areas of technology and talent.
“This is needed to sustain and develop our local news media and ensure that we have a trusted, credible source of news and information for Singaporeans,” said Ms Indranee, adding that support is also necessary for vernacular print media which play a crucial role in preserving the country’s mother tongues and cultural inheritance.
At the same time, the media industry, not just Singapore, faces the challenge of falling revenues amid the rise of digital content platforms and new avenues for free content.
On the NCMP’s claim that SPH’s shareholders could have paid more, Ms Indranee pointed to Mrs Teo’s earlier response that if the restructuring involved a contribution higher than S$110 million, “the shareholders could have walked away”.
“Mr Leong fails to recognise the realities facing the media industry in the real world and that if we were to do as he suggests, it will leave SPH Media on a trajectory of decline and eventually result in a Singapore without a viable English-language domestic media and without our Chinese, Malay and Tamil media, which is not in our national interests,” she added.
Reiterating that the NCMP’s allegations are “completely without basis”, Ms Indranee said: “I ask Members of this House and Singaporeans not to be taken in, but to reject these bogus allegations and to support the Government.
“Then we can continue to sustain good governance and sound policies for the benefit of all Singaporeans, especially to take care of our elderly and to support the disadvantaged and vulnerable members of our society.”"
"More landslides reported in 2020, 2021 amid higher-than-normal rainfall: Desmond Lee",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/more-landslides-reported-2020-2021-amid-higher-normal-rainfall-desmond-lee-clementi-bto-2983281,"SINGAPORE: More landslides were reported over the last two years compared to previous years, possibly due to higher-than-normal rainfall, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said on Monday (Oct 3) in response to a parliamentary question. 
An average of 21 landslides were reported per year in 2020 and 2021.
This is higher than the average of four such incidents reported to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) each year between 2017 and 2019.
""These were all relatively minor cases involving the movement of shallow layers of soil, and did not cause significant damage to infrastructure,"" Mr Lee said in a written answer to questions from Member of Parliament He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang).
""Higher-than-normal rainfall was recorded in 2020 and 2021, which could be one factor that contributed to the higher number of incidents in these two years.""
For this year, one landslide has been reported to BCA so far - the incident at the Clementi NorthArc Build-to-Order construction site on Sep 2.
""This was caused by slope failure, which refers to the sudden collapse of a slope due to changes in soil strength or the destabilisation of the slope,"" Mr Lee said.
""BCA has inspected the surrounding buildings and found them to be structurally sound. The cause of this incident is currently being investigated.""

Another section of Ulu Pandan park connector to reopen after Clementi landslide but flood risk remains: HDB













Ms He had asked about the number of landslides reported in the preceding five years, how often and under what circumstances the stability of land close to building or deforestation sites is reviewed and assessed, and if any update is required to the monitoring and rectification regime for landslides.
Noting that the movement of soil can be triggered by factors such as heavy and prolonged rainfall, additional loads on slopes and changes to slope profiles due to construction work, Mr Lee outlined the current framework in place to prevent landslides.
""Agencies that manage public land carry out regular inspections on slopes that may pose a risk to public safety, and implement appropriate mitigation measures to stabilise the slopes as needed,"" he said.
""Our agencies may also conduct inspections more frequently, such as on a weekly or monthly basis, during periods of intense wet weather.""
BCA also requires all slopes that are formed or modified by building works to be assessed for risk of failure by a qualified person (QP) before construction commences, he added.
""The QP is required to recommend slope protection measures to be put in place, such as earth retaining walls and stabilising structures, to ensure that the slope remains stable under adverse weather conditions, including extreme rainfall,"" Mr Lee said.
""The QP is also required to recommend measures to monitor the condition of the slope while works are ongoing.
""The frequency of monitoring may vary depending on the complexity of the works. For example, slopes may be monitored twice a week for relatively shallow excavation works, and daily for works in close proximity to other buildings.""
As a precautionary measure following the Sep 2 slope failure incident, BCA reminded qualified persons and builders to inspect slopes on or adjacent to construction sites, and to take additional measures as needed to ensure that these slopes remain stable, Mr Lee said.
""BCA also issues regular advisories to remind land and building owners to implement measures to manage the risk of landslides for their slopes,"" he added.
""These include ensuring adequate drainage and proper maintenance of slope- and earth-retaining structures.""
He added that BCA will review the cause of the Sep 2 landslide after investigations have been completed, and assess if additional measures are required to ensure the safety of slopes on or near construction sites.
The landslide last month injured one passer-by, caused ""soil displacement"" into Sungei Ulu Pandan and damaged part of the Ulu Pandan park connector.
Parts of the park connector were closed temporarily following the incident, and a channel had to be created to allow water to flow through the affected section of the canal."
"HDB says it will continue to refine barrier-free parking system after feedback about app, season lots","The barrier-free parking system was implemented at two car parks near Old Airport Road Food Centre in September, as part of trials that started in Punggol in 2021.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-barrier-free-parking-system-improve-system-feedback-app-season-parking-lots-2983051,"SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Monday (Oct 3) that it will continue to refine its barrier-free parking system after receiving feedback from motorists about payment via the Parking@HDB app as well as identifying season parking lots. 
The barrier-free parking system was implemented last month at two car parks near Old Airport Road Food Centre, as part of trials that started in Punggol in January 2021.
Car parks with the smart parking system no longer have gantry barriers at the entrance and exit, as vehicle licence plates are registered via cameras. 
To help motorists search for parking lots, colour-coded LED indicators were installed above every parking lot at the multi-storey car park at Old Airport Road to show their availability.
Green indicates that the lots are available for short-term parking, while amber means the lots are reserved for season parking.
PAYMENT OF PARKING CHARGES
Some motorists have asked why there is a need for a separate payment app - the Parking@HDB app - instead of using the national Parking.sg app.
With the Parking@HDB app, a parking session will start automatically via the app when a vehicle enters the car park and ends when it leaves. 
Parking charges will be paid automatically via credit or debit card through the app. The idea is that motorists do not need to worry about inserting their cash cards into the In-vehicle Unit (IU) or worry about insufficient funds.
In response to CNA's queries, HDB said on Monday that it will look into integrating the Parking@HDB app with parking.sg subsequently when the new parking system is rolled out to more car parks islandwide.
""As we are conducting a trial of the barrierless parking system, an app separate from the Parking.sg app would allow us to make quick modifications to refine the system, in response to ground operations and feedback, without causing any interference to the existing functions of the Parking.sg app,"" the agency explained.
While motorists who park short-term are encouraged to download the Parking@HDB app and set up an account, those who don't can still pay their parking charges via the cash card in their vehicle IU, similar to existing car parks with the Electronic Parking System (EPS), said HDB.
""Motorists of foreign vehicles are similarly able to pay for parking charges by downloading the Parking@HDB app and linking it to their credit/debit cards. Those who do not have the app can insert their CEPAS and NETS cards in their IU to pay for their parking charges,"" it added.

IDENTIFYING PARKING LOTS
Another motorist noted that with the implementation of colour-coded LED lights to signal short-term parking or season parking, the markings on the ground have all been painted white - which usually indicates that they are for short-term parking.
""When the lot is empty, such lights are useful because orange light would mean that its a season parking lot,"" said Facebook user Natsem Vad.
""But when the car park is full and vehicles are waiting for lots, they have no idea which lots are normal and which lots are reserved for season parking because the light above the lot would be switched off.""
HDB said those car parks in question are those in the Build-to-Order projects in Punggol Northshore. 
""The use of the colour-coded LED overhead indicator lights will allow us to dynamically change the use of the lots from short-term parking to season parking and vice versa, depending on the needs of motorists at the car park,"" HDB said on Monday.
""Hence, the lots were painted white in order to keep their use flexible.
""The dynamic allocation of parking lots will be available at a later stage of the trials, as HDB will need time to study parking demand to obtain the aggregated demand for the parking lots.""
The agency noted that the season parking lots at the Old Airport Road car parks remain painted red. 
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES INFORMED OF THE NEW SYSTEM
Before starting trials, HDB said it will keep residents and shop tenants in the area informed of the new parking system via circulars and other publicity materials.  
For instance, information on Parking@HDB was placed on the tables at the Old Airport Road Market and Food Centre. Posters were also put up at the lift lobbies of HDB blocks to inform residents of the new parking system.
Additionally, banners were displayed at the car parks and staff were deployed to explain the system to the motorists, said HDB. 
Following feedback from motorists, HDB said it has put up more signs in the car parks to notify users of the season parking hours. 
""We will continue to review our efforts in familiarising motorists with the new parking system,"" said the agency.
""As we continue to refine the system, we invite motorists to send their feedback and suggestions to DigitalParking [at] hdb.gov.sg."""
"Crocodile seen near walking path in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, NParks advises public to keep a distance","The National Parks Board said that it received a report of the crocodile on Sep 30 and that its staff visited the site to check and monitor the situation. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/crocodile-beside-walking-path-sungei-buloh-separated-wooden-fence-nparks-advice-keep-distance-2982876,"SINGAPORE: A man who was trekking in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve was shocked to see a crocodile resting just beside the foot trail he was on last Friday (Sep 30) afternoon. 
The only thing that had separated Mr Matthew Kwa from the saltwater crocodile, which he estimated to be about 3m to 4m in length, was a wooden fence that the National Parks Board (NParks) had extended in 2018 precisely to keep the reptiles from climbing onto pathways.
“It stayed there motionless for the entire time. I spotted it while trekking and happened to notice it,” said Mr Kwa, who encountered the reptile at about 1.20pm. 
According to Mr Kwa, the crocodile was near observation Hide 1C, a shelter along the trail he was on. 
Mr Kwa, who works in the IT industry, took out his phone to snap some pictures. He posted the photos on Facebook group Singapore Wildlife Sightings, where it has since garnered more than 1,000 reactions. 
“The only time when I read about crocs near the trail was before they build the fence and crocs could easily cross over the trail. Anyone would feel stunned encountering it up close,” he said. 
""(I) kept an eye on it while moving forward because nobody could be 100 per cent sure the fence would be able to stop the crocodile.""






      The crocodile remained motionless and had not crossed onto the pathway when it was spotted on Sep 30. (Photo: Matthew Kwa)
    






Responding to CNA’s queries about the crocodile sighting, NParks Group Director of Conservation, Lim Liang Jim said that NParks received a report that an Estuarine Crocodile was sighted behind the fence of a path at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve on Sep 30. 
“NParks staff visited the site to check on the sighting, remained on-site to monitor the situation, and advised members of the public to keep a distance,” Mr Lim said. 
“NParks staff actively patrol during the high tide, where crocodiles are often seen on land. The path is segregated by a fence which acts as a deterrence for crocodiles who might come up to the foot path to bask, move between waterbodies or rest during high tide. Crocodiles, like all wildlife, generally do not attack unless they are provoked."" 
He added that such crocodiles occur naturally in the wild in Singapore. They feed and rest in brackish and freshwater areas and are usually found in the water or on mudflats away from visitor routes. The crocodiles hunt mainly at night and feed mostly on fish. The cold-blooded creatures rely on external sources of heat, such as the sun, to warm up and hence usually come onto land to bask in the sun. 
According to the NParks' website, the Estuarine Crocodile, also known as the Saltwater Crocodile, is one of the largest crocodile species in the world and can grow to more than 5m in length.
It has a long snout and a broad, muscular tail with ridges. While crocodiles may appear bulky and clumsy, they can move very quickly over short distances, both on land and in water. They can become aggressive and attack, especially when provoked, whether on land or in water.
Mr Lim said that in event of a crocodile encounter, members of the public should remain calm and stay a good distance away from the animal, and not approach, provoke or feed it. 
“Warning signs and advisory notices have been posted at areas where these animals are most often seen.
""Visitors should heed these signs, which advise the public to stay on the visitor routes and not venture off the designated paths.”

NParks to manage consultants for environmental impact assessments of nature-sensitive projects













Crocodiles have been spotted in various parts of the reserve over the years.
In 2018, a 2m-long crocodile was spotted by visitors in the middle of a pathway, according to a report by the Straits Times. Visitors had to wait for up to half an hour before the reptile made its way into the bushes.
The crocodile sightings prompted NParks to extend a barricade along the pathway to prevent the crocodiles from climbing onto trails. NParks said then that it would set up a motion-activated camera to monitor the situation.
Responding to CNA queries, the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) said that it has received four to five cases involving crocodiles in the past decade. However these are crocodiles that needed rescue after straying into private property such as golf courses and farms. A spokesperson said that crocodiles often come out of the water to bask and lay eggs. 
“Visitorship to our nature reserves have increased in the past few years, most likely due to COVID-19 and travel restrictions. I think that through this, awareness of our local biodiversity has also increased with more people knowing about wildlife which is great news.""
""However, as more people visit our parks and reserves, we suggest that first time visitors find out more about the place they are visiting to better prepare themselves. When we enter a nature reserve, we are in nature and awareness of our surroundings are important,” added the ACRES spokesperson. 
The spokesperson also advised the public not to bring pets, keep an eye on children and not let them run around, and be vigilant of signs that warn of the wildlife and their crossings. Visitors are also advised to keep food in air-tight containers and hidden in a bag.
The public may also contact NParks’ 24-hour Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600 or Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve at 67941401 to report any encounter.

CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?













Amid rising return rates, the Singapore Savings Bonds have been receiving keen interest from investors in search of safety amid volatile times. The bond's latest average 10-year return surpasses the interest rates offered by banks on fixed deposits, which have also been on the rise amid a rising rate environment.
The interest rates of each Singapore Savings Bond issuance are based on the average SGS yields in the month before applications open. These yields have been on an uptrend like all other major economies’ bond yields, as global central banks raise interest rates.
The previous record for the 10-year average return was set in August, when the return rate touched 3 per cent. That issue received applications worth S$2.4 billion, far outstripping the S$700 million worth of bonds issued.
As a result, the quantity ceiling - applied when applications exceed the issuance size - for the August tranche was S$9,000, much lower than earlier issuances.
For this latest tranche which will be issued on Nov 1, the maximum amount offered is S$900 million, according to MAS’ website where issue details are made known monthly.
Interest will be paid every six months on Nov 1 and May 1 until the savings bond matures in 2032.
Applications for the November tranche will open at 6pm on Monday and close at 9pm on Oct 26. 
Investment amounts start from S$500 and can be made via cash or one's Supplementary Retirement Scheme funds. A S$2 transaction fee applies for each application.

"More than 90% of doctors under MOHH are local, says holding company of public healthcare clusters","The holding company of Singapore’s public healthcare clusters posted a tender last month, indicating its intention to recruit doctors from India, a move that sparked online debate.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mohh-tender-recruit-doctors-india-local-singaporeans-2982491,"SINGAPORE: More than 90 per cent of doctors employed by MOH Holdings (MOHH), the holding company of Singapore’s public healthcare clusters, are local.
These comprise graduates from three local medical schools and returning Singaporeans who pursued overseas medical studies at recognised universities.
MOHH’s statement comes after a tender issued by the company on Sep 6 found its way to social media platforms, sparking online debate.
The ongoing tender, which will close on Oct 10, is for a recruitment agency to provide services to recruit doctors from India to work as medical officers in Singapore. This includes looking for viable candidates as well as participating and assisting with MOHH’s recruitment trips to India.
According to tender documents posted on the company’s website, MOHH intends to recruit 60 medical officers from India per year from now till 2024, with the option of a one-year extension. 
Alternative news site The Online Citizen had also published an article about it, which raised concerns about alleged incidents of fraud and scandals in India’s medical education system.
Responding to media queries from CNA, a company spokesperson said MOHH has been recruiting qualified doctors from other countries such as the UK and Australia to supplement its overall capacity needs and to help reduce the heavy workload of existing doctors. 
It added that its priority is to recruit locals from the medical schools recognised by the Singapore Medical Council.

MOHH said it recruits about 700 junior doctors each year, adding that it has increased its ""local pipeline"" over the years.
Between 2012 and 2019, Singapore’s medical schools increased their combined intakes by 45 per cent from 350 in 2012 to about 510 in 2019, said the company’s spokesperson.
The schools admitted another 40 medical students each year in 2020 and 2021 to cater to students whose overseas medical studies were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We size the intake of our local universities, based on the need of the healthcare sector, and also the admission standards of the Universities,” said MOHH.
“Naturally, this means that places in medical schools are highly sought after, admission is very competitive, but on the other hand, graduates from our medical school are very highly regarded.”
The company spokesperson added that doctors who are recruited from overseas must have graduated from medical schools which are on the Second Schedule of the Medical Registration Act.
“These doctors will only be granted conditional registration for clinical practice and under strict supervision,” the company’s spokesperson said.
“They may eventually convert to full registration if they remain in good standing and have favourable supervisory reports attesting to their professionalism and competency.”
“Regardless of nationality, we value the contributions of each and every single doctor to Singapore and our healthcare system,” the spokesperson added."
New wildlife park Bird Paradise to open in second quarter of 2023,"Bird Paradise will be home to 3,500 birds from more than 400 species.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-bird-paradise-mandai-wildlife-reserve-open-second-quarter-2023-2982326,"SINGAPORE: Bird Paradise, the new bird park at Mandai Wildlife Reserve, is set to open in the second quarter of 2023.
Spanning 17ha, it will be the first of two new wildlife parks located at Mandai Wildlife Reserve to open to the public, said Mandai Wildlife Group in a media release on Monday (Oct 3).
Bird Paradise will be home to 3,500 birds from more than 400 species, with eight walk-through aviaries representing different biomes around the world including African rainforests, South American wetlands, Southeast Asian paddy fields and Australian dry eucalypt forests.
These aviaries have been named Heart of Africa, Wings of Asia, Crimson Wetlands, Amazonian Jewels, Songs of the Forest, Mysterious Papua, Australian Outback and Lory Loft.
The new bird park will also feature an avian conservation section called the Winged Sanctuary. It will house critically endangered species such as the Philippine eagle, the Vietnam pheasant and the Negros bleeding-heart.

Group CEO of Mandai Wildlife Group Mike Barclay said: ""When the Mandai Rejuvenation Project was envisioned, we wanted Bird Paradise to exemplify our commitment to operating open, immersive wildlife parks that place animal welfare at the centre of what we do.""
""The support facilities are also of the highest standard, including a state-of-the-art avian hospital and an extensive breeding facility,"" he added.
Bird Paradise will also provide the group with a platform to further its education programmes, capacity-building initiatives and work to protect threatened bird species across the region, he said.
As part of a sustainability push throughout the precinct, Mandai Wildlife Group said that Bird Paradise will be applying to be certified under the Landscape Excellence Assessment Framework.
It will install rooftop solar panels where space is available and incorporate ""passive design to achieve thermal comfort and avoid glare in the large visitor spaces"".
""More than 5,000 trees have also been planted throughout the park to recreate natural habitats and provide shade for visitors,"" the group said, adding that energy-efficient hybrid ventilation systems would be used to replace air-conditioning where possible.
""For areas where air-conditioning is required, water and energy-saving measures will be implemented, allowing spaces such as Penguin Cove to achieve the Green Mark Platinum for non-residential buildings.""

Coroner rules medical misadventure in case of woman who died after wisdom teeth extraction,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coroner-rules-medical-misadventure-case-24-year-old-woman-died-wisdom-teeth-extraction-2982461,"SINGAPORE: A woman died aged 24 following the extraction of four wisdom teeth after experiencing a rare case of malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening reaction that occurs due to certain agents used during general anaesthesia.
In findings made available on Monday (Oct 3), a coroner ruled the death of Ms Toh Yi Lin an unfortunate medical misadventure.
The court heard that Ms Toh was first seen at the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) on Aug 8, 2018, after being referred there from Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. During a review at the NDCS on Apr 23, 2019, she complained of severe, radiating pain in the upper and lower right side of her mouth.
Examinations suggested that the pain could be due to an impacted wisdom tooth or a necrotic tooth. Ms Toh also had three other impacted wisdom teeth which were assessed to potentially cause more pain, swelling and infection.
Ms Toh chose to undergo surgery under general anaesthesia to remove her four impacted wisdom teeth. She had no known drug allergy and had undergone two uneventful surgeries under general anaesthesia previously.
On May 8, 2019, Ms Toh was admitted to a ward and a nurse ran through a checklist to assess her general condition, drug allergies and other facets of her medical history. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted, and the anaesthetist for the surgery went through a pre-anaesthetic assessment with Ms Toh.
At about 8.20am, Ms Toh was taken into the operating theatre. The anaesthetist took a set of vital signs before administering the general anaesthesia and they were normal.
After Ms Toh went to sleep, she was intubated through the nose, a standard intubating procedure for dental surgery. The oral and maxillofacial surgeon performed the surgery and removed all four impacted wisdom teeth.
The surgery was uneventful for the first 90 minutes. However, just before the surgery was completed between 10am and 10.15am, Ms Toh showed signs of mild hypercapnia, or a rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide.
The surgery was completed at 10.20am and the operation sites sutured, with the anaesthetic gas discontinued. Ms Toh's mild hypercapnia began increasing in severity and she showed reduced oxygen saturation.
She was given oxygen ventilation, but did not wake up at 10.30am despite discontinuation of the anaesthetic gas, and had a fever of 42 degrees Celsius. Another anaesthetist came to help, and an ambulance was called for.
Despite efforts to resuscitate Ms Toh, she died at 1.31pm that same day.
An autopsy certified her cause of death as consistent with malignant hyperthermia. This is a life-threatening reaction that occurs due to certain anaesthetic agents used during general anaesthesia, including inhaled anaesthetic agents or succinylcholine. It can occur after a single exposure or multiple exposures and may manifest at any time during anaesthesia.
It usually manifests as elevated carbon dioxide levels, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia or raised body temperature and tachycardia. Individuals can be more susceptible to malignant hyperthermia due to certain inherited genetic mutations.
No other anatomical or toxicological causes of death were detected.
During the coroner's inquiry, the dental officer at NDCS who reviewed Ms Toh answered the question of whether it was appropriate for Ms Toh to remove all four wisdom teeth at one go instead of one or two at a time.
Dr Jody Hong stated that a dentist recommends the removal of teeth that have clinical indication for removal. She explained that she had a discussion with Ms Toh and her mother on the option of removing the four teeth.
She explained that if a patient was planning to remove all four wisdom teeth eventually and was keen on general anaesthesia, she would usually advise the patient to consider doing it in one surgery rather than go through general anaesthesia multiple times, as it comes with its own set of risks.
With Ms Toh, Dr Hong told her she had the choice of using local or general anaesthesia. She also explained the general risks of wisdom tooth surgery, which include the risk of permanent numbness to the lip, chin and tongue.
Ms Toh chose to remove all four wisdom teeth under general anaesthesia after discussing her options with her mother, after mentioning she had previously had surgery under general anaesthesia.
Based on Ms Toh's pre-anaesthetic assessment on the day of the surgery, she had past medical history of high cholesterol, a high Body Mass Index of 30.5 with a weight of 73.5kg and hidradenitis suppurativa, a skin condition. There was no family history of malignant hyperthermia.
Dr Diana Chan Xin Hui, the anaesthetist for Ms Toh's surgery, stated that malignant hyperthermia is a very rare inherited condition due to a gene mutation where there is an adverse response to the inhaled anaesthetic agents.
It causes widespread muscle breakdown and severe physiological dysfunction, causing the heart muscles to break down once it reaches the heart. While it is a rare condition, the death rate is high due to the severity of the reaction. This is a genetic disease occurring 1 in 50,000 in Western populations and is even rarer in Asians, said Dr Chan.
A independent medical expert found that pre-surgical screening was carried out appropriately. The response to the complications arising at the end of the surgery was also adequate and in accordance with established protocols for such cases.
The coroner said there is no basis to suspect foul play and conveyed her condolences to Ms Toh's family for their loss."
UOB raises promotional interest rates for fixed deposits to as high as 3%,"This latest move means that interest rates on fixed deposits in Singapore have hit their highest in almost 24 years.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/uob-raises-promotional-interest-rates-fixed-deposits-high-3-2982381,"SINGAPORE: United Overseas Bank (UOB) on Monday (Oct 3) raised its promotional interest rates for Singapore-dollar fixed deposits to as high as 3 per cent per annum for a 15-month duration.
This is up from last month’s promotional rate of 2.8 per cent.
The bank, Singapore’s third-largest lender, is also offering a higher rate of 2.9 per cent for a 12-month fixed deposit, up from 2.6 per cent.
Its 10-month promotion is going at 2.8 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent previously.
Customers will have to put in fresh funds of at least S$20,000 to enjoy the latest promotional rates.
A fixed deposit, otherwise known as a time or term deposit, allows one to earn a guaranteed amount of interest for a lump sum of money deposited with a bank over a specified duration.
Unlike regular savings accounts, customers cannot withdraw this money before the so-called “lock-in” duration is over - or they risk paying a penalty or losing the interest earned.
Banks here have been dangling increasingly juicy deals for fixed deposits in recent months, as central banks around the world hike interest rates.
The latest move by UOB means that the interest rate on 12-month fixed deposits has hit its highest in almost 24 years.
The last time interest rates on 12-month fixed deposits went above 2.9 per cent – UOB’s current promotional rate – was in November 1998, when the rate stood at 3.11 per cent, according to data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
That same month, three-month and six-month fixed deposit rates hit 2.95 per cent and 3.05 per cent respectively. The data from MAS does not track rates for 15-month fixed deposits.
For most of the past 20 years, fixed deposit rates in Singapore have been stuck below 1 per cent.

Banks in Singapore raise fixed deposit rates as demand surges for safe returns



















Beyond Singapore Savings Bonds and fixed deposits, what other low-risk investments are there?



















CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?













Recent revisions by lenders are part of a “natural progression with rising loan rates and inflation”, an expert had earlier told CNA.
“Banks are looking to improve visibility of their cost of funds and duration amidst further expected interest rate hikes,” said Maybank Securities’ head of research in Singapore Thilan Wickramasinghe.
Foreign banks are usually more aggressive in jostling for deposits as their smaller deposit bases mean they need to balance liquidity and cost of funding visibility in a rising rate environment.
But in light of stiff competition, domestic banks, which enjoy a large pool of funds from domestic customers and seldom dole out attractive offers, have also had to ramp up their game.
“The domestic banks have larger deposit bases however, they will also need to be nimble and respond to competition in order to defend market share,” said Mr Wickramasinghe.
UOB has been among the more aggressive of the banks, adjusting its fixed-deposit promotions monthly and offering one of the highest rates across a variety of tenor options so far.
The bank said its fixed deposit volume tripled in September, compared with the month before.
“Given the persistent high interest rate climate, we have decided to further increase our promotional fixed deposit rates, to present our customers a safe, principle-protected hedge against inflation and volatility,” said the UOB’s head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan.
The bank on Monday also raised promotional interest rates for customers with privilege accounts, from 1.9 per cent in September to 2.3 per cent for fresh fund deposits of between S$200,000 to S$3 million."
"'Not zero-sum game': Careful balance needed for foreign manpower policies, says Tan See Leng",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/foreign-manpower-labour-policies-tan-see-leng-parliament-2982131,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is an attractive place for companies to do business, resulting in good jobs and careers for Singaporeans, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Monday (Oct 3).
Conversely, companies may exit Singapore if they do not have access to the complementary foreign manpower they need, taking the jobs for Singaporeans with them, Dr Tan said.
""When it comes to foreign workforce policies, the way to advance it is to strike a very careful, as well as a very delicate balance,"" said the minister.
Replying to parliamentary questions from Members of Parliament, Dr Tan, who had delivered a ministerial statement on changes to Singapore's foreign manpower policies last month, was responding to several additional questions from MPs on the issue.
This focus in foreign manpower comes in the wake of Singapore reopening its borders after the COVID-19 pandemic, and Dr Tan's recent announcement of a new work pass for global top talent.

Singapore to launch new work pass for top talent in all sectors from 2023













""Being open, being connected, and bringing in complementary global talent, has helped to grow the overall pie for Singapore and more good job opportunities for locals,"" Dr Tan emphasised.
Ms Jessica Tan's (PAP - East Coast) had asked if there is data to show that Singaporeans are getting quality jobs in key sectors, while Mr Liang Eng Hwa (PAP - Bukit Panjang) had asked about the number of Employment Pass holders in the Information & Communications (ICT) sector, compared to other sectors.
Dr Tan said that more locals are in higher-skilled jobs for Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs), and there has been ""sustained wage growth"" for local workers.
He cited figures showing how the proportion of resident workers in PMET jobs has increased - from 55 per cent in 2016 to 62 per cent in 2021. He also said the median income of full-time employed residents has grown from S$4,100 to S$4,700 in those years, an increase in real wages of 2.1 per cent a year.
Wages for lower-income workers have also gone up, with the real income of locals at the 20th percentile rising 2.7 per cent per annum over the same period, he said.
On jobs in the ICT sector, Dr Tan said that the industry is a fast-growing one facing talent shortages worldwide. In 2021, one-fifth of EP holders here worked in the ICT sector, an increase from one-sixth in 2016.
""The growth of the Information & Communications sector has also resulted in the creation of more jobs for our locals - in the same timeframe, we saw strong growth in the number of local PMETs by 34,400,"" said Dr Tan.
""Median local wages in the sector also continue to increase. Therefore, we can see quite clearly that this is not a zero-sum game.""
In his answer to Mr Gerald Giam's (WP - Aljunied) question on whether MOM can consider imposing a quota for the ""bottom half of income earners"" among EP holders, Dr Tan said that at the EP level, the focus is on ensuring that the workers are ""of good quality"".
The authorities do not impose quotas, as this will restrict Singapore's ability to compete and hold back companies here. Dr Tan said that MOM has made significant adjustments to the EP framework to emphasise quality.
Some changes include benchmarking the EP qualifying salary to the top one-third of the local PMET workforce, and introducing a points-based Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) from Sep 1 next year.
""Companies whose candidates cannot meet the EP qualifying salary or pass COMPASS will have to apply for an S Pass instead, where they will be subject to a quota. This is a neater solution than what Mr Giam is suggesting,"" said Dr Tan.
""Compared to his suggestion where some EP holders are subjected to a quota while others are not, our current approach has the merit of keeping the positioning and the criteria of each pass type clear, and overall work pass framework simpler for businesses.""

Dr Tan also addressed questions from Ms Tan and Ms Mariam Jaafar (PAP - Sembawang) on bringing back overseas Singaporean talent, and developing local talent. 
""Local talent development already happens organically in tandem with economic growth,"" Dr Tan said.
""As businesses expand their investments here, they will need to find manpower to fill various roles and invest in training and upgrading their workers.
""By working in leading firms and alongside global talent, our local workers will also gain exposure to new ideas and best practices from around the world.""
The Government and tripartite partners help to ""catalyse this process"" with its programmes, Dr Tan said, highlighting that there are transformation plans across 23 sectors through the Industry Transformation Maps.
""We have also put in place a whole ecosystem of programmes and schemes which businesses can tap on to prepare their workers for jobs of the future,"" he said.
Dr Tan said that strengthening Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent which is ""brimming with exciting opportunities"" will help to bring back overseas Singaporeans who are keen to contribute and be a part of this ecosystem.
He said that the Government actively engages overseas Singaporeans, so that they can make an informed decision about whether and when to return to Singapore, citing the Singapore Global Network as an example.

MPs also asked about the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), which sets out requirements for all employers to consider local workers fairly for job opportunities. 
Dr Tan said that from 2017 to 2021, MOM took enforcement action against about 300 companies, including issuing warnings, and being barred from hiring or renewing foreign workers.
In addition, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) has engaged with more than 1,700 employers under the FCF.
These are firms on an FCF Watchlist that have an exceptionally high share of foreign PMETs compared to their industry peers, or a high concentration of a single foreign nationality source.  But firms on the watchlist have not flouted any rules, Dr Tan reiterated.
Dr Tan said that while the number of cases of discriminatory practices is small, MOM will remain vigilant. 
Besides investigating complaints lodged with TAFEP, the ministry uses data analytics to identify suspicious cases for further investigation. 
""There is no place for discrimination in Singapore. The Ministry of Manpower does not and will not tolerate unfair hiring practices, and employers who do not give locals a fair chance will face stiff penalties,"" he said.
""The Fair Consideration Framework or FCF sets out requirements for all employers to consider local workers fairly for job opportunities and work is now under way to enshrine this in legislation.""

Speaking in Parliament on the progress of air travel recovery, he noted that these aviation stakeholders have already been building up the workforce and training new hires since early this year. 
And the first half of 2022 saw the air transport sector recover to about 80 per cent of pre-COVID levels, he said. 
Addressing queries on whether recruitment could be sped up, Mr Iswaran highlighted that this is “a very challenging time” for aviation companies. 
“I think we know that there’s just a general shortage of manpower. And in particular, for aviation, especially on the air side, it’s not just about recruitment, but we got to make sure that they are trained, and they are able to deliver safely for themselves and for all other uses of the aviation services,” he said. 
Mr Iswaran added that digitalisation and sustainability are key considerations for the industry and in hiring new talent. 
“And for this, we will need specific skill sets. So we either have to retrain those who are already in the industry, and that is happening as we speak, but at the same time, we also may need specific types of talent to come onboard to augment what we already have,” he said. 
“And so this is something that both the airlines but also the airport and ground handlers are focused on.”

Arrivals in Terminal 2 had also commenced on May 29. 
With these, Changi Airport will have the physical capacity to accommodate “up to 70 million passengers per annum, which is about 100 per cent the capacity that we had or the passenger traffic levels that we had pre-COVID”, added Mr Iswaran.

Since Singapore reopened its borders to all fully-vaccinated travellers without testing or quarantine in April this year, air travel has “recovered steadily”, Mr Iswaran said. 
“As of the first week of September, average weekly passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered to above 60 per cent of pre-COVID-19 levels. And it has held at that level steadily,” he said. 
“The number of flights at Changi Airport has also recovered to nearly two-thirds of pre-COVID-19 levels.”
The minister added that the number of flights that airlines have filed to operate at Changi Airport by the year end is more than 80 per cent of pre-COVID levels. 
This is expected to increase further as airlines respond to travel demand following the recent border easing announcements by key travel markets, such as Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan."
"More than 2,000 people exempted from vaccination-differentiated measures due to adverse reactions to COVID-19 shots: MOH","The observed rate of COVID-19 deaths was around 2 in 1,000 for this group, compared to 0.3 in 1,000 in the whole population.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2000-exempted-vaccine-differentiated-covid-19-adverse-vaccines-2982301,"SINGAPORE: More than 2,000 people have been exempted from COVID-19 vaccination-differentiated restrictions due to adverse reactions to vaccines, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday (Oct 3) in Parliament.
In response to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) on excess deaths due to COVID-19 among those medically ineligible to be fully vaccinated, he said MOH does not comprehensively track these numbers.
But he revealed that as at Jun 30, 2,100 people had successfully applied for exemption from vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS).
For this group, the observed rate of deaths was around two in 1,000, compared to 0.3 in 1,000 for the whole population.
“In reality, the number of people who are ineligible for COVID-19 vaccines is small, given the vaccine options available,” said Mr Ong.
Last month, the Health Ministry released a report showing that Singapore had recorded an estimated 2,490 excess deaths during the pandemic from January 2020 to June 2022.
This refers to the difference between actual deaths from all causes since the pandemic began, and expected deaths if there had not been COVID-19.
The report stated that nearly three in five excess deaths in Singapore during the pandemic were directly caused by the coronavirus, and the remainder were patients who had died of other illnesses within 90 days of being infected.
“Our death rate essentially went back to 2018 levels, wiping out improvements over a few years,” said Mr Ong.
He noted that compared to other countries that have opened up, Singapore’s number of excess deaths is much lower, based on estimates for 2020 and 2021 by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
WHO figures put Singapore's excess deaths at 26 per 100,000 persons per year.

Mr Ong reiterated the importance of getting booster shots to be properly protected against COVID-19, adding that vaccinations are key to reducing excess deaths.
“We need to get a booster, in other words, three doses of mRNA vaccines. It will reduce the risk of severe illnesses and deaths significantly. Two shots do not do the job completely,” he stressed.
He added that the reimposition of safe management measures cannot be ruled out in the event of a surge in infections and severe illnesses, as it would help preserve healthcare capacity and ensure sufficient resources.
“But we will do so only when it is necessary to save lives,” he said.
“The pandemic is not entirely over, but we hope we are at the endgame, and will continue to navigate through the crisis with resilience and unity.”

"Online platforms, social media firms may be ordered to block access to harmful content under new Bill","As part of the proposed measures, social media services will also need to put in place system-wide measures to limit Singapore users' exposure to harmful content.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/harmful-online-content-protect-children-internet-sexual-violence-self-harm-2982196,"SINGAPORE: Social media platforms may soon have to comply with a code of practice to tackle harmful online content accessible in Singapore, after the introduction of a Bill in Parliament on Monday (Oct 3).
If enacted, the Bill will empower the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to designate online communication services that have ""significant reach or impact"", and require them to mitigate the risks of being exposed to harmful content.
The Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill will also empower IMDA to issue directions to deal with ""egregious content"", according to a media factsheet from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).
Egregious content includes content advocating suicide or self-harm, physical or sexual violence and terrorism, content depicting child sexual exploitation, content posing a public health risk in Singapore, and content likely to cause racial and religious disharmony in Singapore.
In March, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo announced that the Government was looking at introducing measures to ensure a safer online environment, including for children. MCI launched a public consultation on its proposals in July.
On Monday, MCI said that while some online services have made efforts to address harmful content, the prevalence of such content remained a concern given the ""high level of digital penetration and pervasive usage of online services"" in Singapore, including among children.
A January survey by the Sunlight Alliance for Action to tackle online harms found that almost half of the respondents had personally encountered harmful online content, the ministry said.
MCI also cited another survey it conducted in June, which found that almost all respondents felt harmful online content could have at least a moderate impact on children and youths.
Those survey respondents identified sexual content, cyberbullying and violent content as the top three types of content from which the young needed to be protected.

CODE OF PRACTICE
The proposed Bill will introduce a new part to the Broadcasting Act to regulate online communication services accessible in Singapore, which can be provided from within or outside the country.
MCI said that its regulatory approach consisted of two key parts: Requiring the regulated online communication services to comply with a code of practice, and dealing with egregious content.
The proposed code of practice covers the systems or processes that regulated service providers need to establish and apply to prevent people in Singapore, especially children, from accessing content that presents ""a material risk of significant harm"".
The regulated service providers would also be expected to ""mitigate and manage the risks of danger"" from content on their services.
To that end, the code could provide practical guidance on what content presents a material risk of significant harm to users of these online communication services.
The code of practice could also lay out the procedures that regulated service providers must follow. These include audits, reporting to IMDA on the measures they have implemented, and conducting risk assessments.
The code could also require regulated service providers to collaborate with research studies conducted by experts approved by IMDA, aimed at improving understanding of the systemic risks in the service providers.
SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES
Social media services are one type of online communication services that will be specified in a new schedule under the Broadcasting Act.
Under IMDA's draft code of practice for online safety, social media services will be expected to put in place system-wide measures to minimise users' exposure to harmful content and give them tools to manage their own safety.
Categories of harmful content include sexual content, violent content, suicide and self-harm content, cyberbullying content, content endangering public health and content facilitating vice and organised crime.
""In particular, social media services must take additional steps to minimise children's exposure to inappropriate content and provide tools that allow children or their parents to manage their safety on these services,"" said the ministry.
They must minimise exposure through measures such as having a set of community guidelines and standards, and content moderation.
""Users should be empowered to manage their own safety on the services by having access to tools such as those that may hide harmful content or reduce the visibility of their own profile to other users,"" said MCI.
They should also have access to safety information, including Singapore-based safety resources.
Other key outcomes include an ""easy-to-use mechanism"" for users to report harmful content and unwanted interactions, and transparency about how well the services are protecting users in Singapore, said MCI.
Failure to comply with an applicable code of practice may result in IMDA ordering a financial penalty or a direction to take steps to remedy the failure.
Non-compliance with the direction to remedy the failure could be an offence, punishable with a fine upon conviction.
MEASURES AGAINST EGREGIOUS CONTENT
The proposed Bill will also allow IMDA to deal with egregious content by issuing three types of directions:
A direction issued to an online communication service provider to disable access by users in Singapore to the content on its service
A direction issued to an online communication service provider to ensure that a specified account (such as a social media account, group or channel) that is communicating the egregious content cannot continue communicating to users in Singapore
A direction issued to the Internet access service provider to block access by users in Singapore to the non-compliant online communication service
Under the proposed Bill, the IMDA cannot issue these directions in respect of private communications. Failure to comply with the directions could be an offence, punishable with a fine on conviction.
Appeals against the directions can be made to the Minister for Communications and Information.
""In light of the fast-evolving nature of harmful online content, the Bill and the proposed code of practice for online safety are important steps towards creating a safer online space for Singapore users, particularly children,"" said MCI.
 
Parliament will debate the Bill at its second reading, slated for November.

130 people have received incorrect doses of COVID-19 vaccines: MOH,"They were a mix of adults and children who either had no adverse reactions or recovered uneventfully.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccine-overdose-underdose-130-moh-undiluted-incorrect-2982176,"SINGAPORE: There have been 130 cases of people in Singapore receiving incorrect doses of COVID-19 vaccines, according to figures released by the Ministry of Health on Monday (Oct 3).
Speaking in Parliament, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said that as of Sep 26, 11 people have been affected by overdosing while 119 people were affected by underdosing of the vaccinations.
This is out of approximately 16 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered since the start of the pandemic. 
Of the 130, seven were children aged between five and 11, who did not have any adverse reactions.
The rest, adults, either had no adverse reactions or recovered uneventfully, said Dr Puthucheary.
His response came after an incident last month where two adults were each given a full vial of undiluted Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic in Hougang.
One was hospitalised after experiencing headache and increased heart rate and has since been discharged. The other patient did not report any adverse reaction.
The clinic, which comes under ProHealth Medical Group, and the doctor who administered the vaccine have been suspended from the National Vaccination Programme until further notice.
Last year, among other cases, a 103-year-old woman was erroneously given a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 111 patients and six staff at Bukit Merah Polyclinic were given lower doses of the vaccine.

Responding to questions from Members of Parliament about safeguards to prevent overdosing or underdosing of COVID-19 vaccines, Dr Puthucheary said all providers under the National Vaccination Programme are licensed and regulated by the MOH.
Additional regulations stipulating eligibility criteria, dilution and administration of the recommended dosage for each vaccine have been issued specifically for COVID-19 vaccination.
“Vaccination providers are expected to assess their staff competencies in COVID-19 vaccination administration,” he added.
Dr Puthucheary said that in the event of any vaccine administration errors and medical emergencies following vaccination, vaccination providers are required to report to MOH no later than three hours after the incident.
Providers also need to inform patients immediately when a vaccination error has occurred, and monitor their health with daily calls for the next seven days to ensure their well-being.
In the event of an error, MOH will investigate and if there are any systemic issues, it will work with providers to review and improve their work processes, Dr Puthucheary added. 
He said MOH was currently investigating ProHealth Medical Group about the incident and will take appropriate enforcement actions if there are any regulatory breaches.
""The vast majority of the clinics and vaccine providers do a great job of ensuring that the patients are cared for safely, the vaccines are provided safely with the correct dosage,"" said Dr Puthucheary.
""We have to identify, first of all, whether this is an issue with individual member personnel, whether it's something about the processes at the site or whether it is something systemic about the overall vaccination process.
""All our data, so far, suggests that the last is not likely, and the vast majority of our doses have been delivered quite safely. Nevertheless MOH continues to review all of this."""
Coroner records open verdict in case of 34-year-old woman found dead in condominium,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coroner-open-verdict-case-34-year-old-woman-found-dead-condominium-alcohol-sleeping-pills-marisa-zhang-yan-ni-2982121,"SINGAPORE: A coroner has ruled an open verdict in the death of a 34-year-old woman who was found dead in a condominium apartment after neighbours reported a foul smell.
Ms Marisa Zhang Yan Ni, a marketing executive with ERA Singapore, lived alone at L'viv Condominium in Newton Road, according to a set of findings made available on Monday (Oct 3).
The condo manager called the police on Apr 5 this year, saying that they were unable to get hold of Ms Zhang since the previous Saturday, and that residents had given feedback about a foul smell coming from the unit.
A friend of Ms Zhang's, named only as Mr Soh, had also gone to the unit to look for her as he had been unable to contact her for several days.
The apartment was locked when the police went down that same morning, and a locksmith was engaged to dismantle the lock.
When the police officer entered the sole bedroom in the apartment, he found the decomposed body of a woman in a nightgown, lying at an angle with her feet on the bed, her lower torso slumped down against the bed and her head resting on the floor.
She was pronounced dead that same morning, but investigations found that she had died about a week ago.
Police investigations showed no signs of ransacking or any marks on the door or lock that indicated tampering. There was an unopened blue parcel outside the main door, a brownish stain on the living room curtain, a small blood stain on the wall outside the bedroom and brownish stains under the toilet bowl. The stain on the curtain and toilet bowl contained Ms Zhang's blood and DNA.
Various types of medication prescribed to Ms Zhang were found outside the bedroom, while her fridge contained cans of beer and bottles of alcohol were found on the living room table.
The body was identified to be Ms Zhang's through fingerprint identification, but an autopsy could not ascertain the cause of death due to advanced decomposition.
TOXICOLOGY ANALYSIS
Samples of Ms Zhang's liver and kidney were obtained for toxicology analysis and showed the presence of ethanol, quetiapine and trazodone. Quetiapine is an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, while trazadone is used for depression.
The level of alcohol in Ms Zhang's organ tissues was rather high, indicating a possibility that she had consumed alcohol. However, it was not possible to correlate the level of alcohol found in the decomposing tissue samples with consumption.
It was also not possible to determine if the levels of quetiapine and trazadone in Ms Zhang's body were consistent with therapeutic levels or indicated an overdose.
Ms Zhang's medical records showed that she had a history of insomnia and was on follow-up with a psychiatrist. She was noted to consume excessive amounts of alcohol at home and was seen in the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital in July 2020 for alcohol intoxication.
She was treated at a clinic for her irregular menstruation cycle in August 2020 and was noted then to have a history of alcohol abuse and sleeping pill addiction.
She was admitted to hospital in December 2021 for a deep laceration over her foot caused by a broken shard of glass. She was discharged after several days, declining antibiotics following advice that it should not be mixed with alcohol.
SHE REGULARLY TOOK ALCOHOL WITH SLEEPING PILLS
Mr Soh, who had gone to her apartment to look for Ms Zhang, testified that Ms Zhang would consume sleeping pills and alcohol daily to help with her insomnia. She mentioned being treated for depression and had a proclivity for skipping meals as she wanted to be skinny, he said.
He said she tended to get injured due to her unsteady gait after taking sleeping pills, and attributed the bloodstain on the living room curtain to the incident in December 2021 where she cut her foot.
Another close friend of Ms Zhang recounted a history of Ms Zhang consuming sleeping pills and drinking a lot of alcohol to address her insomnia. In the months before her death, the friend said Ms Zhang was increasingly confused about what she was doing and would fall asleep at random places.
The chief agency officer at ERA Singapore, Ms Zhang's supervisor since 2012, testified that Ms Zhang regularly consumed sleeping pills prescribed to her by a psychiatrist she had been consulting since 2016.
She was observed to drink a lot of alcohol and would usually consume her sleeping pills with wine, said the officer. He said Ms Zhang was clumsy and would often fall after consuming a lot of alcohol, with her palms and knees covered in bruises or abrasions.
Condominium entry records showed that Ms Zhang had no visitors in the two weeks preceding her death other than Mr Soh. There were a total of five food deliveries for Ms Zhang between Mar 22 and Mar 27 this year.
Ms Zhang's sister, who lives in Beijing, said she last spoke to her sister in a video call on Mar 28. They spoke about the wedding of Ms Zhang's sister. Ms Zhang was last seen online on WeChat at 1.25am on Mar 29, 2022.
She said Ms Zhang had been in a relationship, but it had ended as the man was married. According to Ms Zhang's sister, Ms Zhang appeared to have ""coped well"" with the break-up. Ms Zhang's sister knew that Ms Zhang consumed a lot of alcohol and suffered from insomnia.
The coroner said Ms Zhang was not known to have expressed any suicidal or self-harm tendencies.
""The circumstances suggest that Ms Zhang demised sometime after 1.25am on Mar 29 and prior to the foul smell that was reported to have permeated the (floor on which the apartment was situated) on the night of Apr 4,"" she said.
She returned an open verdict as pathologists are unable to ascertain the cause of death, and conveyed condolences to Ms Zhang's family for their loss."
Nurse testifies that man offered her S$50 to record him as vaccinated without taking his jab,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nurse-testifies-man-offered-her-s50-record-him-vaccinated-without-taking-his-jab-2981976,"SINGAPORE: A man went on trial on Monday (Oct 3) over a charge of offering a S$50 bribe in exchange for his medical records to reflect that he had received his second COVID-19 vaccination jab.
Kelvin Tan Li Ming, 35, contested the single charge of corruption which allegedly occurred at the Healthway Vaccination Centre @ Choa Chu Kang Community Club on Oct 26, 2021.
The prosecution's first witness was Ms Eunice Lee En Hui, the part-time vaccination nurse who was allegedly the target of Tan's proposed bribe.
Ms Lee told the court that she was employed by Homage Home Care at the time, providing Pfizer jabs. She said that when she first met Tan at the booth in the vaccination hall, she verified his name and identification card number.
She also checked his records in the medical system and saw that he had already received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
While she was verifying Tan's details, Ms Lee said he asked her if it was OK for him to give her S$50 in return for recording in the system that he had received a jab, when in fact he had not.
Ms Lee said she told Tan ""no"", and asked him why he did not want to be vaccinated, since he had already received his first dose.
""He mentioned he doesn't believe in the whole COVID-19 situation,"" she said, and that according to Tan, Singapore brought in the Pfizer shot ""for stocks, for Singapore's economy"".
She then testified that Tan said that he was getting vaccinated because his new job required him to be and he also asked what would happen if he offered her more money.
Ms Lee said she then told Tan that she could not do this, as it was ""something to do (with) my integrity and my licence"".
She said that Tan replied that ""integrity is not important"", and said that he had found work after being jobless for a long time.
""So I told him that integrity is very important, maybe that's the reason why he has been jobless for so long,"" said Ms Lee.
Tan, who was on remand and defended himself, asked the judge at this point if he could object now or later. He was given various tips by both the judge and prosecutor on how to make arguments and cross-examine the witness.
Ms Lee said she was in shock as it was the first time she was in such a situation. She kept the vaccine vial, fearing Tan might use it as a weapon, and reported the incident to her manager. She said she wanted to ensure that Tan had not bribed the first nurse who gave him his first dose, and to prevent future incidents if he were to return. 
When she saw Tan sitting in the observation area despite not taking a jab, she asked him to leave the hall.
A police report was later filed against Tan.
ACCUSED CROSS-EXAMINES WITNESS
In cross-examination, Tan objected to several things Ms Lee had said. He first claimed he never said exactly that he would give her S$50 for her to edit the system.
""I did not say that I would give you S$50 in exchange for you to write or record or edit in the system,"" said Tan.
""I did ask two questions. If I can remember vaguely - (the first one was) can you edit the system, then we talked for a while. After that, I asked you a second time - is S$50 enough. These two questions are not in succession and are different, not joined together.""
He asserted that he did not offer Ms Lee any money, but Ms Lee stood by her claim that he did.
Tan then questioned Ms Lee about her years of experience and if she had encountered any difficult patients in that time.
""If a patient approached you and said I'm having things, I don't know what's happening to me, how would you answer?"" asked Tan.
""I will ask them to see a doctor or I will inform the doctor,"" replied Ms Lee.
""Can you tell your experience about one bad patient encounter? How did you resolve the problem?"" asked Tan.
""It's confidential,"" replied Ms Lee, and Tan responded: ""OK no problem.""
When Tan asked Ms Lee if she had ever made a mistake in her 10 years of work experience as a nurse, Ms Lee said she had not.
""So you are perfectness ah,"" said Tan.
""No one is perfect, I'm just being professional,"" answered Ms Lee.
The court also heard that the investigation officer on the case who took Tan's statement had tested positive for COVID-19 and might have his testimony postponed or changed to a testimony by video recording.
The trial continues. If convicted of offering a bribe, Tan can be jailed up to five years, fined up to S$100,000, or both."
"Prices of HDB resale flats, private homes rise at slower pace in third quarter: Flash estimates",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-resale-flats-private-property-rise-slower-pace-2981871,"SINGAPORE: Prices for HDB resale flats and private residential properties rose at a slower pace in the third quarter of this year, according to flash estimates released by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Monday (Oct 3). 
Resale HDB prices rose 2.4 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 2.8 per cent in the second quarter. 
The resale price index, which provides information on general price movements in the resale public housing market, rose from 163.9 to 167.8, estimates showed.
Analysts said the slower price growth indicates that the housing sector has started to feel the effects of rising interest rates and inflation. 
""Price resistance may have set in as the Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) seems to have declined in recent months,"" said OrangeTee & Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics Christine Sun.
COV refers to the difference between the transacted price and the unit’s official valuation by the HDB, which buyers must pay fully in cash.
HDB resale prices are also expected to moderate in the fourth quarter in the wake of newly announced cooling measures. 
""Private property owners will now need to sell off their private property and wait 15 months before they can buy a HDB resale flat,"" said Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons' Asia.
""This effectively cuts off the demand from private property owners and ex-private property owners. But this is a temporary measure. It may be reinstated back to the old policy once prices stabilise and the attention-grabbing million-dollar flat situation has cooled ... Some demand may flow to the 4-room flats and push up prices,"" he added.
Mr Lee also expected prices to moderate further to 1.0 per cent to 2.0 per cent in the fourth quarter, giving rise to a full-year price gain of not more than 10 per cent. 
Meanwhile, Ms Sun said the 15-month wait-out period for private homeowners purchasing HDB flats will impact the upper tier of the market adversely.
""Since some private homeowners will face bigger hurdles in purchasing resale flats, there will likely be a temporary pull-back in demand for large flats which may result in a price correction in the coming months.""
She also added that new measures like the tightening of borrowing limits for both HDB loans and private loans, as well as a more stringent total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) and the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR), will be affecting almost all flat buyers, including BTO flat purchases.

Meanwhile, private home prices rose 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 3.5 per cent in the previous quarter. 
Prices in the Outside Central Region (OCR) rose the most - by 7 per cent compared with the 2.1 per cent increase in the previous quarter, URA data showed. 
Analysts attributed the steep increase to rising median prices of new non-landed homes.
""There were 3 major launches in 3Q 2022 - AMO Residence, Lentor Modern and Sky Eden@Bedok which are all in the OCR,"" said Mr Lee. 
""AMO Residence was a near sell-out in July, achieving an average price of S$2,113 per square foot. Sky Eden@Bedok sold 75 per cent at an average of S$2,100 per square foot on launch day. These two projects probably played a part in the steep rise in OCR prices.""
Ms Sun added that the higher median prices together with a high volume of such transactions led to a significant increase in the overall index for OCR. 
The median prices of new non-landed homes last quarter rose by 18 per cent from S$1,774 per square foot in Q2 2022 to a record S$2,093 per square foot in Q3 2022, she pointed out. 
""Last quarter also saw more non-landed new sales in OCR, which jumped from 471 units in Q2 2022 to 1,238 units in Q3 2022. Therefore, the higher median prices coupled with a high volume of such transactions led to a significant increase in the overall index for OCR.""
Prices in the Core Central Region (CCR) rose by 2.3 per cent up from the 1.9 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, those in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) rose at a slower pace of 2.5 per cent compared with the 6.4 per cent in the previous quarter. 
The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment, and data on units sold by developers up till mid-September.
URA will release its full set of updated real estate statistics for the third quarter of 2022 later this month. 
In an update on upcoming sales launches, HDB said it will offer in November about 9,500 BTO flats in areas such as Bukit Batok, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Tengah and Yishun.
In February 2023, about 2,900 to 3,900 BTO flats in areas such as Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown and Tengah will be made available. 
""This number is subject to review as more project details will be firmed up closer to the launch date,"" it added. 
There is a good mix of (flats) across mature and non-matures estates and (it) may draw demand from the resale market, said Mr Lee. 
He added that some of the flats are on sites that could come under the Prime Location Public Housing model - one in Kallang Whampoa, one along Queensway and one at Ghim Moh. 
HDB also said it will launch up to 23,000 new flats in 2023 and is prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025 if needed. 
""HDB will continue to monitor the housing demand and adjust the plans where necessary.""

The Big Read: Is society becoming less informed as social media platforms shun hard news?,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/news-social-media-tiktok-informed-societies-2979261,"SINGAPORE: For the past decade, Ms Diana Lou has been relying on Facebook for her daily dose of news. 
But since the end of last year, the 58-year-old part-time early childhood educator has increasingly found herself having to go directly to the home page of the media outlets that she follows in order to stay abreast of what is happening around the world, instead of simply scrolling through her news feed. 
This is because her feed has become increasingly populated by advertisements.
“The (Facebook) news feed is sickening. Now there are more and more advertisements. So I make it such that I purposefully go into the page that I’ve followed (to read the news),” said Ms Lou. 
Another user, 32-year-old Joanne Loh, has also noticed the change in her Facebook feed.
While the civil servant said that Facebook continues to be her main source of news, she is nevertheless “mildly frustrated” that the news content that appears on her feed is no longer in chronological order.
“It means that sometimes I’m reading news that’s three days old, and I’m thinking ‘oh, I missed this’,” said Ms Loh, adding that she has observed this occurring more frequently in the last two years or so. 
Their experiences reflect the evolving changes that the social media giant has been making to its algorithm, which determines what - and in which order - users see their posts.
Since Mr Mark Zuckerberg and his then dormitory roommates created Facebook in 2004 as a way to connect students at Harvard University, it has greatly disrupted the way news is disseminated and consumed on the world wide web. 
A report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 - more than a decade after Facebook was created - found that more than half of Internet users turned to social media news each week, with Facebook being the top social media news source among those surveyed.
However, over the years, Facebook has tweaked its algorithm from one which prioritises content - including news - based on chronology to one which pushes more targeted ads to users on their feeds, or posts with higher engagement.
Other social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, have similarly made changes to how their algorithms work, consequently shaping what and how newsrooms produce their news.
But the biggest change is set to come as the newest kid on the block, TikTok, turns the industry on its head with features that have propelled the short-video platform into superstardom, especially among the young. 
The meteoric rise of TikTok, which was launched only six years ago, has been well-documented. 
Unlike Facebook and other social media apps before it, TikTok, developed by Chinese tech company ByteDance, recommends content based on users’ interests, rather than which accounts they follow.
This has left Facebook scrambling to catch up, with the latest tweaks to its algorithm, announced in July, mimicking that of TikTok’s. In what has been dubbed as the ""TikTokification"" of social media, other platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have also tweaked their offerings to try and beat TikTok at its own game. 
Industry observers have said that the move to de-emphasise content based on posts from people within users' social circles - and instead letting algorithms dictate which postings should appear on users' feeds based on the machine’s “reading” of their preferences - heralds the end of social media as the world knows it. 
“Social media was initially a place where you went to see what was going on with people you knew - friends and family, and later on, people you were interested in following, "" said Mr Alan Soon, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Splice Media, which helps to build media start-ups in Asia.
“The assumption was always that you'd be interested in those closest to you, and the algorithms were optimised to deliver that to you.”
But TikTok has “shaken up” that assumption.
“TikTok’s algorithm has shown that people can and will engage with content that's unrelated to them - but yet buzzy enough,” said Mr Soon, who was also a journalist for 20 years.

Commentary: Concerns over TikTok feeding user data to Beijing are back, with good reason













These changes have also led to the rise of social media users “who don’t seek out the news” and consume whatever the algorithm delivers to them in a social media feed, he added. 
One such user is Ms Qistina Farisha Safrani Mohamed Faizal, a third-year student from Singapore Polytechnic, who does not keep up with the news every day.
The 19-year-old, who rarely uses Facebook and does not get much news on her TikTok or Instagram accounts, said that she does not feel the need to keep up with the news daily even though she believes in the importance of keeping abreast of important developments.
“As long as you log in to your news app, or know what is happening at least once a week, then I think it is fine because probably people will tell you about stuff (news) and you will check it out,” she said.
Even as they make the latest changes to their algorithms, social media platforms have also signalled that news will become even less of a priority for them.
In Singapore, Facebook officials have recently told newsrooms that it is refocusing its algorithm to distribute content related to entertainment, lifestyle, sports and viral stories - over news and political stories - to users’ feeds.
Given these changes, several media-watchers interviewed by TODAY expressed concern over the possibility of echo chambers being reinforced online, even as newsrooms try to fit “bells and whistles” to their news content to capture the attention of users, or reduce their reliance on social media to disseminate news.
And with end-users no longer seeking out the news on their own accord, a less-informed citizenry will emerge in the future - much to the detriment of the proper functioning of society, as one of them put it.





      From Friendster to Facebook to TikTok: Social media's evolution
  

The concept of social media - where people connect with others by “adding” them as a friend - arguably dates back to the era of Friendster and MySpace, both precursors of Facebook.
Friendster, which allowed users to build a profile and connect with friends, amassed 3 million users within a few months of its debut in 2002.  
A year later came MySpace, which allowed users to customise their publicly visible profile pages. By 2005, it had 25 million users and was sold to Rupert Murdoch’s media company News Corp.
However, both MySpace and Friendster were bogged down by technical difficulties and an inability to keep up with user preferences. 
While Friendster was eventually shut down in 2015, MySpace has rebranded itself as a social networking site for users to discover and share music. It is now jointly owned by American media companies TI Gotham and Time.
In 2004, second-year Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg was developing a site called “FaceMash”, which was designed to rate the attractiveness of women on campus.
But the “prank website”, as described by Mr Zuckerberg during a hearing by the United States Congress in 2018, quickly gave way to “The Facebook”.
The platform allowed Harvard students, and later anyone with a verified email address, to build up their personal profiles, update their relationship status and “add” each other as friends.
Within four years, it had become the go-to site for “social interaction” in cyberspace - amassing 100 million users, and then expanded to 1 billion in the next four.  
Currently, Facebook, as it is now known, has close to 3 billion active users every month.
Apart from remaking the way people communicate and connect, Facebook has also changed the way news is produced, disseminated and consumed.  
“Facebook’s role has evolved from a network for friends to share personal information to a way for people to share, recommend and link together all kinds of information, including news,” said the authors of a 2011 report by the Washington DC-based Pew Research Centre on the importance of Facebook.  
“If searching for news was the most important development of the last decade, sharing news may be among the most important of the next,” they added.
Since then, other social media platforms have served as outlets for news as well, including YouTube, Instagram (which has been acquired by Facebook’s parent company Meta) and Twitter.
All the major platforms have tweaked their algorithms and functions over the years, driving media companies to change their products to bring more traffic to their own media sites. 
In the case of Facebook, one of its earliest changes was in 2009, when it stopped showing users posts in chronological order to bump up posts with more likes and comments.
The move drove users, including publishers and media companies, to design “clickbait” posts with catchy headlines to boost interaction.
Around 2015, Facebook made videos a priority in its algorithm to encourage people to spend more time on its platform. That year, Facebook overtook Google as the top driver of traffic to news sites. 
But the platform became a hotbed of misinformation in the heat of the 2016 United States’ presidential election campaign between Mr Donald Trump and Mrs Hillary Clinton.
The situation worsened after another tweak to its algorithm in 2018, which showed users more posts from friends and families over those from big publishers; inevitably sending divisive posts on the bitter contest to the top of people’s feeds.
Since then, Facebook has been de-emphasising news content on its feed. 
In late July this year, Facebook tweaked its algorithm so that people scrolling through its home page can discover content that is “uniquely personalised to them” instead of emphasising content from friends and family, said Meta, its parent company, in a blog post. 
Similar changes have also been made to Instagram.
Facebook has indicated that hard news will continue to be less of a priority on its feed, with its algorithm refocused to distribute entertainment, lifestyle and sports content, as well as viral stories. It will stop feeding news and political stories to users’ feeds. Neither will it boost videos that are produced on its rival TikTok’s platform.
Meanwhile, TikTok, which is rapidly gaining dominance in the social media scene, has signalled that news content will not be a priority on its platform.
Known for short-form videos, TikTok has billed itself as a platform to ""inspire creativity and bring joy"". 
It has also imposed strict guidelines for news content, such as including trigger warnings for “sensitive content” and requiring newsrooms to condemn illegal behaviour in posts depicting criminal activity in a bid to keep viewers safe from risky content.

HOW SOCIAL MEDIA HAS UPENDED THE NEWS INDUSTRY
Despite multiple changes to their algorithms, social media platforms, ultimately, are geared towards “having as many users as possible, having users spend as long as an amount of time as possible, and having users engage with the platform in as many ways as possible”, said Professor Lim Sun Sun of the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).
To this end, Prof Lim, whose research interest includes technology and society, said that social media platforms curate news based on their user demographic. 
For instance, older platforms that are trying to make themselves more competitive and relevant are proactively pushing content which includes videos and infographics as preferred by younger users, rather than simply hyperlinks to news reports as preferred by older users.
This creates a ""virtuous circle"" where newsrooms respond accordingly to the type of content favoured by social media platforms, which is also driven by the type of content preferred by consumers, said Prof Lim, who is also the Head of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at SUTD.
Veteran journalist and media trainer Bertha Henson said that it has become “even harder and harder” for the mainstream media to get the attention of people due to the proliferation of social media platforms and news mediums. 
As a result, the news media needs to add “bells and whistles”, such as videos and interactive graphics, to capture readers’ attention with their news, although this is usually at the expense of the quality of the content itself, she added.
Likewise, Mr Soon of Splice Media said that people generally “stumble on the news”, which is delivered by algorithms that determine their usefulness based on engagement.
As a result, social media platforms are “juiced to show you what outrages people, what excites people, what gets them worked up”. This is often at odds with journalism, which favours fairness and objectivity, said Mr Soon.
“The platforms have taught publishers and influencers that the best way to get engagement is through outrage,” he said.
While this is sometimes helpful, such as getting people interested in issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States or the Russia-Ukraine war, it often saps the energy of consumers who are in a stage of constant outrage.
This could lead users to have mental health issues related to higher anxiety, or the fear of missing out. They could also outrightly reject news as something that drives pessimism and helplessness, said Mr Soon.

Dr Wu Shangyuan, a lecturer and media researcher from the Department of Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore (NUS), also warned of the creation of “filter bubbles”, where users become exposed to a much narrower range of topics and perspectives.
This is because algorithms will feed content to users based on those that people in their networks share - and these may not necessarily be their friends - or that the algorithms have deduced people are interested in.
“Essentially, users will tend to be fed with news that interests their social networks or aligns with their existing interests and preferences,” said Dr Wu.
Dr Carol Soon, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), said that although the dangers of echo chambers and hijacking by disinformation producers are “very real”, research that she had conducted showed that people here have a higher trust in traditional media, even though social media is a popular source of news.
For example, her study released in 2020 found that among the various media outlets, the most trusted sources of news were television, print newspaper, radio and websites of mass media outlets.

BAD NEWS FOR NEWSROOMS - BUT IS THERE A SILVER LINING?
With the move to further reduce the priority of news content in social media, there are longer-term ramifications for both the news industry and consumers, said those interviewed.
Some of them warned that the changes to the social media landscape could herald a poorer quality of news.
Ms Henson noted that social media users are not ready to read beyond the news headlines and want to be informed immediately about what is happening.
As such, newsrooms are focused on catching consumers’ attention, at the expense of doing their basic job of journalism which is to get, attribute and verify information before it is published or broadcast.
“Whenever (news organisations) say things like we must digitalise, or learn to engage readers, it seems like our focus is on trying to get the eyeballs, rather than give the eyeballs something to read,” said Ms Henson.
However, she said that one possible silver lining to social media algorithms reducing their emphasis on news is that newsrooms could be spurred to find ways to draw audiences to their websites directly by offering better quality content, rather than rely on social media platforms for referral traffic. 
In the case of news consumers, the observers highlighted the risk of society becoming less informed if they continue to rely on social media for their news.
Dr Wu of NUS said that if algorithm changes reducing the emphasis on news are not communicated properly to audiences, there is the risk of them just relying on social media for their daily news intake, under the mistaken belief that it is comprehensive.
“This will create citizens who are poorly informed about important issues of the day and be detrimental to the proper functioning of society in the long run,"" she said. 
“Meaningful participation in political and social life cannot be based on the consumption of just entertainment-related news."" 
On the other hand, if consumers are aware that social media platforms are downplaying news over other types of content, this could encourage audiences to turn to established and verified news sources to obtain their information, Dr Wu added. This would be a positive development as it contributes to a more informed citizenry and lessens the spread of disinformation.
News outlets may also see increased traffic on their websites or apps as people realise that it is the only and best way for them to access the news from established sources. 
Consequently, having more audiences would mean more advertising revenue and more resources for news organisations to produce good quality news content, over “click-worthy and potentially viral” stories, said Dr Wu.
Ms Henson said that she hoped news consumers will eventually get tired of ""all the fluff"" coming out of social media over the years, and they will hanker for news that is objective and moderate.
She noted how there were probably more people reading the news during the COVID-19 pandemic when they realised the relevance of news to their lives. 
“There could be a time where people get so fed up with frivolity (on social media) that they do want to read something deeper, longer and better,” she said. 
WHAT SOME SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SAY
In response to TODAY’s queries, Facebook's parent company Meta said that news discovery is a “small part” of the Facebook experience for the majority of its users. 
“In fact, news article links only make up about 4 per cent of what people see in Feed and people tell us they don’t want political content to take over their experience,” said a Meta spokesperson.
The spokesperson added that Facebook renamed its “News Feed” to “Feed” in February to “better reflect the diverse types of content people see and engage with” on the feed.
“We have learned from the data that news and links to news content are not the reason the vast majority of people come to Facebook, and as a business we can’t over-invest in areas that don't align most with user preferences,” said the spokesperson.
YouTube referred TODAY to its blog by Mr Cristos Goodrow, its vice-president of engineering, which outlines how the platform approaches recommended videos.
Mr Goodrow said that the platform’s recommendation system does not connect viewers to content through their social network, but instead predicts the videos that a user wants to watch.
He noted that over the years, a growing number of viewers have turned to YouTube for news and information. While some viewers have indicated that they are very satisfied with videos perpetuating disinformation - such as those claiming that the Earth is flat - this does not mean that YouTube wants to recommend low-quality content.
As such, YouTube connects viewers to “high-quality information and minimise the chances they’ll see problematic content”, he said.
In doing so, YouTube determines the authoritativeness of a video based on several factors including its topic, the reputation of the speaker in the video, and the content.
“The higher the score, the more the video is promoted when it comes to news and information content,” said Mr Goodrow on the blog.
While TikTok did not respond to TODAY’s queries, its community guidelines specify that its mission is to “inspire creativity and bring joy”.
Among the content banned by TikTok are those that are sexually explicit or depict weapons and drugs, as well as violent or graphic deaths and accidents.
It may reduce the discoverability of some content, or make videos ineligible for recommendation on its ""For You"" feed, to ""maintain the trust and safety of its viewers"".
However, TikTok’s guidelines note that some content that would otherwise be removed under its guidelines may be in the public interest. For such content, exceptions may be allowed, such as if the video is educational, artistic or enables individual expression on a topic of social importance. 
In its content guidelines circulated to publishers, TikTok specifies that news organisations should include elements such as their logo and banners in their videos, so as to identify the content as news.
TikTok also requires violent or graphic content, such as road accidents or physical violence, to be blurred out. In content depicting criminal activity or firearms, newsrooms, where applicable, have to also convey that such incidents are illegal and should be condemned.

How Facebook algorithms can fight over your feed













WHAT'S THE WAY FORWARD FOR NEWSROOMS? 
With platforms using algorithms to curate the selection of users’ content, how can traditional newsrooms find their footing in this new-look social mediasphere? 
The industry experts interviewed offered several suggestions, such as having news organisations tailor their approaches to different platforms, setting up their own social media platforms, and finding new ways to draw consumers directly to their content. 
Prof Lim from SUTD noted that younger consumers are curating for themselves a whole suite of news sources and use social media platforms as a gateway to these.
“So they may not read one publication from end to end, but they will get whatever is trending, or the top story, from different news outlets. And the visual links and the images from Instagram or TikTok videos that lead them there are really a conduit,” she said. 
To ride on the trend, media outlets would do well to adapt to consumer behaviour and establish a presence on the social media platforms, she added. 
However, amid the moves by social media platforms to downplay news on users' feeds, Ms Lau Joon-Nie, a vice-president at media industry networking organisation Singapore Press Club, stressed that social media platforms were not created to distribute news and their algorithms “do not exist to serve newsrooms”.
Instead, their primary aim is to attract audiences, drive engagement and attract advertising.
To this end, one way forward for news organisations is to diversify their channels of news distribution. For example, they could turn to distributing online newsletters or set up their own equivalent of Facebook to reduce their dependence on existing social media platforms.
She cited the example of “Neighbourly”, a social media network in New Zealand that connects people within neighbourhoods. The platform, which is owned by New Zealand news conglomerate Stuff, also disseminates news from all its local community papers. It is the country’s second-largest social media network after Facebook.

Ms Henson reiterated that newsrooms should be less reliant on social media platforms' algorithms to disseminate the news. Instead, organisations should find ways to draw their readers back to them every day, and offer them an incentive to do so such as by offering prizes or with the promise of better content.
This would help consumers develop a habit of following the news regularly, and not just in times of crisis. The incentive to draw readers in regularly should also be left to the marketing team so that journalists can focus on their jobs instead of finding ways to ""draw eyeballs"", said Ms Henson. 
Dr Soon of IPS said that research has shown that social media users, especially those in the younger age group, are unlikely to consume any news at all if they do not see it on social media.
END OF SOCIAL NETWORKING AS WE KNOW IT
Apart from the ramifications on the news industry and the proper functioning of society, the changes that social media platforms are embarking on will also fundamentally alter the way users interact. 
While Facebook attempts to reinvent itself to keep up with newer platforms, there is no denying that many of its erstwhile users are no longer using it for the very purpose that it was originally created for - connecting people.  
Ms Nabillah Jalal, a 30-year-old piano teacher, no longer opens her Facebook as often as before. She currently uses it to keep in touch with people who are 50 and above, and to remind her of friends’ birthdays.
Like other younger users, Ms Nabillah spends more time on Instagram which she described as more “visually aesthetic”.
It is also the platform she uses to connect with friends around her age group as well as her teenage students.
Some observers believe that social networking online, which serves as most users’ main experience on the Internet, is coming to an end, with news website Axios’ technology reporter Scott Rosenberg describing Facebook as “a legacy operation”.
While previously, users’ social media experience was centred around keeping up with their friends’ posts, it will now move towards “a kind of digital mass media, in which the reactions of hordes of anonymous users … drive the selection of (a user’s) content”, he said.

However, Prof Lim believes that the social aspect of social media platforms will never go away, even if keeping up with the posts of friends stops being the key driver of algorithms in future.
“They (social media platforms) will want to be the dominant water cooler (conversation) that people converge around so they must push out stuff that everyone is keen on. They will track the virality of stories through a variety of assets, like hashtags or the nature of audience engagement,” said Prof Lim.
Neither can social media platforms completely remove news from their platforms, she said. 
Referring to TikTok’s content guidelines and its desire to ""bring joy"", Prof Lim said that it is normal for social media platforms to have guidelines to prevent objectional or unauthorised content from being uploaded. But it is not realistic for social media platforms to completely remove adverse content, including news, as they will have to reflect social realities to some extent, she reiterated.

Police warn of SMS phishing scams involving Singpass,"Victims would receive unsolicited SMSes with the sender's ID containing similarities to Singpass, such as MySingpass or SGSingpass.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-warn-sms-phishing-scams-singpass-login-details-2980726,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Sunday (Oct 2) warned of a new variant of SMS phishing scams where scammers would target victims with similar sender's ID to obtain their Singpass login credentials. 
In a news release, the police said they have seen a surge in cases where people would receive unsolicited SMSes with the sender's ID containing similarities to Singpass, such as MySingpass or SGSingpass. 
The SMSes would indicate that the recipients’ Singpass accounts had been or would be deactivated, and that they were required to conduct facial verification. They would then be required to log into Singpass through a web link provided in the messages. 
Upon clicking on the link, the victims would be directed to a spoofed Singpass login webpage, where they would be required to enter their Singpass ID and password.
They would then be led to a two-factor authentication page asking for their Singpass one-time password, said the police. 
The victims would only realise they were scammed when they received alerts from Singpass that their profiles were updated. In some cases, the victims would receive alerts that they had signed up for bank accounts and credit cards. 
In some cases, unauthorised transactions were also charged to the credit cards.
""While the authorities have taken down the phishing websites, user vigilance is crucial in our fight against evolving scams,"" said the police. 
SINGPASS DOES NOT SEND SMSES CONTAINING WEB LINKS
""The police and GovTech would like to advise members of the public to be on heightened alert,"" said the authorities. 
Members of the public were advised that Singpass does not send SMSes containing web links asking recipients to log in with their credentials, such as passwords and one-time passwords. 
The official SMS' sender identity is labelled as Singpass or SingPass. 
Singpass users can verify the authenticity of the claims against their Singpass account via the Singpass hotline at 6335 3533 and press 9 for 24-hour scam support. They should also ensure that the Singpass website domain they are accessing is singpass.gov.sg, with a ""lock"" icon in the address bar.

Users were also advised to update their contact details registered with Singpass and enable notifications via their Singpass app so that they can be promptly alerted of suspicious logins, such as when a login on a new device or Internet browser is detected.
""If you suspect that your Singpass account has been compromised, reset your Singpass password immediately,"" said the police. 
Log-ins to Government services should only be done at websites with domains ending with "".gov.sg"". If a link received does not end with "".gov.sg"", users should check it against the list of trusted websites at www.gov.sg/trusted-sites. 
The police also advised users to never disclose their personal or Internet banking details and one-time passwords to anyone and to report any fraudulent transactions to their bank immediately.

Singapore re-elected to governing body of UN aviation agency ICAO,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-reelected-icao-council-aviation-2980621,"SINGAPORE: Singapore was successfully re-elected to the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), retaining the seat it has held in the organisation's governing body since 2003.
The elections took place at the 41st session of ICAO's assembly held in Montreal, Canada on Saturday (Oct 1), the Ministry of Transport said in a press release on Sunday.
""Singapore is firmly committed to supporting ICAO in its unwavering efforts to build a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for international aviation,"" said Transport Minister S Iswaran.
""We stand ready to work with all stakeholders and partners to contribute to these efforts for the benefit of all states.""
Singapore was first elected to the ICAO council in 2003, at an extraordinary assembly session that was convened to fill three new council seats. It was re-elected in 2004 and in subsequent elections, which happens once every three years.
The country participates in more than 100 ICAO panels and expert groups. It takes the lead role in some of these panels and groups, to ""help shape international standards in areas such as aviation safety and security; air traffic management; and environmental protection"", said the Transport Ministry.
In its press release, the ministry also noted that Singapore is making significant contributions to human capital development in aviation, highlighting the work done by the Singapore Aviation Academy (SAA), which is the training arm of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).
""Through the SAA and its partnerships with other leading international aviation organisations, and academic and training institutions, Singapore has also established various platforms for aviation leaders and experts to exchange insights and put forward ideas to advance international civil aviation,"" said the ministry."
"14.5km of cycling paths completed in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Toa Payoh",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cycling-paths-ang-mo-kio-bishan-toa-payoh-2979831,"SINGAPORE: Residents in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Toa Payoh can now cycle more conveniently between and within their towns with the completion of 14.5km of new cycling paths.
In a media release on Saturday (Oct 1), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) gave an update on the ongoing development of cycling paths in Singapore.
Seven kilometres of cycling paths have been added in Ang Mo Kio, expanding on the existing 4km, LTA said.
""The new paths will provide stronger first-and-last-mile connectivity to Mayflower and Lentor MRT stations.""
The wider cycling path network also provides easy access to amenities in the area such as town centres, hawker centres and parks, as well as schools including Ang Mo Kio Primary and Secondary, Townsville Primary and Pathlight Schools.
LTA noted that creating space for new infrastructure in mature towns may require more extensive works. The authority added that it worked closely with other agencies and organisations to repurpose road space along Ang Mo Kio Street 22 and 43. 
""In particular, two lanes along Ang Mo Kio Street 43 were converted to new cycling paths to provide a safer and more comfortable experience for walking and cycling. Such measures help us create a more inclusive land transport system, that benefits pedestrians, cyclists, and the community.""
Works are still ongoing for another 16km of cycling paths, slated for completion in 2026. These paths will cover most main roads in Ang Mo Kio town, the new Linear Park running along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 and within Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East, which will connect the park to Ang Mo Kio MRT station.
Barrier-free access to the park will also be provided for seamless connectivity. When implemented, the total network of cycling paths for Ang Mo Kio Town will span 27km, LTA said.

BISHAN AND TOA PAYOH
Close to 4km of the planned 7.7km Bishan Town cycling path network has been completed, LTA said. Residents can cycle from Ang Mo Kio to Bishan town, with access to Bishan MRT through the park. 
The network also complements the existing Kallang Park Connector, providing Bishan residents with active mobility connectivity to Kallang Riverside Park.
The remaining 3.7 km of the cycling path is expected to be completed in 2023. When finished, Bishan residents will be able to cycle seamlessly to reach key amenities within the town, said LTA.
About 3.5 km of cycling paths in Toa Payoh Town have been completed, with the remaining 5.5km slated for completion in 2023.
LTA said that completed cycling paths will progressively open for use once they are ready for residents to immediately enjoy their benefits.
""When fully completed, the Toa Payoh cycling path network will provide active mobility connectivity to Braddell and Toa Payoh MRT stations, key amenities such as HDB Hub, markets, parks as well as schools in the town.""

THE ISLANDWIDE CYCLING NETWORK PROGRAMME
The LTA's Islandwide Cycling Network programme aims to expand the cycling paths island-wide to around 1,300km by 2030, allowing active mobility users to travel safely and seamlessly to their destinations.
The programme is a key pillar in efforts to foster a safe and gracious active mobility landscape, LTA said.
""Our infrastructural enhancement efforts go hand in hand with regulatory measures to address path and device safety concerns.""
The authority noted that regulations on device specifications, speed limits and where devices can be used are firmly in place. 
Other measures to detect and stem the inflow of non-compliant devices, including periodic inspections of e-scooters and import controls on motorised personal mobility devices and power-assisted bicycles, have also been introduced.
These efforts have resulted in a significantly safer active mobility landscape, LTA said, adding that the number of active mobility-related accidents on public paths and fires incidents have dropped by around 50 per cent over the last two years.
The number of offences detected on public paths have also decreased, as the public grows accustomed to the new active mobility rules after ""after strict enforcement and concerted public education efforts"".
""The number of accidents on paths fell from 303 in 2019 to 155 in 2021, while the number of fires involving motorised active mobility devices fell from 116 in 2019 to 63 in 2021,"" said LTA.
""LTA will continue to promote the take-up of active mobility through expanding our cycling infrastructure as well as keeping up our public education and enforcement efforts to ensure safety for all path users.""

After a schedule is drawn up, a maintenance team checks the inventory which is kept at a 38,000 sq m storage facility in Tampines. The team ensures that the equipment from the last race is present, and tests the lighting fixtures to ensure they are in working order.
“Before bringing everything here (to the track), we have to be sure that the area has already been cleared,” Mr Grilli told CNA.
About 1,600 floodlights have to be set up along the track, and more than 220km of cables need to be laid.

The set-up usually begins by mid-June, and the first test of the lights by the end of August.
“The first switching on (of the lights) will be just a few weeks before the race,” said Mr Grilli.
“During (that time) we do all the troubleshooting, we make sure that everything works properly, that the lights are in a good shape and we start with aiming (of the light) as well.”
The number of people involved in the initial installation is only 25, but this gradually increases and will eventually grow to more than 100 during the race weekend.

While there are other night races on the F1 calendar, Mr Grilli pointed out that the lighting fixtures for those circuits are permanent, unlike the ones in Singapore.
“(Here), it is the only temporary installation in terms of infrastructure, of cabling, so it’s like starting from scratch every year,” he said. “Here, every year is a new challenge.”
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
Having quality lighting for a track like Singapore’s is important, emphasised Mr Grilli.
Given that the race is broadcast all over the world, it is integral for the viewing experience, he pointed out.

“If you need to have very good TV broadcasting quality, you need to have a good lighting level so that the show and the race can be seen everywhere in the world and everyone can enjoy it,” he said.
“The lighting level has to be consistent but it is also more important to have a very good uniformity, because in TV … you need to have a very good quality of the images and to have it, it is better to have the same level of lighting everywhere (on track).”
While there are street lights all along the Marina Bay circuit, these are insufficient for the race, Mr Grilli added.

“You cannot really consider (it) for a motorsport event. It's just nice to see and it's just good to use when you're driving your own car. But when you have a motorsport event, of course you need to have something much more powerful.”
Having proper lighting is not only for crisp TV images but helps minimise glare on track, Mr Grilli added.
This prevents driver accidents, allows race marshals to carry out tasks and ensures that the public has an optimum viewing experience, Mr Grilli said.
Light temperatures for the Singapore GP are also maintained at a precise 4200K (Kelvin).
“We don't need to use too much light … First of all, it is a wastage ... And second, you might even have more trouble with glare and everything else,” he said.

The energy consumption for the lighting up of the race track is less than an average-sized shopping mall, added Mr Grilli.
As part of its push for sustainability, the Singapore Grand Prix will convert all track lights to LED lighting in 2023. 
This would be a ""technological step forward"", said Mr Grilli. Nothing will change for DZ Engineering, and it will still integrate the lighting systems next year, he added.
Days before the race and during practice sessions, Mr Grilli’s team also gets feedback from the International Automobile Federation as well as teams and drivers.
“Usually (the feedback) is on Thursday, when there is a safety car that is testing the track. So if we have something that they might want to change … we can do it immediately after.”
RACE DAY
Race day is a busy affair for Mr Grilli and his staff.
They are divided into various teams. One team is stationed in the control room, where they keep a close eye on the various systems.
“We know if the lights are working, we know if there is any switch that trips, we know everything from there,” said Mr Grilli.

“Each one of them is … very focused in one of the systems and there is of course someone that overall supervises the entire solution.”
There are also four to five people - including an electrician, a mechanic and a superintendent - assigned to each of the 12 power generation stations along the track. These stations help power the lights for a certain section of the track.
“We have few people … that can act immediately if something is not working properly, in terms of mechanical and electrical in terms of lighting. So every single generation area will actually have a group of people able to act and react in real time,” added Mr Grilli.

While having a decade’s worth of experience has helped the team, Mr Grilli explained that there are still nerves.
“You are still not relaxed until the race is over,” he said.
But having the experience of lighting up the track over the years has helped, added Mr Grilli, who was also involved in the lighting up of the first Formula E night race in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.
“Over the years there have been some minor changes on the track and of course we have to follow as well in terms of lighting,"" he added. Preparations for this year's races began at the end of May.

The completion of another successful race brings a sense of satisfaction, said Mr Grilli, who was the project manager during the first night race in Singapore.
He recalled the sense of pride he felt after the 2008 Grand Prix, and added that Singapore has a “special place” in his heart until today.
“It was something that really was a game changer, in terms of my professional life as well.
“I thought after the first few events that the kind of feeling and emotion was going to be different, but no ... When one event is delivered, the kind of feeling and emotion is always the same.”"
"Delays at some hospitals, polyclinics on Sep 29 due to disruption to electronic medical system","The disruption affected hospitals and polyclinics under the National Healthcare Group and the National University Health System.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/delays-polyclinics-hospitals-nhg-nuhs-sep-29-registration-appointments-2973641,"SINGAPORE: A disruption to the electronic medical record system caused delays in registration and longer wait times on Thursday (Sep 29) at hospitals and polyclinics under the National Healthcare Group (NHG) and the National University Health System (NUHS).
Some non-urgent appointments had to be rescheduled.
""Patients who required urgent medical assistance were promptly attended to,"" said NHG, NUHS and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) on Saturday in response to CNA's queries on Thursday. 
""Staff on the ground helped to support and assist patients, in view of some delay in registration and longer wait times. Patients who fasted as part of their medical procedures were offered drinks and biscuits to cope as necessary.""
The healthcare institutions affected on Thursday include Woodlands Polyclinic and Yishun Polyclinic.
Mr A Kannan, who had a blood test scheduled that morning, told CNA that he faced issues getting a queue number on his HealthHub app before his appointment.
Patients can usually get a queue number on the app 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time.
Mr Kannan then left home earlier to get a queue number from the self-help terminals at Woodlands Polyclinic but said the terminals were ""shut down"", describing the situation there as ""chaotic"".
""Staff told the patients to obtain a queue number manually, reschedule their appointments, or contact the contact centre,"" he told CNA.
He added that his wife, who had another appointment at the same polyclinic, was also told to reschedule it due to the outage.
""We then decided not to wait as we were told to prepare to wait for two to three hours to be called,"" Mr Kannan said, adding that he would have to wait for the polyclinic to contact him for his next appointment.
""There was no announcement on the HealthHub on the situation at the polyclinic and calling the helplines did not help either.""
Another CNA reader who did not want to be named said she faced similar issues with the self-help terminals at Yishun Polyclinic when she arrived at 9.50am for her 10am appointment.
""I was attended to immediately,"" she said, adding that polyclinic employees at the entrance told her that the ""entire system was down"", with a waiting time of two to three hours.
A polyclinic staff member advised her to head home instead and reschedule the appointment via the HealthHub app when the system is up.
""It would be better if there was an SMS alert or announcement on their Facebook page to inform the affected patients,"" she said.
""Most were turned away, but those who did not mind waiting still queued to register.""
In their joint reply to CNA's queries, NHG, NUHS and IHiS said they received reports of users experiencing difficulties accessing the electronic medical record system at about 3.40am on Sep 29.
""The affected institutions activated their business continuity measures,"" they said, adding that the system was restored at 1pm on the same day.
""We are monitoring the situation and the system is stable,"" said NHG, NUHS and IHiS.
""We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused and convey our appreciation to patients, staff and members of the public for their patience and kind understanding while the system was being restored.""

System outages at healthcare institutions caused by hardware failure, not lack of manpower: Janil Puthucheary 













On Aug 27, patients at some polyclinics had their appointments delayed or rescheduled after system outages, according to a report by the Straits Times. 
The public healthcare monitoring systems detected IT network connectivity failures, which affected 17 public healthcare institutions, including community hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics and all polyclinics.
Another incident occurred on Sep 5 when a fault was detected in the IT infrastructure.
The disruption affected eight public healthcare institutions and two out of three polyclinic groups, according to Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary, who gave an update on the matter in Parliament in September. 
He added that the two IT system outages at healthcare institutions on Aug 27 and Sep 5 were caused by failures of hardware devices in data centres, not a lack of manpower.

"About 7 in 1,000 students caught for smoking and vaping offences over past 3 years: MOE","The average number of students caught for smoking and vaping offences has ""remained low"" over the past three years, says the Ministry of Education. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/students-vaping-smoking-offences-remained-low-moe-disciplinary-action-2979251,"SINGAPORE: The number of students caught for smoking and vaping offences has ""remained low"" at an average of about 7 for every 1,000 students over the past three years, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Saturday (Oct 1). 
The figure covers students in primary school, secondary school and pre-university institutions, the ministry said in response to CNA queries. 
""The Ministry of Education takes a firm stand against vaping,"" it added.
""We work closely with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) to remind students that vaping is illegal at any age, and to also review guidelines and cessation efforts for student offenders.""
The legal age for smoking in Singapore is 21.
And although the use, purchase and possession of e-vaporisers were banned in Singapore from February 2018, such products continue to be sold online and smuggled into the country.
HSA said earlier this year that there has been a significant increase in vaping cases. Teenagers and even primary school students are picking up the habit, a student health adviser told CNA in June.
When a student is caught committing smoking or vaping offences, the products are confiscated, said MOE.
The schools then impose ""appropriate disciplinary actions"" such as detention, suspension or caning for boys, depending on the severity of the offence. 
They are also reported to HSA, which will fine and take action against recalcitrant offenders, MOE said in its statement.

Offenders are also referred to Student Health Advisors, as well as programmes meant to help them quit smoking. MOE said it also works with the students' parents to support them.
""Where necessary, schools may also conduct longer term preventive programmes with students in need of greater support,"" the Education Ministry said. 
In character and citizenship education lessons across the primary, secondary and pre-university levels, students learn to ""recognise impulsive and addictive behaviours"" that harm their mental and physical well-being. 
They also learn about strategies to develop self-control and manage negative peer influences, said MOE in its statement.
""Through the lessons, students are encouraged to make responsible decisions by considering how their actions can affect themselves and others. They are also encouraged to look out for peers in need and refer them to a trusted adult,"" said the Education Ministry. 
On top of the school curriculum, schools partner HPB to educate students on the health risks of vaping, said the ministry.  
""MOE also works closely with HPB to educate parents on the health risks associated with students using prohibited tobacco products such as vaporisers."" 
Singapore has seen a rise in the number of people caught using and possessing vapes. In an update on Sep 27, HSA said 3,912 people were caught for these offences between January and August this year.
In 2021, 4,697 people were caught for the same offence, more than triple the figure of 1,266 in the previous year.
A total of 428 people were caught selling vapes from 2018 to August 2022. Ninety-one were prosecuted in the same period. 
Offenders found to be selling, possessing for sale, importing or distributing e-vaporisers can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both for the first offence.
Repeat offenders could be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both."

During his address to Russia's political elite, Putin said that the move, which has been condemned by the West, is irreversible and urged Ukraine to negotiate a surrender.
He signalled that he was ready to continue what he called a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"", slammed the West as out to destroy Russia and accused Washington and its allies of blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines.
“The decision by the Russian Federation to formally annex the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson violates international law and the UN Charter,"" said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Saturday.
""The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected.”

Cyber forensic experts were called in to investigate after the discovery of unauthorised activities on Shangri-La’s IT network, said the hotel chain in an email to customers on Friday night (Sep 30).
""The investigation revealed that between May and July 2022, a sophisticated threat actor managed to bypass Shangri-La’s IT security monitoring systems undetected and illegally accessed the guest databases,"" said Mr Brian Yu, Shangri-La Group's senior vice president of operations and process transformation.
The affected hotels are the Island Shangri-La, Kerry Hotel and Kowloon Shangri-La in Hong Kong, Singapore's Shangri-La Apartments and Shangri-La Singapore, Shangri-La Chiang Mai, Shangri-La Far Eastern in Taipei and Shangri-La Tokyo.
""The investigation confirmed that certain data files had been exfiltrated from these databases,"" said Mr Yu.
The databases contained a combination of guest names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, Shangri-La Circle membership numbers, reservation dates and company names. 
""We can assure you that information such as passport numbers, ID numbers, dates of birth, and credit card numbers with expiry dates are encrypted,"" Mr Yu said, adding that there has been no evidence so far that the personal data has been released by third parties or misused. 
""Nevertheless, as an added precaution, we are also offering affected guests a one-year complimentary identity monitoring service provided by Experian, a third-party service provider, in destinations where local regulation permits.""
The identity monitoring service is optional and guests can decide how much information to include.
Shangri-La Group said it is cooperating with the relevant authorities on the matter.
Apologising to guests in the email, Mr Yu said: ""Protecting our guests’ information is very important to us and we wish to assure you that all necessary steps have been taken to further strengthen the security of our networks, systems and databases.""
The 19th Shangri-La Dialogue, organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), took place from Jun 10 to Jun 12. 
Responding to CNA's queries, IISS said data related to the Shangri-La Dialogue was stored on a separate server and was not affected in the breach. 
Established in 2002, the dialogue serves as the premier defence and security conference in the Asia-Pacific region.
Visitors to this year's summit included Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe.

Government to set up new corporate entity to manage its migrant worker dormitories,"NEST Singapore Limited will manage both purpose-built dormitories at Tukang Innovation Lane in Jurong and Sengkang West, in partnership with the private sector.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/migrant-worker-purpose-built-dormitories-new-corporate-entity-nest-singapore-living-conditions-2979111,"SINGAPORE: A new corporate entity will be set up by the Government to manage its purpose-built migrant worker dormitories, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Saturday (Oct 1). 
It was previously announced that the ministry will build and own these dormitories, as part of efforts to improve living conditions and support for migrant workers. 
The new corporate entity, called NEST Singapore Limited, will manage the purpose-built dormitories, starting with two upcoming ones at Tukang Innovation Lane in Jurong and Sengkang West.
A ground-breaking ceremony was held on Saturday for the Tukang dormitory, which is expected to be operational by 2025 with 2,400 beds. 
The Sengkang West dormitory is targeted to be ready by 2028, housing 7,200 beds. 
NEST Singapore Limited will be set up in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a Company Limited by Guarantee under MOM with its own board. 
In partnership with the private sector, NEST will bring onboard expertise and insights from within and outside the dormitory industry, including from “non-traditional” operators such as those in hospitality and technology, said a ministry spokesperson at the event.
NEST’s direct involvement in operating the new purpose-built dormitories will support “driving innovation and showcasing standards” in migrant worker housing, as well as allow MOM to grow its dormitory management capabilities, the ministry added in its press release.
It will also help the ministry better design policies, regulations and initiatives for migrant worker housing, said MOM.
Addressing concerns of potential conflict of interest, MOM’s spokesperson said that the existing regulations that apply to all purpose-built dormitories will also be applicable to those operated by NEST. 
“NEST also has not and will not receive any privileged information of PBD (purpose-built dormitory) regulations and standards that will appear to give them an advantage in operating the PBDs. Over the operating period of the PBDs, NEST is also expected to be financially sustainable,” said the spokesperson.

BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE DORMITORIES  
The Manpower Ministry announced in September 2021 that all new migrant worker dormitories will have to meet improved standards.
These efforts to improve living conditions, reduce the density in dormitories and boost resilience against future pandemics came after COVID-19 infected tens of thousands of migrant workers living in dormitories.
“Our vision is for these PBDs to be living environments which are conducive for the health and the well-being of our migrant workers,” said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Saturday. 
“The PBDs will be built to the improved standards for new dormitories, in order to strengthen public health resilience and liveability.” 
Dormitories will be required to have more spacious rooms with occupancy caps and en-suite toilets, improved ventilation, as well as “modularised and segmented” communal facilities, MOM stated in its press release.

At Tukang purpose-built dormitory, migrant workers can look forward to green spaces and various outdoor recreation spaces in the form of multi-purpose courts to play sports.
These outdoor spaces will be “repurposed as medical facilities during future disease outbreaks”, the ministry said.
Cricket enthusiasts will have two cricket practice lanes where they can hone their skills.

As for indoor recreation spaces, migrant workers at the Tukang dormitory will have access to an open void deck area where they can hold activities and events, multi-purpose rooms and an indoor gym. 
The gym will be larger than what is set out under the improved dormitory standards, given that gyms are “popular amenities” among residents, said MOM. 
And within the dormitory's surrounding area, commercial amenities like a minimart, canteen, barber, ATM corner and an outdoor refreshment area will cater to residents’ daily needs. 
These amenities will also be accessible to migrant workers in the neighbouring community.

HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY, STRENGTHENING ""HEARTWARE""  
MOM will also explore technological solutions to “innovate and pilot new ideas for dormitory living and management”, said the ministry. 
These solutions include facilitating in-room access to services in the dormitories, virtual training and video conferencing. 
To foster better community support for migrant workers, MOM will encourage “greater co-development of recreational programmes and activities” within the dormitories by working with residents and non-governmental organisations.

One example of innovation in community support is the “Dad in Dorms” group that has been set up by the operator of Tee Up Dormitory. It allows fellow fathers living apart from their families to get together, share advice and support one another. 
“The ‘heartware’ or ‘software’ of communal living lies in its people. Physical infrastructure alone cannot transform the communal living environment for our migrant workers,” said Dr Tan. 
“We hope that this will create a living environment where residents can rest, where they can recharge comfortably after a hard day’s work, and forge strong bonds with their fellow dormitory residents – a place that can be their home away from home.”"

In fact, Madam Teo herself woke at 1am and refused to head back to bed. Laughing, she said she was afraid of oversleeping. 
All too soon, the car reaches the shuttered coffee shop and the family begin unloading their goods and bringing them to their stall using the back door. At this time, only the char kway teow stall owner and another coffee shop employee – there to keep an eye on the filming – are present.

Like clockwork, the four family members begin cooking the starchy broth, the noodles and other handmade ingredients like prawn rolls, dumplings, pork balls and pork belly. They work mostly in silence, comfortable in their roles. But hours in, dad Toh Pee Tian tells this reporter that his wife is not usually this quiet. 
“Luckily you all are here today, or else she will be scolding and asking everyone to hurry up,” he said goodnaturedly, setting a basin of braised pork belly on a table. 
By all accounts, Mdm Teo is the matriarch whose sharp tongue has been a source of fear for her children since young. 
Now 62, Mdm Teo still nags, but has mellowed since her three children decided to set aside their own careers to help with the family business. It came as a relief after Mdm Teo nearly shut the stall in 2020 from sheer fatigue. 
Under the lead of the young ones, Yew Tee Feng Zhen Lor Mee has been given a new lease of life. The family business has undergone more change in the past two years than Mdm Teo has seen in as many decades.
Now she is fervently hoping that the younger generation can help her achieve her dream of opening a restaurant that can showcase her culinary repertoire.
















THE FLEDGLING YEARS
Raised to help out at her own mother’s canteen stall from young, the Mandarin-and Hokkien-speaking Mdm Teo only attended school until the age of eight.
After that, she began working to support her five siblings. Work became her sole focus, even as Mdm Teo married at age 16 to Mr Toh, then an odd job labourer. Despite the young family’s efforts, money was tight and things became worse when Mr Toh’s various businesses failed to take off.
By the 1990s, Mr Toh’s failed ventures put the family in heavy debt. Then with three young children to feed, Mdm Teo decided to turn to what she did best to help the family finances – cooking.
Borrowing a few thousand dollars from her mother and tapping on the family’s meagre savings, Mdm Teo took a leap of faith, renting the Yew Tee S11 coffee shop stall when it became available. She named the stall Feng Zhen Lor Mee, after herself.

Mdm Teo said in Mandarin: “At first I wanted to do something simple like … noodles, but not many people were doing lor mee – why not I try lor mee to see if I can sell it? Then slowly, some customers said ‘hey it’s not bad’. Occasionally I would slip up and customers would say ‘hey today’s lor mee isn’t very good’.
“When I heard that I would feel very upset, so I thanked them for telling me and promised that I would improve. So I slowly started improving from there.”
Eventually, Mdm Teo sought to expand. She opened a second stall at Taman Jurong Hawker Centre in 2003 which her husband ran. However when Mr Toh began falling ill, Mdm Teo was forced to give the stall to her mother, who eventually came to be mistaken as the founder of the business. 
Now run by Mdm Teo’s brother, Taman Jurong Feng Zhen is a separate enterprise from the original Feng Zhen Lor Mee, with a different menu and recipe. Jaycee, the marketing brain behind the Yew Tee stall, made the decision to rebrand the business to Yew Tee Feng Zhen Lor Mee in a bid to differentiate the two entities. 
Expansion took a backseat for Mdm Teo, as did dreams of her own restaurant. But hawkering would soon come to define the family’s way of life, with the children caught up in Mdm Teo’s dedication to her craft and determination to please her customers.

CHILDHOOD STRUGGLES: “SCARY”, “AFRAID”, “EMBARRASSED” 
The year is 1997. Seven-year-old Jaycee is woken up by her mother hours before dawn to help out at the lor mee stall. There’s no sleeping in for the young girl, who trudges alongside her two older brothers, bleary-eyed and groggy, to the hot and dark coffee shop to start the morning’s prep work cutting chilli, rolling dumplings and stuffing fish paste into vegetables.
This was not the life that eldest son Han Zhong had envisioned as a 14-year-old teenager. All he wanted to do was hang out with friends. All his mother wanted him to do was serve customers lor mee. 
He characterises his early memories of the stall as “Scary. Afraid. Tired.”
“Whenever we disobey her orders, she will scold us very fiercely or nag at us very frequently. Just nag or scold us or raise her voice, causing us to have a phobia,” he told CNA from the family’s flat in Bukit Panjang. 
He felt then that his time at the stall was a “waste” of his youth as he could not enjoy himself or play with friends. 
Likewise, Jaycee’s earliest memories of the stall were filled with reprimands – often when her mother deemed her work to be sub-par.
“She is someone who has a very high standard in her food quality. So she's not like other mothers who would be very gentle to you. She is someone who is very short-tempered and for her, she wants to deliver a very good bowl of lor mee to people so whenever customers feedback or what, if she knows that we are the ones preparing, she would just 'blast' us, saying why didn't we do a good job,” Jaycee said.
She remembered how she ruined a ladyfinger while trying to stuff fish paste into the delicate stalk.
“It’s not that easy for a seven-year-old kid I suppose, 'cause you need skills to really (pluck open) the ladyfinger to put the fish paste. So there are times when I spoiled the ladyfinger and she would scream at me.”
Crying would only annoy her mother further, Jaycee quipped.

Even slicing the chilli padi was a measure of standard for Mdm Teo, who insisted that chilli pieces had to be cut evenly.
When a young Jaycee unwittingly rubbed her eyes while cutting chilli and panicked over the resulting burn, her mother simply told her to wash her eyes.
“She would tell us ‘go and wash your eyes, go and take the ice and rub on your eyes. Then you just sit down like that and wait, you will feel better later’. Then she would be busy cooking and serving customers and she would just put you to one side.
“It's like the whole of her life is lor mee,” Jaycee observed with a chuckle.
As Jaycee entered her teenage years, she became embarrassed to be seen at the stall, where patrons would call her “lor mee mei (sister)”. She was also deathly afraid of being seen by classmates in her “auntie” clothing. 
All three children described how Mdm Teo’s dedication to her work often came at the expense of supervising her children. 
“My studies weren’t very good back then. Often our teachers would call my mum to talk about the three kids not doing well in their academics. My mum will just flare at us again but she doesn’t know the root cause, she doesn’t know that is her problem to really supervise her kids,” Jaycee said. 
Her second brother Du Han Chuan, now 38, would run to the nearby playground with friends at every opportunity he could – until his mother screamed for his return. 
“That time she was so scary you know,"" he said, adding that the siblings ""shivered"" at the sound of her voice. “Back then I didn’t like helping out at the hawker, cause (it was) very tiring, sticky, sweaty and hot.”
But it is Mdm Teo’s brand of tough love that prepared her children for the demands of hawker life, paving the way for their return years down the road.

BECOMING SECOND-GENERATION HAWKERS
As they outgrew their fear of their mother’s tongue, the trio began to understand the reasons behind her frequent outbursts and nagging. 
“Initially, we could not understand her thinking, like why is she so rigid over every single thing that we do in terms of operation. Then slowly as we took over to help her we realised that her motive is very simple. It’s just to deliver good quality (food),” said Jaycee.
Han Zhong was the first to put aside his own career to help his mother run the business after workers started to quit on her. 
“My mum's very hardworking in her own career … It's better not to give up lah. My mum is getting older and older so I think it’s better to help out,” he said with a shrug. He simply quit his job. 
His younger brother Han Chuan decided to join the family business full-time after getting retrenched from his administrative job in an investment firm.
“You see them getting older and older,"" he said about his parents. ""They really (have a) shortage of manpower … the (workload) is very high for them.""

By then, the three children had witnessed firsthand their mother’s trips to the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for body aches and pains.
Compounding the wear-and-tear was Mdm Teo’s occasional falls in the course of being a hawker. Years ago, she slipped on a stray bottle cap outside her stall and hit her head against a pillar. 
She continued to work even as blood streamed from the back of her head – simply using a cloth to stem the flow – until her husband insisted that she see a doctor. On another occasion, she fell and chipped her tooth. 
Just a month ago, she slipped again and hit the same area on the back of her scalp. She still feels the pain today.

“I WILL SETTLE FOR YOU”
Jaycee was the last sibling to join the business full-time. 
Driven by her parents’ quarrels over money, she took on part-time stints in her teenage years, from retail to service jobs. Busy earning her own keep, she soon drifted away from the stall. 
She returned to help out from time to time after getting a full-time job in the public service when she was 21. This went on for close to a decade until April 2020, when her mother called her on the phone on the verge of a breakdown.
Crying, she told Jaycee that she was tired and didn't know if she could continue running the stall. Her dad's health was not good and the stall was only operating three to four days a week.
“Customers kept telling her ‘did you all strike the lottery, is that why you are always not open’ and ‘are you all rich now that’s why you don’t have to work anymore?’ My mum was very affected ... so she just declared she didn’t want to do it anymore.”
In that instant, Jaycee made the decision to quit her job.
“I told her that business is doing well, why do you have to give up. Just give me a while ... I will settle for you.
""Then (my mother) said ‘actually my dream is to open a restaurant, can any of you fulfil that wish?’ Then I was like ‘we definitely will, give me a bit of time’.” 
Her mother told her to think it over. Jaycee’s colleagues, bosses and even her human resources manager asked if she was sure. But she had made up her mind.
True to her word, Jaycee wrapped up her last project and left the public service months later, drawing to a close 10 years of corporate life.
Then 30, she swapped her high heels, makeup and dresses for black rubber clogs, denim shorts and a shirt imprinted on the back with the stall’s slogan “You are my lor mee o (a play on the word Romeo)” in Mandarin. She also took a pay cut of 70 per cent.

Early nights and mornings were a struggle for Jaycee, already used to the nine-to-six of corporate life. She continued to be nagged at by her mother for referring to recipe notes while cooking, or for failing to remember customer orders.
But Jaycee’s efforts soon bore fruit. Within two months, she opened Yew Tee Feng Zhen Lor Mee’s second outlet at Devan Nair Institute in Jurong East. A third branch in Bukit Merah Central launched on Monday. The family also participated in the food fair held at the Singapore Expo in mid-September, and plans to take part in more events to gain more exposure for the brand. 
Jaycee is also experimenting with marketing tools completely new to her mother, including getting her family to do the voiceovers for a cartoon about the business.
The eventual goal, she said, is to have an outlet in “every corner” of Singapore. Whether these come in the form of hawker stalls, or Mdm Teo’s dream restaurant, remains to be seen.

      Drawing aspiring hawkers to the trade
  

Several government initiatives are in place to encourage potential hawkers to enter a trade widely seen as physically tough and dogged by long hours. 
In 2018, the Incubation Stall Programme was launched to offer pre-fitted hawker stalls at subsidised rent for the initial 15 months. 
However, the programme saw limited success, with just 39 hawkers signing up between 2019 and 2021, according to a written parliamentary reply by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu.
The Hawkers' Development Programme, launched in 2020, offers participants a two-month apprenticeship with veteran hawkers. 
Close to 400 took part in this scheme, Ms Fu said. About 70 per cent of the participants were below 50 years old.
The National Environment Agency has also launched the Hawkers Succession Scheme to help retiring hawkers pass down their skills and stalls to successors.

WHAT REGULARS SAY
As the hour nears 6am, the four family members pick up their pace noticeably. The sky remains dark, but already customers stream through the back door of the coffee shop to order lor mee. 
The shutters pull up minutes later and business starts in earnest as the sky begins to brighten. 
An early crowd forms and one familiar face who appears is Mr Fred Fok, who has frequented the store since 1998 – the second year of the stall’s debut.
“(Han Zhong and I) grew up together,” said the 47-year-old, who spoke to CNA over a steaming bowl of his favourite lor mee dish – no egg or cut chilli – on Saturday morning. The technician is so familiar with Mdm Teo and her family that he calls Jaycee “younger sister” and Han Zhong “elder brother”. 
“Personally, I like what they do, seeing their preparations. A lot of times in the morning when the lights are not on yet, I can see the way they prepare. I appreciate the way they do not deceive customers. The ingredients are really there,” Mr Fok said.

As the queue builds, other familiar faces appear, such as couple Gavin Seah, 29, and Mitch Lin, 32, who had their typical order – one large bowl of lor mee each with a shared prawn roll and fish cutlet – to kick off their weekend dates. 
Yew Tee Feng Zhen Lor Mee has been such a significant part of their lives that it featured in the couple’s pre-wedding shots late last year. 
“Usually every weekend we will make a trip down to the stall for lunch and it became a frequent thing over the last few years, part of our dating days before we got married. We’ve always looked forward to our ‘lor mee date’,” Mr Seah, an author, told CNA over the phone. 
“It became something that was quite memorable for us. So when we thought about wanting to create a pre-wedding shoot, we wanted it to be something that we can look back and say that definitely defines our great dating memories.”
The couple, who got hitched in March this year, was pictured in bridal wear posing in front of Yew Tee Feng Zhen Lor Mee and enjoying their lor mee in its signature takeaway containers at the coffee shop.

The day’s work is not done even when the last bowl of lor mee is doled out at around 1pm to 2pm.
The family cleans up and returns home, where they continue prepping for the next day, cutting yam, mincing garlic and steaming trays of soya beancurd. It’s only towards evening when they can finally retire for the day, and Mdm Teo rests her weary legs. 
Despite all her aches, Mdm Teo said she will not take a back seat. Not until the day her customers tell her that her children have done well.
“I tell the regulars that my children are doing it. You try it and if there are any problems let me know, my children will accept it. If it’s not good, let them know. A lot of customers come and tell me it’s not bad, you can let go now, you really can let go. They can do it. 
“When customers tell me this then slowly I will let go.”

In its fortnightly outlook, the Met Service also forecast moderate to heavy thundery showers over Singapore in the afternoon during the first weekend of the month.
This is due to the ""convergence of low-level winds in the region"", it said.
Widespread thundery showers with occasional gusty winds between the pre-dawn hours and morning are also expected on some days, due to the development of Sumatra squalls.
Total rainfall for the first half of the month is likely to be above average over most parts of the island, the Met Service said.
Daily temperatures are forecast to fall between 24 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius on most days. However, the wet weather may bring temperatures of between 23 degrees Celsius and 32 degrees Celsius on a few days.

SEPTEMBER REVIEW
There were more showers in the second half of September as compared to the first half, the Met Service said, with the highest total daily total rainfall of 127.6mm recorded around Tuas South on Sep 25.
""On several days of the month, moderate to heavy thundery showers affected the island in the morning, extending into the early afternoon on a few days,"" it said.
Many parts of the island also saw above average rainfall in September, with Lower Pierce Reservoir in central Singapore experiencing 93 per cent above average.
Meanwhile, rainfall at Chai Chee in eastern Singapore was 23 per cent below average.
The daily maximum temperature stayed below 33 degrees Celsius on most days due to the rainy weather, which brought several days with cool night-time temperatures, it added.
There were 21 days in September when the daily minimum temperature was at 24 degrees Celsius or less. The lowest, at 21.6 degrees Celsius, was recorded at Jurong West on the morning of Sep 25."

Daily COVID-19 cases in Singapore increase by up to 40% week-on-week: MOH
Singapore has recorded a 35 per cent to 40 per cent week-on-week increase in COVID-19 daily cases, translating to 900 to 1,000 more infections every day, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Sep 30).
There has been no indication that the increase in cases has led to more severe diseases. There has also been no significant impact on Singapore’s healthcare system due to this higher number of daily infections.
The Omicron variant BA.2.75 or “Centaurus” accounted for about a quarter of all daily infections.
MOH said the main reason for the increase in cases is most likely due to social mixing and gatherings, and relaxing of rules on masks.
The proportion of reinfections also increased from about 6 per cent of all reported cases from the beginning of September, to about 10 per cent this week. However, they only account for a small proportion of the rise in cases and ""are not the main driver for the higher number of cases"", MOH said.
It says it expects higher numbers of cases over the next few weeks and will continue to monitor the situation closely.
Shares of Singapore property developers fall after new cooling measures
Shares of Singapore property developers took a hit on Friday morning (Sep 30) after cooling measures were announced late on Thursday.
The tightened housing loan limits will help homeowners exercise prudence in their purchases amid rising interest rates and cost of living, analysts said.
Another measure requires private property owners to wait 15 months before they can buy an HDB resale flat.
Analysts CNA spoke to say the wait-out period is a ""surprising turn of events"", but will likely serve as ""a form of deterrence for buyers with deep pockets"". This ruling will likely ""curb demand for private property owners who are looking for larger spaces in the HDB resale market"", said one analyst.

She advised Malaysians to be careful when accepting overseas job offers on social media and to verify the authenticity of the employers with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

"Condo owners shelving plans to downgrade, others who sold homes are stuck, say agents after cooling measures","Property agents expect the rental market as well as demand for smaller HDB flats to heat up after the Government implemented fresh cooling measures.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-cooling-measures-condo-hdb-wait-out-period-2976136,"SINGAPORE: Some condominium owners are postponing plans to cash in on their home and downgrade to an HDB flat, while those who have sold their property are now in a difficult spot, property agents told CNA on Friday (Sep 30).
These private property owners will have to enter a red-hot rental market to lease a place for more than a year before buying an HDB flat, or consider moving to a smaller but cheaper condo unit, the agents said.
This comes after the Government announced its latest property cooling measures late on Thursday, in a bid to moderate demand and ensure prudent borrowing amid rising interest rates and sky-high resale prices.
One measure imposes a 15-month wait-out period for private home owners before they can buy a non-subsidised HDB resale flat. The period will kick in after they sell their property.
This new rule will not apply to people aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat.
Previously, private home owners were allowed to buy an HDB resale flat on the open market if they sold their private properties within six months of purchasing the HDB unit.

Tighter home loan limits, new rules to cool HDB resale market: What you need to know 



















15-month wait for private home owners to buy resale HDB 'a form of deterrence for buyers with deep pockets': Analysts













PropNex agent Shafik Yusope said he has helped clients sell their condos after they signalled plans to use the extra cash to fully pay for an HDB flat.
""Their intention is the moment the proceeds come in, they would want to purchase an HDB flat,"" he said.
""But now with this cooling measure ... they cannot buy. So they are very anxious, (saying): 'Where am I going to stay? I have committed to my sale already, now I need to buy. What you want me to do?'""
RENTAL MARKET TO FURTHER HEAT UP
Mr Shafik said these owners will most likely have to rent an HDB unit during the wait-out period, although he foresees challenges with this too.
""Already at this point of time, the rental market is very difficult, meaning to say, demand is higher than supply,"" he said.
""It's going to get even hotter because these people, after downgrading, they have to rent. It's going to be a tough time for them to look for a house.""
Data from 99.co and SRX show that condominium rental prices rose by 1.7 per cent in July, rising for the 19th consecutive month, while HDB rental prices rose 1.5 per cent, the 25th consecutive increase.
Even before the cooling measures were announced, Mr Shafik said he got 50 enquiries in the first hour of advertising a ""super basic"" HDB flat in Yishun for rent. With the measures, he expects demand to skyrocket.
""Because these (condo sellers) are downgrades, they have, I would say, quite healthy proceeds. So, they have the ability to rent, financially,"" he said.
""Whether they are able to get a house for them to rent for at least 15 months, that's a different question.""
PLANS ON HOLD
Fellow PropNex agent Daron Ang said he has three clients below 55 years old who wanted to capitalise on the currently ""attractive"" condo prices by selling their home and buying an HDB flat.
According to data released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in July, prices of non-landed private properties increased by 3.6 per cent in the second quarter, compared to a 0.3 per cent decrease in the first quarter.
""They were just a bit annoyed because they were looking forward to cashing out and holding on to more cash,"" Mr Ang said.
""But right now they have to shelve their plans for at least 15 months.""

Shares of Singapore property developers fall after new cooling measures













Mr Ang, who spent the morning answering queries from concerned clients, said he is still considering how to advise these private home owners on their next move.
""If their ultimate goal was to cash out, (they can) move to a private property that is one size smaller,"" he said.
""So let's say now they're holding on to a big three-bedroom (condo) worth S$2 million plus, then at the most they just move out to a two-bedroom - if they can accept it - worth S$1.5 million. Then they cash out the difference.""
""VERY DRASTIC MEASURE""
Another property agent from ERA, who only wanted to be known by his surname Ng, said he has clients who are condo owners in their mid-40s with similar plans to ""downsize back to HDB and cash out their savings"".
These clients have to revisit their plans and consider buying a condo that is smaller or located in a more affordable area, he said.
""This is a very drastic measure that money cannot solve,"" he said, referring to how some buyers could contend with previous cooling measures that limited loan amounts or introduced extra taxes. 
""It doesn't matter how much you sell your current place for; you can't buy an HDB. So, they are a bit surprised, and so are we.""
HDB UNIT SELLERS WORRIED TOO
Mr Ng said one-third of his clients, comprising both condo and HDB sellers, were directly impacted by this measure. They texted him in the morning about their concerns, and he will meet them tonight to discuss next steps.
""I also have some HDB sellers who are also worried because these measures cut out a big portion of their prospective buyers,"" he said.
""It just so happened that this unit that I'm selling now is a five-room. So, even the 55-year-old buyers cannot purchase it as well.""
Mr Ng predicted that demand for three- and four-room resale flats will rise, especially as private home owners aged 55 or older - likely retirees - looking to downgrade can buy these units without a wait-out period.
""We expect demand for these units, especially four-room because it's a more comfortable size, to shoot up as well,"" he said."

According to an order paper released on Friday, Members of Parliament (MPs) have filed more than 90 questions on a range of topics, which also include employment issues and concerns over the mental well-being of police officers.
MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) raised the possibility of bringing forward the distribution of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers to the third quarter of 2022 instead of January next year.
He also asked if the S$100 CDC vouchers could be issued to every Singaporean aged more than 21 years old, instead of every household. 
The latest tranche of vouchers was issued to eligible Singaporean households in May, following an earlier tranche in December last year. Up to 1.22 million Singaporean households received the digital vouchers, which can be spent at hawker centres and neighbourhood stores.
Mr Ang's question was filed ""in light of persistent high inflation rates in the last few months"".
Singapore’s core inflation rose to 5.1 per cent in August, driven mainly by stronger increases in the prices of food and services. 
The last time Singapore reported higher year-on-year core inflation growth was in November 2008, when it stood at 5.5 per cent.

Dr Wan Rizal asked Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong if there were measures implemented to protect Singapore’s carded athletes from the misuse of drugs.
MP Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) asked if the Government or National Sports Associations (NSAs) have any programmes to educate national and elite athletes about the dangers and pitfalls of using recreational and performance-enhancing drugs.
Additionally, he asked if there were any programmes to regularly test athletes for use of such drugs.
Two MPs submitted questions to Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam relating to the mental health of Home Team officers, after an officer was found dead with a gunshot wound at Bayfront Avenue on Sep 19.
MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) asked if there were precautionary measures to continually assess the mental health and well-being of police and auxiliary police officers who bear arms in the course of their duties, particularly those who have front-facing duties with members of the public.
MP Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) asked about the number of Home Team officers who died during active service, and how many of these were suicide cases.
Several MPs submitted questions on employment issues.
These included one from MP Jessica Tan (PAP-East Coast) on initiatives to bring top overseas Singaporean talent back to Singapore.
She asked if there was support to help them and their families relocate and transition back to Singapore.
Meanwhile, MP Gerald Giam (Workers’ Party-Aljunied) asked Manpower Minister Tan See Leng if there were plans to review the Employment Pass scheme to introduce a new dependency ratio ceiling for the bottom half of income earners. 
This would encourage employers to enhance their Singaporean workforce by hiring and training more Singaporean talent and transferring skills from foreign employees to the local workforce, he said.
Monday's sitting will also see the introduction of four Government Bills.
These are the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, the Accountancy Functions (Consolidation) Bill, the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill and the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill.
There will also be a second reading for four other bills – the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, the Business Trusts (Amendment) Bill and the Accountants (Amendments) Bill."
F1 Singapore GP makes efforts to go green,"Based on a report released by F1 in 2019, the total emission of a single season is estimated to be more than 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide – about the same amount emitted by some countries.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/f1-singapore-gp-sustainability-recyclable-fertiliser-2976826,"SINGAPORE: Competition during the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix (GP) this year will not just be on the race track, but also in sustainability ratings.
Organisers of the event aim to make Singapore feature among the most environmentally sustainable street circuits on the race calendar by the end of the Singapore GP's seven-year term with F1.
To that end, there will be an audit on the event's carbon footprint for the first time.
""This is the first year that we're holding ourselves fully accountable by doing a carbon footprinting report. This is in hopes of developing a plan that will assist us to reach our goal of being one of the most environmentally sustainable street circuits by the end of the seven-year term,” Singapore Grand Prix director of sustainability Sasha Rafi told CNA.
The organiser’s efforts are in line with F1's goals. In 2019, F1 launched a countdown to reaching net-zero carbon by 2030 and hosting sustainable races by 2025.
Based on a report released by F1 in 2019, the total emission of a single season is estimated to be more than 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide – about the same amount emitted by some entire countries.
The biggest culprit is logistics. Transporting all the vehicles and equipment around the world accounts for almost half of total emissions, followed by business travel associated with the sport and F1-related factories and facilities.
GREEN CHANGES THIS YEAR
In Singapore, among the initiatives this year is the sale of water in recyclable cartons instead of single-use plastic bottles. There will also be 17 water refilling stations, more than double that of previous years.
Single-use plates and cups available at the event will also be different from the typical ones that are known to leave a larger carbon footprint.
Instead, the disposable tableware – made with plant-based material and provided by local startup TRIA – will be collected after use and converted into fertiliser.
“It is digestible, it can be broken down. So we further put it through our digestion technology, we can accelerate the pace rapidly, to the extent (it) can be turned into fertiliser,” said TRIA’s chief executive Ng Pei Kang.
Fertiliser producer Yara International is exploring ways to make TRIA’s fertiliser suitable for use in farming. Given that the firm’s organic fertiliser is low in nutrient density, it needs to be mixed with chemical fertiliser to give it value in the agricultural industry.
Mr Werner Prinsloo, director of Sustainability & Food Chain in Africa & Asia at Yara International, explained why his firm is eyeing TRIA’s fertiliser.
“There is no need to separate anything. And that allows us to have a more consistent organic mineral fertiliser in the end. So it's just really the ease of use and the fact that they are truly a circular packaging company,” he said.
The food and beverage kitchens in the circuit are also going green. Used cooking oil from the event will be collected and converted into a cleaner form of fuel, which will then be trialled to power a generator this year.

Mr Jack Ling, chief operations officer of Alpha Biofuels, which is turning the oil into a cleaner alternative, said that while Singapore may not have natural resources, there are ways to work around it.
“Although we don't have farm plantations, or soybean, or cornfields, we do have a lot of hawker centers and restaurants and five-star hotels. So used cooking oil is actually a resource in Singapore,” he said.
CAN F1 TRULY BE SUSTAINABLE?
An expert CNA spoke with said the measures in place to make the event more sustainable are comprehensive, but there are aspects that organisers could look at in the future.
“What they're addressing is what I call the trackside … externalities and it is pretty much comprehensive as far as I can see,” said Professor Vish Viswanathan, director of the Nanyang Technological University’s Centre for Business Sustainability.
However, he gave an example of aspects that remain unaddressed, such what happens to the tyres used during the event.
“How are they disposed of properly? Are they working with some tyre company to ensure that as much of circularity is maintained in the tyres because circularity of the tires is probably more relevant than the circularity of the food waste,” he said.
He is optimistic that when it comes to trackside emissions, organisers can set and reach net zero impact in the next three to seven years.
The Singapore Grand Prix organisers are working to make such targets come true. By next year, solar panels will be installed on top of the pit building.
Organisers are also aiming to use energy-efficient LED lighting throughout the track.

Daily COVID-19 cases in Singapore increase by up to 40% week-on-week: MOH,"This translates to 900 to 1,000 more cases every day, with the Omicron variant BA.2.75 accounting for about a quarter of all daily infections.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-cases-increase-omicron-variant-ba275-centaurus-moh-2976791,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has recorded a 35 per cent to 40 per cent week-on-week increase in COVID-19 daily cases, translating to 900 to 1,000 more infections every day, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Sep 30).
There has been no indication that the increase in cases has led to more severe diseases, the ministry said in a statement.
There has also been no significant impact on Singapore’s healthcare system due to this higher number of daily infections, it added.














MOH said the Omicron variant BA.2.75 or “Centaurus” accounted for about a quarter of all daily infections.
BA.2.75 is a sub-lineage strain of Omicron subvariant BA.2, which was responsible for triggering outbreaks in places like the United States and Hong Kong earlier this year.
The BA.2.75 variant has been around for some time, and has been detected in many countries including Australia, China, Europe, India, Malaysia and the US, said MOH on Friday.
Singapore reported its first two imported cases of the variant in July.

“It is now circulating more widely in our population, due to social mixing and gatherings, and relaxing of masking rules. This is most likely the main reason for the increase in cases,” MOH said.
“There has been no evidence of increased disease severity associated with BA.2.75 in the international literature or in our local context.""
MOH said it expects higher case numbers over the next few weeks and will continue to monitor the situation closely.
Singapore's mask-wearing rules eased from Aug 29, allowing people to go mask-free except on public transport and in healthcare facilities.
Earlier in April, group size limits as well as vaccination-differentiated safe-management measures were also removed.

INCREASE IN REINFECTIONS
The proportion of reinfections in Singapore has also increased from about 6 per cent of all reported cases from the beginning of September, to about 10 per cent this week, MOH noted.
“Notwithstanding this, reinfections account for only a small proportion of the rise in cases and are not the main driver for the higher number of cases,” it added.
MOH urged those who have not received their booster shots to do so.
Three shots of mRNA vaccine or four shots of Sinovac-CoronaVac are needed to be adequately protected against current variants of COVID-19, said the ministry.
“Members of the public are also encouraged to continue to exercise personal and social responsibility and caution, such as wearing masks when in crowded places, or when visiting or interacting with vulnerable persons,” it added.
Those who are unwell should continue to stay at home and avoid going out. If unwell when out or at the workplace, they should should go home immediately to rest or see a doctor, MOH advised.

"Tightened property loan criteria 'timely, well-calibrated'; will instil buyer 'discipline', say analysts","The loan-to-value limit for HDB loans has been lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent, while property loans from private financial institutions will see an increase in medium-term interest rate floor by 0.5 per cent.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-cooling-measures-loans-ltv-limit-analysis-borrowing-2976151,"SINGAPORE: Tightened housing loan limits will help homeowners exercise prudence in their purchases amid rising interest rates and cost of living, said analysts on Friday (Sep 30). 
The adjustments are part of a latest slew of property cooling measures unveiled by Singapore Government on Thursday and kicking in the next day.
They include a 15-month wait-out period for private homeowners buying Housing Board resale flats, in order to moderate demand in the market. 
WHAT ARE THE CHANGES TO LOANS?
For HDB loans, the loan-to-value (LTV) limit has been lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.
For property loans from private financial institutions, the medium-term interest rate floor - used to compute total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) and mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) - has been raised by 0.5 per cent.
Residential property purchase loans and mortgage equity withdrawal loans will now have a higher floor of 4 per cent per annum, or the thereafter interest rate. 
The thereafter interest rate refers to the highest possible interest rate applicable during the tenure of a property loan, excluding introductory or promotional rates.
TDSR, meanwhile, refers to the portion of a borrower’s gross monthly income that goes towards repaying monthly debt obligations - including the loan being applied for - while MSR is applicable to loans for HDB flats.
By raising the medium-term interest rate floor, authorities are tightening the criteria to assess a borrower's ability to repay the loan. 
This will apply to property loans where the option to purchase is granted on or after Sep 30.

Singapore introduces property cooling measures, with stricter borrowing criteria and tighter limits for HDB loans













WHY ARE THE CHANGES NECESSARY? 
That people are forking out ""eye-watering"" amounts for public housing was a key consideration in implementing the new measures, noted Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at real estate agency OrangeTee & Tie.
With more flats across the island fetching record prices and more transactions crossing S$800,000, some buyers may already be overstretching their finances, she added. 
""The adjustment of the MSR will have an impact on buyers' housing affordability. With more stringent TDSR and MSR, buyers will have to pay more cash as they can only take fewer loans,"" said Ms Sun.
""This will have a knock-on effect on moderating housing demand and the pace of price growth.""
Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst of research and content creation at One Global Group, said the stricter loan limits represent a ""proactive"" approach to ensure the impact of borrowing costs for home purchases are taken into consideration for the long-term.
It also takes into account further increases in interest rates, influenced by global market movements, he said.
""The further tightening of the loan quantum limits for HDB housing loans will encourage greater financial prudence among buyers,"" said Mr Sandrasegeran. 
""It is crucial to maintain a check and balance through these measures in order to reduce excessive price increases and 'overheating' in the public housing market.""
Catherine He, director and head of research for Singapore at Colliers, said that amid the ""double whammy"" of a steep rise in interest rates and higher cost of living, the new measures are ""timely and well-calibrated"" and will ""instil discipline and prevent buyers from overleveraging"".
She believes the adjustments to loan limits also protects a public who might be unaware that an impending era of higher interest rates will be ""very different"" from the long period of low interest rates enjoyed from 2013 to 2021. 
This will have a ""sizeable"" impact on their finances should they overextend on housing loans, Ms He warned.
""This adjustment is also necessary, as with three-month SORA (Singapore Overnight Rate Average) nearing 2 per cent and mortgage rates around 3 per cent, it is likely the previous floor of 3.5 per cent for residential and 4.5 per cent for non-residential properties will soon be breached,"" she added. 
HOW ARE PRIVATE PROPERTY BUYERS AFFECTED?
On how the revised loan limits will affect the private residential market, CBRE's head of research for Southeast Asia Tricia Song, noted that the increase in interest rate floor for TDSR was ""widely expected and not a surprise"". 
""Interest rates have been rising and most fixed-rate mortgage packages have exceeded 3 per cent,"" she explained.
""Based on our calculations, assuming a 20- and 30-year loan term, a 0.5 percentage point increase of interest rate floor for TDSR will reduce the maximum allowable loan and property price by 4.3 and 5.9 per cent respectively, regardless of LTV levels and income.""
Analysts also illustrated how the loans would affect different individuals depending on their income. 
For the private property market where S$2 million home price quantums are ""increasingly common"", affordability will ""undoubtedly"" be impacted - even in the suburban segment, said Lam Chern Woon, head of research and consulting at Edmund Tie.
Mr Lam outlined how a S$1.5 million loan with a 30-year tenure would now require a higher monthly income of about S$13,000 compared to S$12,200 previously. This assumes the individual has no other debt obligations.
""Meanwhile, a household with a monthly income of about S$12,200 would now only be eligible for up to S$1.41 million loan to support a S$1.88 million property purchase, compared to S$2 million previously,"" he added. 
With the TDSR calculation now using a 4 per cent interest rate, the maximum loan for borrowers with a S$10,000 household income on a 30-year loan tenure will be reduced from S$1.23 million to S$1.15 million, added OrangeTee & Tie's Ms Sun.
""Therefore, a buyer can only purchase a property up to a value of S$1.53 million instead of S$1.63 million, without an additional cash outlay."" 
Colliers' Ms He expects many buyers to be priced out of the market by the rise of the medium-term interest floor rate by 0.5 per cent, as wages are ""sticky and unlikely to be adjusted quickly"" despite the rising cost of living. 
""For example, assuming there are no other loan obligations, (an increase in) monthly income of up to S$1,032 is needed if a buyer wants to take up a S$2 million loan for a residential property after the adjustment. Or the loan amount will have to be reduced,"" she said.

IMPACT ON PROPERTY MARKET
The new cooling measures will have ""minimal impact"" on private residential sales in the immediate term, since there is no adjustment to the LTV for bank loans, said Dr Tan Tee Khoon, country manager for PropertyGuru Singapore. 
""Furthermore, lenders have already been exercising prudence in offering loans and have taken into account higher interest rates in repayments,"" he added. 
""However, there may be some knee-jerk reaction by buyers to recalibrate their purchase options.
""We anticipate that prospective buyers will likely take longer to commit to home purchases, translating to a slowdown in sales as the negotiation of prices and matching of buyers takes longer."" 
As for the impact of the cooling measures in the middle to long term, they are ""likely to be dwarfed by future volatile global economic conditions"", said Dr Tan.
""Higher interest rate hikes and recessionary pressure will lead to more caution in discretionary spending and purchasing of homes,"" he said.
""Separately, the measures may inject confidence among foreign buyers with strong wealth preservation motives that the Singapore residential market will be on a sustainable path of growth.""
Ultimately, it is important to remember the cooling measures are intended to ""introduce prudence to every segment of the market"", especially since Singapore's interest rates are pegged to the United States' Federal Reserve rates, said Edmund Tie CEO Desmond Sim. 
The latest hike of 0.75 per cent for the US central bank's rates, in order to tame inflation, has ""significantly"" impacted mortgage interest rates in Singapore, he noted.
""In layman's terms, it's like previously, you needed to be 1.3m to sit a rollercoaster. So now, they just changed it to 1.35m,"" said Mr Sim.
""Because of (the hike in US Fed rates), it means the rollercoaster ride has gotten more dangerous. So we need to basically have a higher height limit to make sure that safety is ensured.
""In the spirit of F1 happening this weekend - this would be like if the safety car is deployed."""
"Tighter home loan limits, new rules to cool HDB resale market: What you need to know ","What are the property cooling measures that took effect on Sep 30 and how will they affect your ability to take up home loans? What happens if you are selling your private property to buy an HDB resale flat?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-property-cooling-measures-what-you-need-know-2975836,"SINGAPORE: New property cooling measures took effect on Friday (Sep 30), with tighter lending limits for housing loans that are aimed at ensuring prudent borrowing amid rising interest rates.
To moderate demand in the public housing market, authorities have also introduced a 15-month wait-out period for private home owners before they can purchase a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.
Here's a breakdown of what the measures are and how they may impact property owners.
STRICTER CRITERIA FOR BORROWING
The medium-term interest rate floor for property loans from banks will be raised by 0.5 percentage points - from 3.5 per cent per annum to 4 per cent for residential home loans.
Simply put, the figures are used to assess a borrower's ability to repay loans, such that it meets requirements under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) and mortgage servicing ratio (MSR).
TDSR limits the amount borrowers can spend on repaying their monthly debt obligations - including housing loans and car loans - to 55 per cent of their gross monthly income.
So if the medium-term interest rate - described as a stress test rate - goes up, home loan applicants must still be able to maintain a TDSR of 55 per cent, even if this stress test rate increases to 4 per cent. 
This is a common method financial institutions use to determine if a borrower can still manage repayments in the event of actual interest spikes.
As an example, if a buyer wants to take up a S$1 million home loan after the stress test rate adjustment to 4 per cent, he would either have to have a higher monthly income to meet the TDSR, or the loan amount will have to be reduced. (Assuming no other debt obligations.)





 Type of Loan
 Medium-term interest rate
Residential property purchase loans and 
			 mortgage equity withdrawal loans
The higher of a 4 per cent per annum floor (up from 3.5 per cent per annum) or the thereafter interest rate*
			*The thereafter interest rate is the highest possible interest rate applicable during the tenure of a property loan, excluding introductory or promotional rates.
 Non-residential property purchase loans 
			 and mortgage equity withdrawal loans
The higher of a 5 per cent per annum floor (up from 4.5 per cent per annum) or the thereafter interest rate






MSR, meanwhile, applies only to loans for HDB flats and executive condominiums (ECs). It limits monthly repayments to 30 per cent of a borrower's gross monthly income.
Both TDSR and MSR work together to prevent borrowers from falling into debt from loans they cannot handle, and also to regulate lending amounts by financial institutions.
They also stop borrowers from committing a higher proportion of household income to repay a loan faster.
However, the actual interest rates charged for mortgages will continue to be determined by private financial institutions.
WHO DOES IT AFFECT?
This will apply to property loans where the option to purchase (OTP) is granted on or after Sep 30. If there is no OTP, it will apply when the date of sale and purchase agreement is on or after that date.
This also applies to fresh applications for an HDB loan eligibility letter received on or after midnight on Sep 30.

Tightened property loan criteria 'timely, well-calibrated'; will instil buyer 'discipline', say analysts













NEW HDB LOAN INTEREST RATE FLOOR
A new interest rate floor of 3 per cent has also been introduced for computing HDB’s concessionary housing loan amount. This works in tandem with the TDSR and MSR framework.
This means a borrower’s eligible housing loan amount will be computed using 3 per cent per annum or 0.1 percentage point above the prevailing CPF Ordinary Account interest rate, whichever is higher.
An interest rate floor is the lowest possible determined interest rate in a loan, which may otherwise fluctuate during the repayment period.
The revised interest rate floor will not affect the actual HDB concessionary interest rate, which remains at 2.6 per cent per annum, and will not impact existing applications received by HDB before this time.
According to HDB, its use of the interest rate floor to compute the housing loan amount ""encourages flat buyers to borrow prudently as purchasing a flat is a long-term financial commitment"".

LOWERING LTV
The loan-to-value (LTV) limit for HDB loans has been lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent. This is the amount you are allowed to borrow to finance your HDB flat.
With the new 80 per cent loan-to-value limit, it means potential home owners will have to fork out 20 per cent in cash down payments upfront or through CPF.
WHO DOES IT AFFECT?
The revised LTV limit will apply to new flat applications for sales exercises launched and complete resale applications which are received by HDB on or after Sep 30.
The revised LTV limit does not apply to loans granted by private financial institutions, which will remain at 75 per cent.
15-MONTH WAIT-OUT PERIOD
When private home owners sell their property, they will now have to wait for 15 months before they can purchase a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.
This will also apply to those who sold their private property prior to submitting an application to buy a resale flat.
Previously, such property owners were allowed to buy an HDB resale flat on the open market if they sold their private properties within six months of purchasing the HDB unit.
Seniors aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat are unaffected by the new rules.
The wait-out period for private home owners buying their first HDB flat who wish to apply for the CPF Housing Grant and Enhanced CPF Housing Grant for their resale unit also remains unchanged at 30 months.

WHY ARE AUTHORITIES DOING THIS?
Market interest rates have ""risen significantly"" and are likely to increase further, noted the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of National Development and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in a joint media release.
This will affect borrowing costs for home purchases.
The tightened loan limits are to ""ensure prudent borrowing and avoid future difficulties in servicing home loans"", authorities said.
The longer wait-out period is aimed at moderating demand and ensuring that resale flats remain affordable - a temporary measure which will be reviewed in future ""depending on overall market conditions and housing demand"".
Authorities cited a ""clear upward momentum"" in HDB resale prices, with an increase of more than 5 per cent in the HDB Resale Price Index as of the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Five on Friday: 5 unusual ways to work up a sweat,"In CNA's regular look at what hit the headlines during the week, Five on Friday looks at some unique workouts that will get your heartrate up. Who says exercising is boring?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/5-unusual-workouts-indoor-bungee-puppy-yoga-climbing-aquaspin-2973981,"SINGAPORE: It’s been a bumpy road to recovery for the fitness industry in Singapore. 
While unhealthy routines and revenge travel have kept many away from studios and gyms, businesses have also had to grapple with more competition as new contenders enter the market. 
Many are also clocking fewer steps as they work from home. 
Regardless of what your daily schedule looks like these days, prevailing wisdom and common sense says some exercise is better than nothing – for both your physical and mental health. 
If you are in need of exercise inspiration, consider these new or unusual ways to break a sweat:
INDOOR “BUNGEE”
No daredevils needed but there are some gravity-defying stunts being done indoors.
Think Matrix, but that someone forgot to digitally remove the cord.
Participants are strapped into a harness connected to an elastic bungee cord. After that, bounce and soar your way to a fitter body. 
Movement & Sports Medicine Centre in Singapore claims that bungee fitness classes burn more calories compared to normal exercises while also being kinder on the joints. 
The bungee helps to simulate the buoyancy one feels in the swimming pool, the centre said, adding that its bungee can take up to 200kg. 
Elin Dance Studio along Dunearn Road also offers such classes. The “fitness” option, which is described as stress-relieving, incorporates movements like jumps and dives.
For those who just want to have fun, there's a “family” option where parents and children can exercise together, as well as a rhythmic “bungee dance” class that is for more experienced participants.

BIKE IN THE WATER
Those who can’t decide between cycling or soaking in the pool can have the best of both worlds with Aquaspin. 
The premise is simple, you pedal a stationary bike in a swimming pool with the water acting as a resistance.
The Ripple Club, which conducts various classes at locations such as Fairmont Singapore and Oasia Downtown, describes water as the “perfect training ground” as it prevents injury, protects joints and provides natural resistance for strength and endurance training. 
Pregnant or postpartum women, those with injuries, as well as athletes are welcome to join their classes, said the club on its website, which lists workouts of various intensities as well as a virtual option.

GAME FIT
It’s a circuit workout but with a techie twist.
Exergame 4D is a programme that hails from South Korea and those interested to try can sign up for it at Ascend Fitness at the YMCA Building.
The activity, which takes place in a darkened room with interactive light projections, meshes a research-based workout curriculum with a “gamification” strategy that keeps classes engaging and competitive, said Ascend Fitness on its website. 
Still confused? 
Those of us who are old enough to remember Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade may find the scenario familiar.
A dim space with flashing lights, sensors and sound – and the urgency to keep up with the instructions as they cascade across the screen. 
Follow the lighted panels and step or move into the space. As the workout progresses, the changing lights become faster until everything becomes a blur. 
Your score is also put up at the end of the session, (hopefully) reflecting how well you have done as well as the calories that you have burnt. 
Could this ""gamification"" way of working out be the future?
















SEE YOU AT THE TOP
Take a break from scaling the corporate ladder and let go of some steam through climbing of a different kind.
Those with a fear of heights, fret not. Versa climbing, or vertical climbing, is done on a machine. 
CLMB Studio along Shenton Way claims that participants can burn up to 800 calories after a 45 minute workout on the climber. Some classes focus only on climbing while others throw in high intensity interval training and weights.
You can expect club-like lights and tunes while you test your cardiovascular endurance. CLMB Studio also said on its website that “no two workouts are the same” so you can expect to be kept on your toes.

PUPPY LOVE
A whole new meaning to downward dog.
Forward fold and plank your way to better health and fitness as dogs wander the room, looking for a quick play or cuddle.
Classes at Puppy Yoga Singapore are split into 35 minutes of yoga and 15 minutes of “pure playtime” with the dogs. The website lists classes with “small and medium” as well as “medium and big” dogs. 
Some of my colleagues raised their eyebrows when I mentioned this class. 
""Are cats welcomed?"" ""Why would I want to bring my dog to a yoga class?""
According to the organisers, the classes not only allow you to bond with your dog, it also allows them to ""socialise with other dogs and humans in a safe, calm environment"".
While it is not compulsory for you to bring along a canine, though those who attend with their furkids enjoy a small discount as doggos are an “integral part of the experience”.
Do note that your pets must be non-aggressive, potty trained, vaccinated, clean and healthy.

Restaurant chain TungLok Group, which usually runs food kiosks for ticket holders and caters meals to the Singapore GP’s army of workers, faced speed bumps from the planning stage.
With less skilled manpower available, it is deploying only 20 per cent of its usual number of skilled chefs for the event this year, and has scaled down operations and overhauled its processes as a result.
It decided to drop the kiosks and focus on serving up 15,000 hot bento meals to the thousands of people working behind-the-scenes.
To make up for the fewer chefs on-site, the firm’s catering arm BellyGood will employ the cook-chill process using technology, in which food is fully cooked before being rapidly chilled and stored. The ready-made food can then be reheated right before being served.
















The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have plagued industries with a shortage of workers and caused disruptions to the supply chain.
“COVID-19 has shaped us into something a little bit different today, and we’ve learnt to be smarter,” said Mr Nixon Low, senior executive chef of TungLok Group.
“Less skilled labour means we have to reorganise – we do more preparations and easier executions.”
FINDING SOLUTIONS
Another challenge was the uncertainty surrounding the logistics in the months leading up to the F1 weekend, as evolving COVID-19 restrictions made it difficult to ascertain the number of diners and the amount of food the caterer had to prepare, said Mr Low.
“That’s why our strategy this year gives us room for manoeuvre. So even if there’s a decrease (in diners), we have proper storage and will not have food wastage,” he added. “So I think this tactic of doing a cook-chill for this year’s event is perfect, it makes sense.”

Other restaurants also managed to find workarounds for their constraints.
Picotin restaurant at The Fullerton Waterboat House, which is right in the middle of the F1 action, said it has managed its staff shortages by shifting employees from its two other outlets to focus efforts in its prime location.
Outside the F1 arena, restaurant LeVeL33, a popular spot due to its aerial view of part of the F1 circuit, said that while it is experiencing a manpower crunch of about 15 per cent, it has engaged part-timers to manage the workload.
The restaurant said this weekend will see its return to pre-pandemic closing hours of 2am as it is expecting high demand for night dining after each race.
SHORTER LEAD TIME
The return of the Singapore GP was announced in January, giving organisers and vendors a shorter lead time than previous years for preparations.
This year’s event is anticipating its biggest spectator turnout since the first night race in 2008, and organisers said that despite having less time to plan, experience will see them through to the finish line. 
Event organiser Singapore Grand Prix said it tapped on experienced contractors who they have worked extensively with in the past, and who already have blueprints in place for execution. 
With the easing of restrictions, the event was also able to secure regional vendors and workers to fill the manpower gap.

“This year, we expect a much larger crowd than before, but with the depth of expertise that we have built over 10 to 15 years, and with the people we have groomed, we are more than capable of handling this weekend’s event,” said Mr Christopher Choo, assistant director of the Singapore Grand Prix.
“We tapped on contractors and vendors who have had experience in the event, so there's no big need to re-plan and re-think everything. They could come in and work with us on plans that we've done previously, in previous years.”
One example of such experienced contractors is Pico, which found ways around its challenges.
Having put together the F1 grandstand and corporate suites since the inaugural Singapore GP, the firm said that despite supply chain disruptions, it pulled off its job this year by using recycled material and relying on the expertise of its core team in charge of previous races.
“The material used in the events are mostly recycled for every year. This became a foresight for this year, when the global supply chain was disrupted as a result of the pandemic. This allows all work to remain on track,” said Mr Jayden Huang Renjie, Pico’s general manager.
Tourists aside, Singaporeans are expected to spend a whopping S$420 million visiting bars, restaurants, and cafes during the Grand Prix, according to guest experience and retention platform SevenRooms.

Man jailed for taking upskirt video of woman at supermarket by placing phone in basket,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-upskirt-video-woman-supermarket-phone-basket-abe-hidenori-2976516,"SINGAPORE: A 41-year-old man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Friday (Sep 30) for taking an upskirt video of a woman who was shopping for groceries in a supermarket.
Abe Hidenori pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism.
The court heard that the victim went to The Clementi Mall on Feb 25 this year and was shopping for groceries when she felt something touch her while she was at the frozen foods aisle.
She turned and saw Abe walking away, carrying a shopping basket. She noticed a phone in the corner of the basket and suspected that he had taken an upskirt video of her.
The woman told her husband what happened, and he called the police. Abe was identified and admitted to the police that he had spotted the victim, who was wearing a skirt.
He decided to record a video under her skirt and placed his phone in his shopping basket, with the camera facing upwards.
Abe admitted that this was not the first time he had taken an upskirt video. He had done so before as he was stressed at work.
The prosecutor asked for six weeks' jail, noting that Abe had no previous convictions. He highlighted the public location of the offence as well as the fact that this was not his first time taking an upskirt video.
Abe's lawyer, from law firm Rajah & Tann, asked instead for five weeks' jail.
The judge said Abe had admitted to using the same method to record upskirt videos in supermarkets before. Referring to Abe's written mitigation plea, he said financial circumstances cannot be relied on as a mitigating factor.
The prosecutor asked for Abe's phone to be confiscated, but his lawyer asked if Abe could first be allowed to retrieve his phone contacts, family photos and messaging data that were in his device.
She said he needed the information to contact people in Japan when he returns to the country, and he had not seen his family photos since May.
The judge granted the request.
For voyeurism, Abe could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments."
Singapore Airlines pilot charged with under-declaring personal income tax for 6 years,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-airlines-pilot-charged-under-declare-personal-income-tax-2976361,"SINGAPORE: A pilot with the Singapore Airlines was charged in court on Friday (Sep 30) with various tax offences, including under-declaring his personal income tax over six years and submitting false documents when asked for details of his rental properties.
As a result of his alleged offences of under-declaring his personal income tax between 2014 and 2019, more than S$59,000 in taxes were undercharged, court documents show.
Singaporean Andrew Soo Cheng Ai, 50, was handed 13 charges in all. His lawyer successfully applied for him to leave the country for work, as he has to fly to various countries for the national carrier.
According to charge sheets, Soo's first alleged offence occurred in August 2013, when he failed to notify the Comptroller of Income Tax about an omission of income of S$56,866 in his notice of assessment for the year of assessment 2013.
This led to tax undercharged of S$9,188.02. In the six years that followed, Soo allegedly under-declared his personal income tax. In 2014, he stated his chargeable income as about S$146,900 when it was about S$236,600, leading to tax undercharged of about S$15,400.
The year after this, he stated his chargeable income was about S$13,700 when it was about S$91,900, leading to tax undercharged of about S$3,700, according to charge sheets. This continued every year up to 2019, when he allegedly stated his chargeable income was about S$173,200 instead of about S$226,900. This led to tax undercharged of about S$9,900.
On top of this, Soo allegedly submitted multiple fictitious invoices and documents with the intention to evade tax in June 2018, in relation to his rental properties in Balestier Road and Kim Yam Road.
When asked for details of his rental properties, Soo purportedly gave a false answer in an email reply. If the reply had been accepted as correct, there would have been an understatement of income of S$229,307 in Soo's revised notices of assessments for the years of assessments 2013 to 2018, leading to tax undercharged of about S$35,300.
On Friday, Soo's lawyer said his client had unique circumstances as he is a pilot and needs his passport for work.
He said investigations against Soo began in 2017 and Soo has been cooperative since. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore raided his premises in 2019, ""so he could have run away during that time if he wanted to, but he didn't"", said the lawyer.
The prosecutor confirmed that Soo was cooperative during investigations and provided his itinerary when asked for it. The investigation officer has also always been able to contact him, she said.
However, the prosecutor said these were fairly serious offences, adding that Soo owns three properties in Singapore but his parents and brother reside overseas. Soo also has multiple properties overseas, contributing to his flight risk, she said.
She asked for his bail amount to be doubled from S$80,000 to S$160,000 if he were allowed to leave Singapore for work.
The judge granted Soo's request to leave jurisdiction, but only for work. If he were to travel for leisure, he will have to reapply for leave to do so. She ordered that he provide an additional S$60,000 bail to leave the jurisdiction and asked the defence to liaise with the investigation officer over the issue of keeping his passport.
A colleague stood bail for Soo. He is set to return to court in November."
"About 950,000 HDB households to get third tranche of GST vouchers in October",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-households-gst-voucher-scc-october-2022-rebates-mof-2976296,"SINGAPORE: About 950,000 Singaporean households living in Housing Board (HDB) flats will receive their third quarterly Goods and Services Tax Voucher (GSTV) - U-Save and GSTV - service and conservancy charges (S&CC) rebates in October. 
The rebates are part of the permanent GSTV scheme and Household Support Package (HSP) announced during the 2022 Budget in February, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Friday (Sep 30). 
They will provide ""continuing help"" to defray GST and other living expenses of lower- to middle-income Singaporean households, the ministry added. 
Singapore is facing a rising cost of living amid higher global energy and food prices as well as supply chain disruptions.
The authorities have said that an upcoming increase to the GST will not be delayed despite rising inflation, and have announced several support measures to help Singaporeans with rising costs.
Under the enhanced GSTV scheme, eligible households will receive GSTV – S&CC rebates to offset between 1.5 and 3.5 months of their S&CC each year. The rebates are disbursed in April, July, October and January.
Eligible households will receive double their regular U-Save in FY2022.
This amounts to about eight to 10 months' worth of utility bills for the average household living in 1- and 2-room HDB flats, said the Finance Ministry.
For the average household living in 3- and 4-room HDB flats, this amounts to about four to six months' worth of utility bills. 






      Table showing GSTV - U-Save rebate to be received for each HDB flat type for FY2022. (Image: Ministry of Finance)
    






Households whose members own more than one property are not eligible for GSTV – U-Save, said MOF.
Additional rebates will be credited to the eligible households at the same time as their regular GSTV – U-Save in the usual four quarters. 
The Assurance Package U-Save will be provided quarterly starting from January 2023 and ending in January 2026, said the Finance Ministry. 
In addition to the GSTV – U-Save and S&CC rebates for eligible households, each Singaporean household was also given a one-off S$100 Household Utilities Credit as part of the S$1.5 billion package announced in June to help Singaporeans cope with higher inflation.
Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said at a press conference in June that the support measures in the package are ""tilted"" towards helping lower-income and vulnerable groups as they would be disproportionately impacted by the effects of inflation. 
GSTV - S&CC rebates will be credited directly into households’ S&CC accounts managed by their respective Town Councils. Households do not need to take any action to benefit from the rebates.
Households whose members own more than one property are not eligible for GSTV - U-Save, said MOF. 
Residents can check or enquire on their eligibility for the GSTV – S&CC Rebate by logging into My HDBPage with their Singpass. Those with specific queries on their household’s S&CC payment or account status can contact their respective Town Councils.
For queries on the GSTV - U-Save, residents can contact SP Group at 6671 7177 or send an email to customer support.

15-month wait for private home owners to buy resale HDB 'a form of deterrence for buyers with deep pockets': Analysts,"The 15-month wait-out period may also affect the HDB resale market, particularly the bigger five-room and executive flats, say property analysts. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-cooling-15-month-wait-private-homeowners-buy-resale-hdb-analysts-2975946,"SINGAPORE: Some private property owners might now find themselves in a pickle, having to wait for 15 months before they can purchase a non-subsidised Housing Board flat, said property analysts after the new rule was announced on Thursday (Sep 29). 
This wait-out period will kick in after they have sold their private property, according to a joint press release by the Housing Development Board (HDB), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of National Development (MND). 
Previously, these private property owners were allowed to buy a Housing Board resale flat on the open market, as long as they sell their private properties within six months of the purchase. 
This new rule will also apply to those who have already sold their private property prior to submitting an application to buy a resale flat.
However, it will not apply to seniors aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat. 
Other announcements in the latest slew of property cooling measures include tightening maximum loan quantum limits and lowering the loan-to-value (LTV) limit for HDB loans from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.

Tighter home loan limits, new rules to cool HDB resale market: What you need to know 



















Tightened property loan criteria 'timely, well-calibrated'; will instil buyer 'discipline', say analysts













REASON FOR PAUSE
The 15-month wait-out period is a ""surprising turn of events"", but will likely serve as ""a form of deterrence for buyers with deep pockets"", according to Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst of research and content creation at One Global Group. 
The ruling comes after more million-dollar flats, including in Woodlands, made headlines in recent months. 
""Probably the biggest implication is that many homeowners hoping for a quick profit and enticed by HDB’s fixed interest rate to right-size or downsize to a HDB resale flat will likely be more hesitant now,"" explained Mr Sandrasegeran. 
""Private property owners who are hoping to sell their private home and buy a HDB resale unit have to be prepared for a lengthy wait. It is definitely something worth considering before pulling the trigger on these purchases.
This ruling will likely ""curb demand for private property owners who are looking for larger spaces in the HDB resale market"", and possibly ""taper demand for high-value transactions and deter buyers from going 'all out' for a bigger space in the HDB resale market"", said Mr Sandrasegeran. 
""For instance, executive flats and loft units are a form of premium units that garner heavy interest. The buyers of these flats are often unaffected by the excessive pricing and have ample liquidity. But with the 15-month wait-out term for private property owners, their hands are forced, and they may likely think twice about buying such a flat."" 
Mr Sandrasegeran added that the ruling could also result in a ""holdback"" in some private property owners putting up their units for sale, as well as a potential ""drop in volume in the condominium resale market"". 
Similarly, Tricia Song, head of research for Southeast Asia at CBRE, said the latest cooling measures, including the 15-month wait-out period, might result in a ""more severe impact"" on the HDB resale market, particularly the bigger five-room and executive HDB flats. 
These flats could see ""lower demand from private home downgraders or en bloc sellers, and in turn prices would also be moderated"", she said. 
""However, lower HDB resale prices in turn could also moderate upgraders’ ability and thus demand into private homes. ... Some HDB sellers who had decoupled from selling their HDB flats at high prices and used these proceeds to buy investment private property would also be impacted,"" she added.

MAKING IT EASIER FOR FIRST-TIMERS, YOUNG COUPLES
But the 15-month wait-out period is likely to be the most significant measure introduced, as this will ""tame demand and prices for the upper tier of the HDB resale market"" and make it easier for first-timers to purchase homes, said Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie. 
Ms Sun pointed to HDB data which showed that prices of larger resale flats like five-room flats and executive flats have been ""rising much faster"" than smaller flats over the past year. 
For instance, about one to two flats have been sold for a million-dollars every other day over the past month, she said. 
""Demand for these larger flats and million-dollar flats could be largely bought by private homeowners or downgraders who can afford to pay high prices for these flats, thus driving up their prices which will affect the overall price index for all resale flats,"" she explained. 
As such, ""this (15-month wait-out period) may cool the market for a while and slow down the pace of price increase for these bigger flats to a certain extent and allow younger couples a better chance of securing these units with lesser competition,"" she added.
""Overall price growth may moderate which will also help first-timers to have a better chance of buying resale flats if they cannot wait for the long completion period for some BTO flats."" 
Despite the intention to keep resale flats affordable, Mr Sandrasegeran noted that ""genuine"" downgraders from private properties might face a dilemma. 
""Some homeowners might be in need of immediate finances because of a family emergency, a change in their job status, or other reasons like a change in their personal financial conditions,"" he said.
""It was mentioned that the authorities would assess their situation on a case-by-case basis. It would be ideal if special circumstances like these are given proper considerations.""

Shares of Singapore property developers fall after new cooling measures













RENTAL MARKET IMPACTED
Analysts also noted the 15-month wait-out period's result on the rental market. 
Private property owners who still wish to purchase a unit may ""need to rent a unit in the interim"", which may increase rental demand and push current rental prices even higher, said Ms Sun. 
CBRE's Ms Song added that the 15-month wait-out period might actually ""help support the rental market for both private and public housing market"", especially as more completions are slated for next year. 
""As of Q2 2022, 17,394 private homes are due to be completed in 2023, the highest number of completions in a single year since 2016. Residential rents are at a record high now and with this announcement, (rent) may continue to move up and remain elevated into 2023,"" she said."
Shares of Singapore property developers fall after new cooling measures,"Developers may push back some launches, says a property analyst after authorities announced stricter borrowing criteria for home loans. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-property-stocks-cooling-measures-developers-loan-limits-hdb-2976186,"SINGAPORE: Shares of Singapore property developers pared some losses on Friday (Sep 30) after taking a hit in the morning, following the late-night announcement of cooling measures.
The measures include raising the medium-term interest rate floor by 0.5 percentage points to 4 per cent. The so-called “stress test” rate is used by banks to compute a borrower’s loan eligibility amount to fulfil the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limit of 55 per cent. 
TDSR refers to the portion of a borrower’s gross monthly income that goes towards repaying their monthly debt obligations.
The new medium-term interest rate floor means authorities are tightening the criteria to assess a borrower's ability to repay the loan. 
Shares of City Developments Limited (CDL) ended down 0.1 per cent after falling by as much as 2.5 per cent on Friday morning.
As of the midday trading break, Wing Tai Holdings slid 3.3 per cent but ended the trading day 0.7 per cent lower. 
Frasers Property fell 1 per cent, while OUE lost 2.3 per cent.
Real estate agency PropNex extended earlier losses, falling 2.6 per cent. 
Shares of local banks, which have been revising their home loan packages amid rising interest rates, ended higher. DBS and OCBC edged up 1.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, while UOB closed 0.1 per cent higher.

Tightened property loan criteria 'timely, well-calibrated'; will instil buyer 'discipline', say analysts













In announcing the cooling measures, Singapore authorities noted that market interest rates have risen significantly and are likely to rise further, which will affect borrowing costs for home purchases.
""We urge households to exercise prudence before taking up any new loans and be sure of their debt-servicing ability before making long-term financial commitments,” said the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of National Development and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in a joint media release. 
Property analysts said the calibration of the medium-term stress test interest rate was widely expected.
“Mortgage rates have already exceeded 3 per cent in recent months and are likely to exceed the pre-measure stress test rate of 3.5 per cent going into 2023, vanquishing any meaningful buffer to safeguard borrowers’ ability to service property loans in a rising rate environment,” said Mr Lam Chern Woon, head of research and consulting at Edmund Tie. 
“For the private property market where S$2 million home price quantums are increasingly common, even in the suburban segment, affordability will undoubtedly be impacted.”
Huttons Asia’s senior director of research Lee Sze Teck said there may be some impact on demand as some buyers may hold back for the moment.
“Developers may defer some launches to next year,” he said. “Transaction volume may be slower in the next three months. We will probably see new sales transaction volume (at) around 8,000 units, lower than our initial forecast of up to 9,000 units in 2022.”
In the public housing market, the Government also lowered the loan-to-value (LTV) limit for HDB loans from 85 per cent to 80 per cent, reducing the maximum amount home buyers can borrow from HDB.
To moderate demand in the HDB resale market, the Government has imposed a 15-month wait-out period for private home owners before they can purchase a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.
This will kick in after they have sold their property.
Previously, such property owners were allowed to buy an HDB resale flat on the open market if they sold their private properties within six months of purchasing the HDB unit.
The 15-month wait-out period is a temporary measure and will not apply to seniors aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat.

Lower electricity tariffs from October to December after 6 consecutive hikes,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electricity-tariffs-sp-group-decrease-lower-energy-costs-2974136,"SINGAPORE: Electricity tariffs will be lower for the October to December period compared with the previous quarter, SP Group said on Friday (Sep 30) after six consecutive quarters of increase.
For the period from Oct 1 to Dec 31, the electricity tariff, excluding Goods and Services Tax (GST) will decrease by an average of 1.4 per cent or 0.42 cent per kWh compared with the previous quarter, said SP Group in a news release. 
""This is due to lower energy costs compared with the previous quarter.""
The electricity tariff for households will decrease from 30.17 to 29.74 cents per kWh, excluding GST, for the quarter ending Dec 31. The average monthly electricity bill for families living in HDB four-room flats will decrease by S$1.55, before GST, said the group. 
 











Last quarter, electricity tariffs went up by an average of 8.1 per cent, mainly due to higher energy costs driven by rising global gas and oil prices exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine.
SP Group reviews the electricity tariffs every quarter based on guidelines set by the Energy Market Authority (EMA). 
The electricity tariff consists of four components – energy costs paid to the generation companies, network costs and market support services fees paid to SP Group, as well as market administration and power system operation fees paid to the energy market company and power system operator. 
The energy costs component is adjusted quarterly to reflect the changes in the cost of fuel and power generation.
The fuel cost is the cost of imported natural gas, which is tied to oil prices by commercial contracts.
The cost of power generation covers mainly the costs of operating the power stations, such as the manpower and maintenance costs, as well as the capital cost of the stations.

Woman accused of killing husband in Ang Mo Kio found to be of unsound mind,"The High Court ordered that her case be reported to the Minister of Law after the woman was assessed to be unfit to plead.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-accused-kill-husband-ang-mo-kio-2019-unsound-mind-imh-2975971,"SINGAPORE: A woman accused of killing her husband in Ang Mo Kio in 2019 will have her case reported to the Minister of Law after she was assessed to be unfit to plead on the grounds of an unsound mind. 
Wang Shuzhen was arrested in 2019 after the authorities found the victim, 63-year-old Mr Teh Hock Pine, lying motionless at Block 633 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 on the morning of Oct 27 that year. 
The 57-year-old was originally charged with murder, but has since had her charge downgraded to culpable homicide not amounting to murder for allegedly using a glass ball - weighing about 2.6kg - to hit Mr Teh's head at least four times at about 5.45am.
In the High Court on Friday (Sep 30), the prosecution, referring to an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report, stated that Wang was not fit to plead in the circumstances that apply under the Criminal Procedure Code. 
Section 248 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that if the designated medical practitioner certifies that the accused is of unsound mind and incapable of making her defence, the court must stay proceedings. 
Justice Dedar Singh Gill noted the Sep 28 medical report, and a certification dated Sep 29, certified that Wang was of an unsound mind and incapable of making her defence. 
He directed that the case be reported to the Minister of Law, under section 249 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 
Section 249 states that if the offence is not bailable, the court must report the case to the Minister of Law. The Minister may order that the accused be confined in a psychiatric institution, or any other suitable place of safe custody and the court must give effect to that order.
Pending the Minister's order, Justice Gill ordered that Wang be detained at the Changi Prison Complex. 
During the hearing, Wang's lawyer under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS), Ms Sadhana Devi applied to discharge herself. 
The lawyer said she spoke to her client on Friday morning. 
""She reiterated that she wishes to discharge us as her counsel. This is in line with her delusional belief that my colleagues are involved in some way or the other with her husband so it would be very difficult for us to continue."" 
The lawyer added that should Wang's condition improve, she may apply for representation under CLAS again. 
Wang, who is a Chinese national, appeared in court via video link. According to previous psychiatric reports, Wang had been diagnosed with schizophrenia with psychotic symptoms. 
In response, Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia said that she would raise the matter of her representation at the pre-trial conference should the case be ""revived"". 
If convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Wang may be jailed for life or up to 20 years with a fine. She cannot be caned as she is a woman."
"Undertaker Roland Tay charged with evading S$427,000 in income tax, failing to register for GST",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/undertaker-roland-tay-charged-evading-s427000-income-tax-failing-register-gst-2973671,"SINGAPORE: Veteran undertaker Roland Tay Hai Choon was charged on Friday (Sep 30) with evading income tax of about S$427,000 and failing to register his businesses for Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Tay, the 75-year-old founder of Direct Funeral Services, was handed three charges under the Income Tax Act and one charge under the Goods and Services Tax Act.
He is accused of evading a total of S$427,427 in income taxes between April 2011 and April 2013 by falsely understating his total income for those years of assessment.
In April 2011, he allegedly made a false entry in his income tax return by stating that his total income was S$121,051, when it was in fact S$1,034,110.
In April 2012, he allegedly understated his total income to be S$138,976 when it was S$886,146.
Charge sheets state that he again repeated this by understating his total income as S$81,766 instead of S$682,513 in April 2013. 
Tay was also charged with failing to comply with the Goods and Services Tax Act in July 2010 by failing to notify the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax within a set period of his liability to be registered under the Act. This resulted in him owing S$286,962.97 of GST, which amounts to three years' worth of GST for the period between Oct 2010 and Sep 2013.
In a statement after the hearing, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) said investigations revealed that Tay's alleged failure to register for GST occurred when the total value of his taxable supplies exceeded S$1 million for four consecutive quarters.
""IRAS runs regular audit programmes across various industries to ensure tax compliance by individuals and businesses,"" said the authority. ""Using data analytics and advanced statistical tools, IRAS is able to verify tax reporting and detect anomalies. This case was uncovered through one such audit programme.""
Tay's lawyer asked for a slightly longer adjournment to take instructions from his client, as investigations commenced ""more than seven years ago and relate to matters from 2010 and 2012"".
Tay was offered bail of S$80,000 and his case will be heard again in November.
If convicted of making a false statement in a tax return, Tay could be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$10,000, or both. He will also be liable for a penalty three times the amount of tax that was undercharged.
For not registering his businesses for GST, he can be given a penalty equal to 10 per cent of the tax due. He can also be fined up to S$10,000 and be liable to a further penalty of S$50 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction.
Tay is a known figure in Singapore's funeral arrangements industry, known for providing funeral arrangements for victims in high-profile crime cases. These include murder victims Huang Na, a girl who was killed in 2004, and Madam Choong Pei Shan and her daughter in the 2017 Woodlands double murders."
Aspiring F1 drivers hope Singapore GP fever revs up local motorsport scene,"Motorsport enthusiasts in Singapore are hoping that the return of the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend will give a much-needed boost to the local scene.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/f1-singapore-grand-prix-aspiring-drivers-motorsport-2974446,"SINGAPORE: Teenager Kabir Anurag does not attend regular school like other youths his age. Instead, he spends his days racing in karting arenas at hair-raising speeds, chasing his dream of becoming a professional driver in Formula One.
The 15-year-old full-time go-kart driver, who has been captivated by motorsports since he was four, recently dropped out of school to focus on his goal, and put racing as his top priority.  
""I put racing in front of everything in my life. I have to work hard in the gym. I have to work hard at the track. I've put in thousands of hours on the track to become better,” said Kabir, whose supportive parents have engaged private tutors to help him keep up with his studies.
His sacrifices have yielded results – Kabir is currently in Italy for a world championship race, representing international karting team Ricky Flynn Motorsport.
Both Kabir and his coach Pavan Ravishankar – a former race car driver who wants to groom the next generation of pro-drivers the likes of Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton – hope that the return of the Singapore F1 Grand Prix this weekend will give a much-needed boost to the local scene, which has churned out a number of drivers but with little attention or support.
















BUMPY ROUTE TO RACE DAY FOR LOCAL DRIVERS
Time and money are the toughest roadblocks for aspiring F1 drivers in Singapore, as they have to go overseas to train and compete, said Mr Ravishankar. This means young drivers would have to make a choice between the sport and school.
Singaporean professional Formula 4 driver Christian Ho, 16, made that choice four years ago when he left Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) right before his Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) to pursue a career in karting in Italy.
Christian said it was a tough choice to make as he had to leave school and friends behind, and adapt to a new country where the competition was stronger, and where he had to use Google translate to get around.
“My parents sacrificed a lot – mom had to follow me, so she also had to leave friends behind,” he said, adding that he was working hard to power through the racing leagues to his ultimate goal – Formula 1.

Preparation work leading up to race day is also exhausting, involving cardio and strength exercises in the gym, practicing on racing simulators, building track knowledge, studying telemetry data from each drive, and reviewing team mates and competitors, said Mr Ravishankar.
LITTLE HELP AVAILABLE FOR ASPIRING DRIVERS
Singapore has a lot of “kids with big dreams” for motor racing, but the country does not have enough experts or coaches to help the aspiring drivers, said Mr Ravishankar, who co-founded the Integrate Motorsport Academy to fill the gap after hanging up his racing gloves.
“I think in Singapore there are a lot of kids craving the knowledge but I don't think that there are enough people providing that knowledge, and these kids don’t know where to start,” he said.
“There's a lot of opportunities in Singapore because we have a very difficult technical track. (Our drivers) can build a very strong base and then go around Asia and still be fast.”

While the Singapore GP could pique the interest of locals getting behind a steering wheel, the event does little to boost the profile of local drivers, said Christian, adding that he hopes Motor Sports Singapore (MSS), the sport’s governing body, does more to help home-grown drivers.
“I do hope to see more support from MSS. In order to boost motorsport in Singapore, they have to promote the drivers a bit more. Back the drivers a little bit in terms of financial support,” he said.
F1 FEVER ATTRACTS CROWDS TO GO-KART ARENAS
Motorsport enthusiasts and businesses are hoping that each year's Singapore GP will bring more locals to go-kart facilities, along with awareness of the sport and more opportunities to groom local talents like Kabir and Christian.
“F1 is quite important for us because it creates hype for our business and for potential drivers to come into this sport,” said Mr Paul Lee, director of operations at go-kart firm The Karting Arena.
The company’s Jurong circuit is designed for both fun and professional racing, with fun karts going up to 50kmh and race karts at double the speed.

Children from as young as four are allowed on the baby karts as long as they are of a certain height and are able to touch the pedals, said Mr Lee, adding that he hopes more fun kart drivers make the switch to race kart driving so that the motorsport scene in Singapore becomes more vibrant.
“You can still race at 65 years old. Karting is for all ages, not only for younger drivers,” said Mr Lee. “The thing about motorsports is: I think a lot of people think it’s inaccessible but actually it's quite accessible, and karting is the cheapest form of motorsports.”
Mr Lee said that the company is in the process of working with MSS to prepare its tracks for international races and hopes to soon start a race series so that the local scene attracts more international drivers.  
“The challenge is that we don't really have a very strong series racing in Singapore right now. If we do have then we can actually attract overseas drivers,” said Mr Lee. “We want to attract foreign drivers to come over so that our own drivers don't have to travel and can benefit from it.”
Mr Ravishankar said he hopes that the Singapore GP buzz will generate more interest in the local motorsport scene, and encourage people to try out the sport or even go professional.
“I hope that the Singapore GP will make people realise that motorsports exist. It will drive them down to the local kart tracks and get them interested in the sport. Then they would find people they trust to help them – coaches, teams – and eventually we'll just build on from there,” said Mr Ravishankar.
“And who knows, one day we might have an F1 driver in Singapore.”

"Airlines add flights, travel agency bookings spike as Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan ease border restrictions","The three destinations all relaxed COVID-19 measures in the past week, prompting increased demand for flights and tour packages.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/airlines-flights-travel-agencies-bookings-japan-hong-kong-taiwan-east-asia-2973956,"SINGAPORE: Airlines are adding more flights to Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan and travel agencies are receiving more bookings for holidays in these popular destinations, with revived tourist demand sparked by the easing of border restrictions.
From November, budget airline Scoot will fly to Osaka every day, up from five times a week now. 
It will also introduce seasonal non-stop flights between Singapore and Sapporo in Hokkaido from November to February 2023, a spokesperson told CNA. 
The frequency of Scoot's flights to Tokyo - via Taipei - will be increased to daily services from the end of October, and the airline will reinstate thrice weekly flights to Sapporo - also with a stopover in Taipei - from November. 
With these, Scoot will be operating a total of 18 flights to Taipei every week, said its spokesperson. 
Scoot expects travel demand to “remain buoyant” with the year-end holiday season approaching and countries further relaxing travel restrictions. 
“Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan are much loved destinations among our customers and we continue to see encouraging demand for flights to these countries,” said its spokesperson.

Commentary: Why are Singapore travellers so enamoured with Japan?













On Sep 22, Japan announced it would lift COVID-19 restrictions on foreign tourists from Oct 11, reopening its borders after two-and-a-half years. 
Taiwan said a week later that it would end mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for visitors from Oct 13.
Hong Kong has also moved to end mandatory hotel quarantine from Sep 26, ending tough travel curbs that lasted throughout the pandemic. 
All international arrivals will be able to return home or to accommodation of their choice, but will have to self-monitor for three days after entering the city. 
They will not be allowed to enter bars or restaurants during this period, under a system dubbed ""0+3"".
ADDING FLIGHTS AS ""QUICKLY"" AS POSSIBLE
At Cathay Pacific Airways, flight bookings from Singapore to Hong Kong increased “multiple times over” after the city's relaxation of quarantine requirements. 
The airline's regional general manager of Southeast Asia and Southwest Pacific Dominic Perret told CNA: “As more regional destinations continue to adjust their inbound travel policies, we will continue to monitor demand and adjust our passenger flight capacity accordingly.”
Cathay Pacific has added more than 200 pairs of passenger flights in October from Hong Kong, mostly to regional destinations like Osaka, Incheon Airport in South Korea, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Manila; as well as long-haul destinations like Vancouver, Sydney and Melbourne. 
With Japan’s relaxation of travel restrictions, Cathay Pacific will also resume daily flights to Tokyo from Nov 1, and flights to Sapporo four times a week from Dec 1, said Mr Perret. 
“We will also increase flight frequencies to Tokyo (Narita) to 43 pairs and Osaka to 50 pairs in October,” he added. 
Mr Perret said Cathay Pacific would continue to add back more flights ""as quickly as is feasible to strengthen the network connectivity of the Hong Kong aviation hub, including to Singapore”.
“We look forward to adding more flights to our Singapore schedule in the coming months so that more Hong Kong people can travel to the city-state and so that we can welcome more Singaporeans on board, whether they are travelling to Hong Kong or beyond.” 
Singapore Airlines (SIA) said they were unable to disclose specific figures due to ""commercial sensitivities”, but confirmed “strong"" demand for air travel across all markets. 
“This is for both leisure and business traffic and across all cabin classes … SIA will continue to closely monitor travel demand and adjust our capacity accordingly,” its spokesperson said.

NEW TOUR PACKAGES ON OFFER
Travel agencies have also recorded, across the board, spikes in sales of tour packages to Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
With demand for travel to these three locations expected to continue rising, the agencies have launched - or are planning to launch - new tour packages. 
Chan Brothers Travel has seen an increase in enquiries regarding all three destinations - in particular Japan, said senior marketing communications manager Jeremiah Wong. 
Japan is topping searches on its website, with a 30 per cent surge after the announcement of relaxed travel regulations. 
Chan Brothers will continue to expand its group tours to Japan to include destinations like the Mie and Niigata prefectures, said Mr Wong. 
This week, Chan Brothers also launched more free-and-easy travel packages to popular Japanese areas like Tokyo, Karuizawa, Kyoto and Osaka. 
“For Japan, we are already seeing great demand with over 100 group tours departing till this year end. With Chinese New Year and cherry blossom season coming up in 2023, we expect demand to continue to rise,” said Mr Wong. 
His agency is also looking to launch a six-day tour to Hong Kong catering to families during the school holidays. 
But Mr Wong noted that bookings to the region are currently limited to visiting friends and relatives or business travellers - as the continued requirement for multiple tests on arrival remains a ""dampener"" for tourists.
For Taiwan, Chan Brothers launched group tours at the end of July, in expectation of a reopening. They received “positive traction” and demand and bookings are surging now with the easing of restrictions, said Mr Wong. 
At CTC Travel agency, overall demand for tours to Japan, Hong Kong and China have increased by 100 per cent compared to a month ago.
“We have been working very closely with our counterparts, NTOs (national tourism organisations) and airlines for the latest updates for developing and launching new itineraries for our customers,” head of marketing Kelly Toh told CNA. 
Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan are top destinations among Singaporeans, especially during the year-end holidays, she added. 
“Although air-tickets may be limited especially for year-end holidays, we will be providing alternative options and working with various airlines,” said Ms Toh. 
MORE DEMAND TO COME
Growing demand for tour packages to Japan has been further driven by the low Japanese yen, said Hong Thai Travel's senior marketing manager Stella Chow.
The yen has depreciated nearly 20 per cent this year. On Sep 22, Japan intervened in the currency market for the first time since 1998 in a bid to shore up the battered yen, in the wake of the central bank's decision to maintain ultra-low interest rates that have been driving down the currency.
Booking platform Klook has registered a tenfold increase in searches for Japan since its reopening announcement, with travellers from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore driving this demand, it said in a press release on Wednesday (Sep 28).
Searches for Japan on the Expedia platform also surged immediately after the country's announcement, it said in a press release.
Searches from Hong Kong for hotels in Japan saw an 11-fold increase, while searches for flights grew by 12 times.
Searches for hotels and flights to Japan from Singapore and Taiwan also tripled, the booking platform said in a press release.
The Hong Thai agency has recorded a 30 per cent increase in enquiries about tour packages to Japan and a more than 50 per cent increase in enquiries about Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
It has “a few new tours” to Taiwan that are ready to be rolled out, but is waiting for more updates on entry regulations there, said Ms Chow. 
For Hong Kong, the agency is planning for tours to include surrounding islands like Cheung Chau and Tai O.
“However, the current regulations require PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or ART (antigen rapid test) testing and doesn’t allow for dine-in on first three nights upon arrival, which isn’t really suitable for leisure travellers,"" said Ms Chow.
""Demand will probably pick up when there is further easing of regulations.”

"Singapore introduces property cooling measures, with stricter borrowing criteria and tighter limits for HDB loans","Private home owners will now have to wait 15 months after they sell their property before they can buy an HDB resale flat. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-property-cooling-measures-loan-borrowing-criteria-hdb-ltv-limit-15-month-wait-out-period-2974776,"SINGAPORE: The Government unveiled a slew of property cooling measures on Thursday (Sep 29), aimed at moderating demand and ensuring prudent borrowing amid rising interest rates.
The measures, which come into effect from Sep 30, include tightening the maximum loan quantum limits. For HDB loans, the loan-to-value (LTV) limit has been lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.
To moderate demand in the HDB resale market, there is now a 15-month wait-out period for private home owners buying HDB resale flats.
""It is a temporary measure which will be reviewed in future depending on overall market conditions and housing demand,"" said HDB, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of National Development (MND) in a joint press release issued slightly after 11.40pm on Thursday.
LOAN LIMITS
Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said on Friday that Singapore enjoyed ""exceptionally low interest rates"" from 2013 to 2021, especially from private financial institutions, with introductory rates for new housing loans hovering around 2 per cent.
However, he added that there has been an increase in market interest rates over the last year.
""This will increase borrowing costs for those who are buying a home, and for those who are servicing existing home loans that are pegged to floating rates,"" he said.
The mortgage interest rates are expected to rise further in future, along with US interest rates, Mr Lee added.
To ensure prudent borrowing and avoid future difficulties in servicing home loans, the Government will tighten the maximum loan quantum limits for housing loans, the authorities said on Thursday.
For property loans from private financial institutions, the medium-term interest rate floor - which is used to compute the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) and the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) - has been raised by 0.5 percentage point.
TDSR refers to the portion of a borrower’s gross monthly income that goes towards repaying the monthly debt obligations - including the loan being applied for - while MSR is applicable to loans for HDB flats.
By raising the medium-term interest rate floor, authorities are tightening the criteria to assess a borrower's ability to repay the loan. 
This will apply to property loans where the option to purchase (OTP) is granted on or after Sep 30. If there is no option to purchase, it will apply when the date of sale and purchase agreement is on or after that date.
The actual interest rates charged for mortgages will continue to be determined by the private financial institutions.











For loans granted by HDB, the agency will introduce an interest rate floor of 3 per cent for computing the eligible loan amount.
This means the interest rate used to determine the eligible amount of HDB's concessionary housing loan will be 3 per cent per annum or 0.1 percentage point above the prevailing CPF Ordinary Account interest rate - whichever is higher.
The new interest rate floor will apply to fresh applications for an HDB loan eligibility letter received on or after midnight on Sep 30.
There will be no impact on existing applications received by HDB before this time. It will also not affect the actual HDB concessionary interest rate, which remains at 2.6 per cent per annum.

Shares of Singapore property developers fall after new cooling measures













LOAN-TO-VALUE LIMIT FOR HDB LOANS
Meanwhile, the loan-to-value (LTV) limit for HDB loans will be lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.
This reduces the maximum amount home buyers can borrow from HDB. But the revised limit will not apply to loans granted by financial institutions, which will remain at 75 per cent.
""The lower LTV limit will apply to new flat applications for sales exercises launched and complete resale applications which are received by HDB on or after Sep 30, 2022,"" authorities said.
They added that they do not expect this move to affect first-time and lower-income flat buyers significantly, as these potential home owners still receive housing grants of up to S$80,000 when buying a subsidised flat directly from HDB, or up to S$160,000 when buying a resale flat.
""They can also tap on their CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase, thereby reducing the loan amount they may need to take,"" authorities added.

NEW 15-MONTH WAIT-OUT PERIOD 
The latest round of measures comes about nine months after the previous package of measures introduced in December last year.
Since then, the HDB Resale Price Index has increased by more than 5 per cent as at the end of the second quarter of 2022, authorities noted.
Given the ""clear upward momentum in HDB resale prices"" and to moderate demand, the Government has imposed a 15-month wait-out period for private home owners before they can purchase a non-subsidised HDB resale flat.
This will kick in after they have sold their property.
The new rule will also apply to those who sold their private property prior to submitting an application to buy a resale flat.
Previously, such property owners were allowed to buy an HDB resale flat on the open market if they sold their private properties within six months of purchasing the HDB unit.
The new 15-month wait-out period will not apply to seniors aged 55 and above who are moving from their private property to a four-room or smaller resale flat, the authorities said.
The wait-out period for private home owners who are first-timers and wish to apply for the CPF Housing Grant and Enhanced CPF Housing Grant for their resale flat purchase also remains unchanged at 30 months.
The new 15-month wait-out period is a temporary measure which will be reviewed.
Regarding the wait-out period, Mr Lee said on Friday that private residential property owners “generally have more means to buy resale flats”, compared to first-time home buyers or existing HDB flat owners.
“Some may not even need to take loans to complete their purchase,” he said.
“They therefore tend to pay higher amounts of cash-over-valuation when they buy resale flats.”
He also reiterated that this will moderate demand for HDB resale flats and keep them affordable, especially for first-time home buyers who “may have more pressing housing needs”. 
""The Government remains committed to keep public housing inclusive, affordable and accessible to Singaporeans. We will continue to monitor the property market and adjust our policies to ensure that they remain relevant,"" the authorities assured on Thursday in their statement.
""We urge households to exercise prudence before taking up any new loans, and be sure of their debt-servicing ability before making long-term financial commitments.""

In December, the Government announced a set of measures to cool the private residential and HDB resale markets.
This included raising Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates, tightening the total debt servicing ratio threshold and lowering the LTV limit for loans.
ABSD rates for Singapore citizens and permanent residents purchasing their first residential property remained unchanged at 0 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. However, it was increased for those buying a second or a third and subsequent residential property.
The Government also tightened the total debt servicing ratio threshold from 60 per cent to 55 per cent, which means new mortgages cannot cause borrowers' total monthly loan repayments to exceed 55 per cent of their monthly income.
It had also earlier cut the LTV limit for HDB loans, from 90 per cent to 85 per cent.

Man charged for causing alarm after allegedly making bomb threat on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33 ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-airlines-bomb-threat-sq33-charged-court-2974596,"SINGAPORE: A 37-year-old man who was arrested after allegedly assaulting cabin crew and claiming that he had a bomb on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33 was charged in court on Thursday (Sep 29).
""Preliminary investigations indicate that during the flight, the man had allegedly shouted that there was a bomb on the plane and grabbed another passenger’s luggage from the cabin’s overhead compartment,"" the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement.
A member of the cabin crew who tried to intervene and restrain La Andy Hien Duc was allegedly assaulted, said the police.
Checks by the cabin crew did not reveal any suspicious items in the American's luggage, they added.
The police told CNA on Wednesday that it was alerted to an alleged bomb threat on board flight SQ33 from San Francisco to Singapore.
The man was restrained by the crew, and police subsequently arrested him for making false threats of terrorist acts and for suspected consumption of controlled drugs.
The plane landed safely at Changi Airport at about 5.50am, under the escort of Republic of Singapore Air Force F-16C/D fighter jets.
Officers from the Airport Police Division and Special Operations Command’s K-9 Unit, as well as the Singapore Armed Forces’ Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group, were mobilised to investigate the threat, which turned out to be false.
As a result of the additional security measures, there was a delay of more than four hours in disembarkation. The 17 crew and 208 passengers disembarked at only around 9.30am, the police said on Thursday.
""Preliminary investigations by the Central Narcotics Bureau revealed that the man’s urine tested positive for controlled drugs,"" SPF added.

The American was charged with offences read with a section of the Tokyo Convention Act 1971, which allows offenders to be charged under Singapore laws if a crime takes place on a Singapore-controlled aircraft flying outside of the country.
He was also remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation and will return to court on Oct 13, according to court documents.
If found guilty of using threatening words likely to cause alarm, he could be fined up to S$5,000. The offence of voluntarily causing hurt carries a penalty of up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.
The police warned that they will not hesitate to take action against anyone who causes public alarm with false threats.
""Beyond the fear and inconvenience caused to other members of the public, the making of false threats comes at a cost, in the extensive public resources that have to be deployed to deal with the incident,"" they said."
"Singapore, UK commit to jointly promote capacity-building in Southeast Asia",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/united-kingdom-asean-third-country-training-vivian-balakrishnan-james-cleverly-mfa-2974381,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and the United Kingdom on Thursday (Sep 29) signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly promote capacity-building in Southeast Asia.
The MOU on the Singapore-UK Third Country Training Programme was signed by Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan and the UK’s secretary of state for foreign, commonwealth and development affairs James Cleverly.
Mr Cleverly, who was appointed as UK foreign minister earlier this month, was in Singapore to conclude a three-day visit to the region which included stops in Japan and South Korea.
The MOU “reaffirms the excellent state of bilateral relations and extensive cooperation between Singapore and the UK”, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a press release.
It builds on both countries’ strengths in international development cooperation, including through the sharing of best practices in sustainable development, the ministry added.
The MOU also supports a plan of action to implement an ASEAN-UK dialogue partnership, by exchanging best practices in areas of complementary expertise and capacity-building for Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states.
The Third Country Training Programme is among several technical cooperation partnerships under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, a flagship platform for extending technical assistance to fellow developing countries, said MFA.
Established in 1992, the cooperation programme has hosted almost 150,000 officials from more than 180 countries and territories as well as international and regional organisations.

On Thursday, Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Cleverly discussed ways to enhance cooperation in areas including the digital economy and clean energy. They also exchanged views on global and regional developments.
Dr Balakrishnan welcomed the UK’s interest to deepen its engagement of the region, including through the ASEAN grouping, said MFA.
Earlier on Thursday, Mr Cleverly called on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and met Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
Mr Cleverly will leave Singapore on Thursday.

"Daily round-up, Sep 29: Singapore authorises Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for young children; Taiwan to end COVID-19 quarantine for arrivals",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pfizer-moderna-covid19-vaccine-kids-taiwan-travel-tradenation-ash-scattering-2973761,"Let's get you up to speed with the day's stories.
Singapore authorises Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months through 4 years
Pfizer’s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use in children aged six months through four years. The vaccination regimen for the primary series in this age group consists of three 3-microgram doses.
The first two doses should be administered three weeks apart, followed by a third dose to be administered at least eight weeks after the second dose, the Health Sciences Authority said.
Clinical data, based on an ongoing trial conducted by Pfizer, showed that the immune response in young children with a three-dose primary series was comparable to that in adults aged 16 to 25 years who received two higher doses of 30 micrograms as the primary series vaccine.
This is Singapore's second vaccine authorised for use in young children. The first, Moderna’s two-dose Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine, was in August approved for use in children aged six months to five years.
The Moderna vaccine will be available next month, while the Pfizer shot is expected to be available by the end of the year, MOH said.
Putin to annex 4 Ukrainian territories in Kremlin ceremony on Friday
Russian President Vladimir Putin will on Friday (Sep 30) begin formally annexing 15 per cent of Ukrainian territory, presiding at a ceremony in the Kremlin to declare four Ukrainian regions part of Russia.
Agreements will be signed with Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions - ""all four territories that held referendums and made corresponding requests to the Russian side"", his spokesman said.
Ukraine and the West have rejected the hastily arranged votes, held in the occupied territories seven months after Russia's invasion, as illegitimate shams conducted at gunpoint.
Taiwan to end COVID-19 quarantine for arrivals, welcome back tourists
Taiwan will end its mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for arrivals from Oct 13. Arrivals will still need to monitor their health for a seven-day period and take rapid tests.
A series of other measures came into force on Thursday (Sep 29), including ending polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for arrivals and resuming visa-free entry for citizens of all countries that previously had that status.
Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng told reporters that with a well vaccinated population and the pandemic under control at home, the time had come to reopen borders.
Jail for men who helped smuggle suspects in Tradenation luxury goods scam out of Singapore in lorry
Two logistics workers who conspired to help smuggle the suspects in the multimillion-dollar Tradenation luxury goods scam out of Singapore in a lorry were sentenced to jail on Thursday (Sep 29).
Mohamed Alias, 40, and Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, received a year's jail each.
The two worked together to help smuggle Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and Thai national Pansuk Siriwipa into Malaysia for a fee. Pi and Pansuk were under investigation by the Singapore Police Force at the time over a series of alleged cheating cases.
In mitigation, both Fazli and Alias said they needed support their family.
Ash scattering garden in Choa Chu Kang receives 1,900 applications; another site to open by 2024: NEA
A new inland ash scattering site will open at Mandai by 2024. Called the Garden of Serenity, it will be introduced with the new Mandai Crematorium Complex.
The new complex will be Singapore's second such facility. Initially expected to be completed by end-2022, it was delayed, with its main contractor Greatearth Construction citing financial difficulties in 2021. 
The first one at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex, which opened in May 2021, has received more than 1,900 applications as of mid-September. 
With Singapore's ageing population, the annual number of deaths in the country is projected to double, said NEA. The projected doubling of annual deaths would drive demand for after-death services infrastructure and industry manpower."
"Singapore, US to explore viability of ‘green lanes’ to advance sustainable aviation","The agreement between Singapore and the US will encourage the gradual uptake of flights operating on sustainable aviation fuels by corporate and individual travellers, said the Transport Ministry and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-united-states-green-lanes-sustainable-aviation-fuel-s-iswaran-2973736,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and the United States are looking into developing “green lanes” between the two countries in a move to advance sustainable aviation, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) in a joint media release on Thursday (Sep 29).
This is part of a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) signed by Singapore’s Transport Minister S Iswaran and US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday on the sidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assembly held in Montreal, Canada.
Under the agreement, Singapore and the US will collaborate and exchange information in areas such as policy and regulation, industry development, future infrastructure planning and provision, as well as workforce transformation, said MOT and CAAS.
The agreement will drive the research and development, test bedding and trial of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) as well as facilitate the development of secure sustainable fuels supply chains, the authorities added.
It will also encourage the gradual uptake of SAF-operated flights by corporate and individual travellers, they said.
“Singapore and the United States share mutual interests in advancing aviation sustainability, particularly as climate change is a global challenge that directly affects international civil aviation,” said Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations.
“This Memorandum of Cooperation is a testament of our shared vision to foster such partnerships, and we look forward to working closely with the United States in advancing aviation sustainability,” he said.
He added that coordinated state action and collaboration between the public and private sectors is key to drive and support global climate action.

SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL AVIATION
During the assembly, Mr Iswaran also highlighted Singapore’s firm commitment to support ICAO in its efforts to build a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for international aviation, MOT said in a separate news release.
“Singapore continues to stand ready to work with all stakeholders to contribute to these efforts for the benefit of all States,” added MOT.
Together with Senior Minister of State for Transport Dr Amy Khor, who also attended the assembly, Mr Iswaran met with Mr Salvatore Sciacchitano, president of the ICAO council and Mr Juan Carlos Salazar, who is ICAO's secretary-general.
Mr Iswaran and Dr Khor reaffirmed Singapore’s strong support for the ICAO’s work and leadership, including in areas of aviation recovery, sustainability, and training, said MOT.
In his statement during the ICAO assembly, the Transport Minister said climate change is an ""existential challenge” for all states.
“The global aviation community must adopt sustainability as an urgent long-term priority and act decisively to reduce the sector’s emissions,” Mr Iswaran said.
“Under the leadership of ICAO, the sector has taken important steps in this regard and we must continue working together to sustain the momentum in decarbonising air travel.”
Wrapping up his statement, Mr Iswaran noted that other challenges continue to lie ahead even as countries emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“To prevail, we will need to address the critical areas of capacity, talent, technology, and sustainability, while strengthening the aviation system’s fundamentals,” he added.
On Wednesday, Singapore also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Kingdom to update the Open Skies Agreement between the two countries and work together to promote the sustainable development of aviation.
The agreement allows air carriers to operate any number of flights between and beyond both signatory states.
In the joint media release on Thursday, MOT and CAAS said the agreement with the US is “another step forward” in Singapore’s sustainability aviation journey.
Other efforts include a one-year pilot - starting February 2022 - on the use of sustainable aviation fuel at Changi Airport.
An agreement on sustainable aviation with New Zealand was also signed in April.
Last week, the International Advisory Panel submitted a report on sustainable air hub detailing 15 key initiatives to tackle decarbonisation across the airport, airline and air traffic management domains.
“MOT and CAAS will study the recommendations and incorporate them into the development of the sustainable air hub blueprint,” said the authorities, adding that CAAS will publish the blueprint next year to provide a decarbonisation roadmap for Singapore."
"Man fined S$17,500 for illegally importing more than 200kg of meat into Singapore",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-fined-17500-illegally-importing-more-200kg-meat-changi-airport-china-2973781,"SINGAPORE: A traveller who arrived from China was fined S$17,500 on Thursday (Sep 29) for illegally importing more than 200kg of meat – including rabbit – into Singapore.
Wang Liansheng was caught on Jun 8, after officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at Changi Airport found about 226kg of frozen meat products in eight bags belonging to him.
The meat included chicken, beef, pork, mutton and rabbit meat from China.
ICA then alerted the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the meat products were seized and destroyed.
SFA noted that food imports into Singapore must meet its requirements.
“Food can only be imported by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit,” it said. “Illegally imported food products are of unknown sources and poses food safety risk.”
It added that meat and meat products can only be imported from accredited sources in approved countries that comply with food safety standards and requirements.
Offenders who illegally import meat products from unapproved sources could be fined up to S$50,000, jailed for up to two years or both upon first offence.
Those who are convicted for a subsequent offence could be fined up to S$100,000, jailed for up to three years or both."
Jail for man who let scammers funnel S$1.5 million through his bank accounts,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-man-who-let-scammers-funnel-s15-million-through-his-bank-accounts-2973656,"SINGAPORE: A man agreed to illegally open bank accounts for use by another person in exchange for money, and more than $1.5 million was eventually moved through these accounts. 
The offender also pocketed more than S$5,900 from a durian supplier he worked for, took drugs and falsely accused an investigation officer working on his case such that the case was reassigned.
Jorell Kay Wei Hoe, 31, was sentenced on Thursday (Sep 29) to one year and 10 months' jail. 
He pleaded guilty to seven charges including cheating, drug consumption and criminal breach of trust as an employee. Another eight charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that an acquaintance of Kay's approached him in 2019 with a proposal. He offered Kay S$800 per month for every corporate bank account and S$500 per month for every personal bank account that Kay delivered to him.
Kay did not know and did not check what the acquaintance would use the bank accounts for, but agreed.
Kay registered a business and opened a UOB corporate account for the business in October 2019. He also opened a CIMB personal account under his own name that same month, and surrendered control of both accounts to his acquaintance.
The accounts were used to receive and make fund transfers. A total of S$1,472,342 was deposited into the UOB account in December 2019, with almost all the money withdrawn that same month. The CIMB account was similarly used for fund transfers, including S$80,000 from a love scam.
The victim of the scam, a Singaporean woman, made a complaint to the police on Dec 30, 2019, saying that she had met someone online who asked her to lend him money for his business.
The scammer promised to return her the money on top of commission from his businesses, and the victim transferred a total of S$160,000 to various bank accounts at his instruction.
Of this amount, S$80,000 went to Kay's CIMB account.
Another scam victim made a complaint to the police on Aug 31, 2020, saying that he was scammed by a person he had met online. The person asked him to transfer S$400,000 for a cryptocurrency investment. He did so, but realised later that it was a scam.
Of this amount, S$31,000 was transferred to Kay's UOB account.
HE MADE A POLICE REPORT AGAINST HIS OWN IO
On Sep 3, 2020, an investigation officer attached to an anti-scam team under the Singapore Police Force contacted Kay over the cryptocurrency scam.
Four days later and before the pair had met, Kay called the police officer. The officer asked Kay for his identity, but Kay said he did not need to know who he was. He said the officer just needed to know that a police report was made against him and that it would be ""the downfall of his career"".
Later that same day, Kay made a police report over the phone. He claimed that someone had told him that the investigation officer had taken bribes to get passes for a government programme - the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme - approved.
He claimed that the officer earned a cut from this, and alleged that his secondary school friend had told him about it.
Because of Kay's false report, the police investigated the investigation officer looking into Kay's case. Kay's case was reassigned to a different investigation officer.
Kay later admitted in police interviews that ""there is no such thing that happened which I have said"".
Kay was also sentenced for pocketing S$5,971 in cash belonging to a durian supplier he was working for in September 2020.
He was arrested at a staircase in Holland Drive on May 11, 2021 on suspicion of drug-related offences. A packet of methamphetamine was found on him and his urine samples contained the drug.
He admitted that he had been smoking meth every day for two to three months before his arrest.
The prosecutor asked for at least two years' jail, noting that Kay had committed ""a whole slew of offences"" including drug and cheating offences. Some of them were committed after Kay was already being investigated, he said.

Singapore authorises Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months through 4 years,"The three-shot Pfizer vaccine for this age group is expected by the end of the year, while Moderna's will be available next month.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccine-young-children-pfizer-comirnaty-moderna-spikevax-6-months-4-years-2973591,"SINGAPORE: Pfizer's Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for children aged six months through four years, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) announced on Thursday (Sep 29). 
The vaccination regimen for the primary series in this age group consists of three 3-microgram doses over at least 11 weeks.
The first two doses should be administered three weeks apart, followed by a third dose to be administered at least eight weeks after the second dose. 
Official recommendations on the use of this vaccine will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH), said HSA. 
The agency said it had carefully considered the clinical data and assessed that the benefits outweighed the risks for the use of Comirnaty in children aged six months through four years. 
""In making this regulatory decision, HSA also consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts,"" it added. 
This is Singapore's second vaccine authorised for use in young children. The first, Moderna’s two-dose Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine, was in August approved for use in children aged six months up to five years. 
The Moderna vaccine in 25 microgram doses will be available next month, while the Pfizer shot is expected to be available by the end of the year, MOH said in response to media queries.
""Vaccinations and boosters remain a critical part of our strategy in ensuring our children are well protected against severe illness, should they be infected with COVID-19,"" said MOH.
""We encourage everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated when it is offered to them.""

New bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine doses expected to be available in Singapore by end-Sep: Moderna



















CNA Explains: What is a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, and how will it protect me?













Singapore began vaccinating children aged five to 11 on Dec 27, 2021, after the Comirnaty vaccine was approved for that age group. 
Health authorities are preparing to roll out booster shots for this age group in the fourth quarter of the year.
THE CLINICAL DATA 
For the Comirnaty vaccine, HSA said the clinical data it reviewed was based on an ongoing Phase 2/3 study conducted by Pfizer, involving about 1,800 participants aged six months through four years. 
""The results showed that the immune response in young children with a three-dose primary series was comparable to that in adults aged 16 to 25 years who received two higher doses of 30 micrograms as the primary series vaccine,"" said HSA.
""Hence, it can be inferred that three doses of the vaccine may provide a similar level of protection in young children as that of two doses in adults.""
It added that local real-world data in children aged five to 11 had shown that vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron COVID-19 subvariants was estimated to be around 40 per cent for symptomatic disease. 
Vaccine effectiveness also remained high - at more than 80 per cent  - for protection against COVID-related hospitalisations for children receiving two doses of Pfizer vaccines. 
""It could reasonably be expected that the vaccine would similarly protect younger children aged six months through four years from severe outcomes of COVID-19 such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome and other potential complications,"" said HSA.
Preliminary data from a secondary analysis of COVID-19 cases in the clinical study also suggested that vaccine efficacy was estimated to be around 73 per cent.
But ""the evidence was limited and should be interpreted with caution"", HSA warned. 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
The clinical studies also revealed that adverse events in young children were similar to those reported in adults. 
These were mild to moderate in severity and commonly reported with childhood vaccination, such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue and headache, said HSA. 
""These reactions are generally associated with vaccinations and expected as part of the body’s natural response to build immunity against COVID-19. They usually resolve on their own within a few days,"" added the authority. 
HSA said there were no cases of serious adverse events such as myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) reported in the clinical study with Comirnaty. 
But caregivers of young children should monitor for signs and symptoms of myocarditis such as chest pain and breathing difficulty, and also minimise rigorous physical activity following vaccination, said HSA.
The authority said it would continue to actively monitor the safety of the vaccine and require Pfizer to submit data from the ongoing clinical study. 
""HSA will take the necessary actions and provide updates to the public if any significant safety concerns are identified,"" it added.

Jail for men who helped smuggle suspects in Tradenation luxury goods scam out of Singapore in lorry,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-men-helped-smuggle-suspects-tradenation-luxury-goods-scam-out-singapore-lorry-pi-jiapeng-pansuk-siriwipa-mohamad-alias-fazli-2973561,"SINGAPORE: Two logistics workers who conspired to help smuggle the suspects in the multimillion-dollar Tradenation luxury goods scam out of Singapore in a lorry were sentenced to jail on Thursday (Sep 29).
Mohamed Alias, 40, and 38-year-old Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman received a year's jail each. They each pleaded guilty to two charges under the Immigration Act of abetting a person to leave Singapore illegally.
The court heard that 26-year-old Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and 27-year-old Thai national Pansuk Siriwipa were under investigation by the Singapore Police Force at the time over a series of alleged cheating cases.
These cases were in relation to Pi and Pansuk's companies, which were in the business of trading luxury products. According to past reports, at least 180 police reports involving the two companies Tradenation and Tradeluxury were made from June.
As part of investigations, the couple surrendered their passports to the police in June this year.
Around Jul 3, an unidentified acquaintance of Fazli's, known only as Anson, contacted him. He asked Fazli to find a driver to smuggle two people out of Singapore the next day. 
Fazli agreed to do so in exchange for 16,000 ringgit (S$5,025). That same day, he called Alias, who was his colleague in the same Malaysian logistics company. Alias, a Malaysian, worked as a lorry driver making deliveries from Malaysia to Singapore.
Fazli, who is also Malaysian and based there, asked Alias if could smuggle two people out of Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint. Alias agreed to do so for a fee.
On Jul 4, 2022, Alias drove a Malaysia-registered lorry to a self-storage facility in Ang Mo Kio to perform a delivery order. He shared his location with Fazli.
On Anson's instruction, Fazli told Alias to wait for the couple there. Around 5pm that day, Pi and Pansuk arrived and told Alias they were there to take a ride in the lorry.
Alias understood from this that they were the couple to be smuggled. The pair sat in the passenger seats, and Alias drove them to Tuas Checkpoint, alerting Fazli of the successful pick-up.
As they neared Tuas Checkpoint, Alias told the couple to hide in the rear container of the lorry, and they did so.
At the checkpoint, the immigration officer did the standard clearance for the lorry to leave Singapore, and no spot check on the container was conducted.
Alias drove out of Singapore and entered Johor Bahru with the couple in the lorry. He then called Fazli to report the update to him, and was instructed to let the couple alight at a flyover near Johor Checkpoint.
The couple alighted and was later picked up by an unidentified driver. On Jul 5, 2022, Fazli received 16,000 ringgit from Anson via bank transfer. He handed 11,000 ringgit to Alias in cash.
Police investigations into the couple identified Alias and Fazli and warrants of arrest were issued. Alias was arrested on Jul 14, 2022, after he was detained at Tuas Checkpoint.
Fazli was arrested by the Malaysian police later that month and handed over to SPF. The couple was arrested in Johor Bahru on Aug 11 and taken to Singapore.
Both Fazli and Alias were unrepresented. Fazli said in mitigation that he was supporting his parents and needed to take his mother to the hospital every month. He also said his wife was not working and that he had three children, adding that he needed to pay for his house and car.
Alias also said his wife was not working and that he had three young children and elderly parents to support. He said he was deeply remorseful for his actions and had given full cooperation during investigations.
District Judge Bala Reddy noted that the accused persons' conduct was ""fuelled by pecuniary gain"". He agreed with the prosecutor that the pair had helped not one but two people leave Singapore illegally.
Investigations and proceedings against the couple are ongoing.

Former operations manager charged with collecting kickbacks from migrant workers ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kickbacks-migrant-workers-former-operations-manager-charged-2973456,"SINGAPORE: A former operations manager of a conservancy company was charged on Thursday (Sep 29) for allegedly collecting kickbacks from migrant workers as a condition for their employment or renewal of their work passes.
Ho Chiak Hock Derrick, who was working for Lian Cheng Contracting, is accused of demanding close to S$400,000 from 56 migrant workers on multiple occasions since 2014.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it began investigating the allegations against Ho in November 2020. 
""The monies were either collected by Ho directly, or through three migrant workers acting on Ho’s instructions,"" said the ministry in a media release. 
""These three workers themselves had allegedly paid kickbacks as a condition for renewal of their work passes.""
Ho, 53, faces 61 charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA).
He was offered bail of S$30,000 and is scheduled to appear in court in October.
If found guilty, Ho can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$30,000, or both for each charge.   
“Collecting kickbacks from migrant workers is a serious offence,” said the Manpower Ministry, adding that it will take stern action against offenders or errant companies.
This includes barring them from applying for new work passes and from renewing their existing work passes. 
The ministry said migrant workers who suspect that they are giving kickbacks can seek help by calling MOM at 6438 5122 or the Migrant Workers’ Centre at 6536 2692.

Sentence of sex offender almost halved following appeal as High Court clarifies law,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sentence-sex-offender-almost-halved-following-appeal-high-court-clarifies-law-2973396,"SINGAPORE: The High Court has reduced the sentence of a sex offender from six years and three strokes of the cane to three-and-a-half years' jail with no caning after he successfully appealed.
In a judgment released on Thursday (Sep 29), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon clarified several complexities in the case and said the framework for specific sex cases has not been correctly applied so far.
The appellant, who was not named, was sentenced by a district court after pleading guilty to one count of sexual assault by penetration of a minor below 14, with six other charges taken into consideration.
He was 28 when he volunteered as a facilitator for children's classes at a religious organisation. 
He met the victim in early 2020 when she picked her siblings up from the classes. The appellant began a relationship with the victim when she started volunteering at the same organisation.
They would meet at a shopping centre and talk, kiss and hug at a staircase landing. The appellant began touching the victim and sexually assaulted her when he knew she was between 13 and 14 years old. He also asked her for nude videos and was arrested after the victim's mother checked her phone.
DEFENCE'S ARGUMENTS FOR LOWER SENTENCE
The appellant's lawyers, Mark Yeo and Chloe Chen of Kalco Law, argued that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. They said that the Pram Nair framework - a legal framework for sex cases - did not contemplate the situation of consensual penetrative sexual activity.
The case of Pram Nair was decided prior to amendments to the law in 2019, where a charge under sexual assault by penetration could be brought only if there was no consent. 
The lawyers argued that consent has ""generally been seen as a significant mitigating factor"" in such cases, and said that the Pram Nair framework should be modified or redeveloped when dealing with sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 14 with consent. 
The defence argued that prospective overruling should be invoked in this case, and that the appellant should be sentenced based on the previous sentencing regime as the Pram Nair framework has not generally been applied in cases of sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 14 with consent.
THE COURT'S DECISION
The Chief Justice analysed the law both before and after the 2019 amendments, laying out the new prescribed punishments in tables. He said that consent is irrelevant for establishing liability under sexual assault by penetration.
""Although where there is no consent, the mandatory minimum punishment will apply,"" he said. ""The absence of consent is therefore an aggravating factor. But the fact that such a victim under the age of 14 may have consented is otherwise irrelevant and it is not correct to see consent in this context as a mitigating factor.""
He said Parliament has made it clear that in the case of a victim below the age of 14, consent is irrelevant, although the lack of consent will aggravate the offence.
Chief Justice Menon said that the 2019 amendments brought about ""no substantive change"" that is material to this case.
However, he noted that this is the first case concerning a victim below the age of 14 who consented to acts of sexual assault by penetration that was prosecuted under Section 376 after the 2019 amendments. Therefore, he found it important to clarify the sentencing framework.
The Chief Justice said that 61 cases for the relevant section of sexual penetration of a minor below 16 have been prosecuted since 2001. Of these, 46 cases resulted in sentences of four years or less, and caning was imposed in only seven cases.
Ten cases resulted in sentences of between four and eight years, and only five cases resulted in sentences of more than nine years.
After Pram Nair, there were 49 such cases, and the sentences imposed in 39 of these were jail terms of four years or less. Caning was imposed in only three cases.
Chief Justice Menon said that the sentences in general fall ""far short"" of the Pram Nair framework, which suggests that the framework has not generally been applied in cases where a victim is under the age of 14 but consents.
Another suggestion is that sentencing in these cases had proceeded on the basis that consent was regarded as a significant mitigating factor, but the Chief Justice stressed that this was a mistaken approach to sentencing which has worked to the benefit of offenders.
""While there are limitations to the (data) search, the results paint the clear picture that Pram Nair has not been correctly applied to (such) cases, if it has been applied at all,"" said Chief Justice Menon.
As a result, there is a ""gross discrepancy"" between the appellant's sentence and sentences imposed in previous similar cases. The Chief Justice then invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling.
In prospective overruling, a court may in an exceptional case state that clarified guidelines come into effect from a specific date. In such a case, the guidelines would apply to all offenders sentenced after the date of the decision, but it would not apply to the actual offender in the decision.
In other words, the Pram Nair framework should be applied correctly henceforth, but the appellant in this case will be exempt.
Chief Justice Menon said there would be ""serious and demonstrable injustice"" if the appellant's sentence of six years' jail and three strokes of the cane was maintained.
""As I have explained, the overwhelming majority of (similar) cases resulted in sentences below four years' imprisonment with no caning,"" he said.
He concluded that future cases should be dealt with by applying the Pram Nair framework."
"7,400 tickets issued for smoking in prohibited areas in first half of 2022; enforcement action at newly banned sites to begin Oct 1",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tickets-issued-smoking-prohibited-areas-enforcement-action-oct-1-nea-nparks-pub-sdc-2973141,"SINGAPORE: About 7,400 tickets were issued for smoking in prohibited areas in the first of half of 2022, as enforcement actions against those smoking at newly banned places are set to begin from Saturday (Oct 1).
In 2021, more than 13,000 tickets were issued for smoking in prohibited areas.
At the time, close to 40 per cent of the enforcement actions were taken for smoking in prohibited areas in Housing Board estates at common corridors, staircases, void decks and lift lobbies, as more people worked from home, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) in a news release in March.
From Oct 1, enforcement action will be taken against those smoking at additional public parks and gardens, Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) sites, as well as 10 recreational beaches.
There are more than 100 sites under these categories, joining a list of more than 49,000 places where smoking has been banned. These include entertainment outlets, shopping malls, bus stops and common areas in residential buildings.
Smoking is already banned in some green spaces such as neighbourhood parks in private and public housing estates, reservoirs and nature reserves.
In a joint media advisory on Thursday, NEA, NParks, PUB, and Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said their officers have been authorised to take enforcement action for smoking offences in the newly prohibited places.
Those caught smoking may face a composition fine of S$200.
People caught smoking at the newly prohibited places over the last three months were issued verbal advisories, with the advisory period ending on Sep 30.
The statement said that more than 1,200 verbal advisories were issued from Jul 1 to Sep 25, adding that ""the smokers were receptive when advised not to smoke"" in the prohibited areas.

Man admits joining in grievous assault of victim who asked another patron to stop smoking in coffee shop,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-admits-assault-victim-ask-stop-smoking-coffee-shop-2973301,"SINGAPORE: A man disturbed by the smell of cigarette smoke in a coffee shop asked the culprit to stop smoking, but was soon grievously assaulted by a group of four men.
One of the men in the group pleaded guilty to his role in the attack on Thursday (Sep 29).
Nicholas Yeo Kexiong, 32, admitted to one count of causing hurt to the victim, where the hurt was not intended to be grievous but turned out to be so. Another charge will be considered in sentencing.
The court heard that the 40-year-old victim was at a coffee shop along Kelantan Lane on the night of Aug 15, 2021. He had gone there to meet a friend for drinks to celebrate a birthday.
Separately, Yeo was at the coffee shop with three of his drinking buddies: Lee Kee Fatt, 71, as well as Ng Kah Tiong, 56, and Yuen Tuck Wah, 59.
Lee was smoking in the coffee shop at about 8.30pm and the victim smelled the odour. He requested that Lee stop smoking, but they started arguing instead.
Lee and his three friends began arguing with the victim, but a coffee shop employee separated the group and they returned to their seats.
However, about half an hour later, Lee and Ng approached the victim again and continued the argument. Yeo then joined the quarrel.
The victim complied with the men's request to follow them out of the shop. Outside the coffee shop, the group began attacking the victim.
Various members of the group landed punches on the victim, with Yeo punching his head seven times. They tried throwing a chair and beer bottle at the victim, but missed.
Yeo and another member of the group then lifted the victim's legs over a railing and caused him to fall to the ground below from a height of about 2m.
As a result of the attack, the victim suffered fractures, bruising and abrasions. He was warded for four days, underwent surgery and was given a knee brace. He was also given 48 days of hospitalisation leave.
The prosecutor sought at least 21 months' jail for Yeo. He will return to court for sentencing in November."

On Wednesday (Sep 29), Sport Singapore named Teong as the third swimmer, after Joseph Schooling and Amanda Lim, to be investigated for drug-related offences.
All three had confessed to consuming controlled drugs overseas as TeamSG athletes, but tested negative for controlled drugs during investigations by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), said SportSG.
In a statement received through the Singapore Swimming Association on Thursday, Teong said: ""I would like to apologise to my family, my fellow swimmers and the Singapore Swimming Association. This is something I deeply regret doing and as an elite athlete, I should have known better."" 
“I accept the sanctions given to me and I understand that as a national athlete, I have to adhere to a code of conduct that governs all athletes who wear the Singapore flag. I will strive to be a better version of myself and come back from this stronger.”

Teong's statement comes after apologies by Schooling and Lim, and SportSG said it has issued the three swimmers with letters of warning.
Support for Teong, Schooling and Lim will also be suspended for a month. This means the three carded athletes under the high performance scheme will not receive training assistance grants or have access to sports science and sports medicine facilities and services.
SportSG said the action taken against them ""underscore their responsibility and accountability as national athletes"", adding that it had considered a range of factors, including CNB's findings.
""All three athletes cooperated fully throughout the internal review process, and readily admitted to the consumption,"" SportSG noted.
""They had expressed remorse for their lapses in judgment, and have appealed to be given a second chance to prove themselves and fulfil their roles and responsibilities as national athletes.""
Schooling, Lim and Teong have resolved to avoid controlled drugs in the future, and are ""committed to making amends by contributing back to the sporting community and play a part in education and other efforts to prevent others from making the same mistake"", the agency said.
""SportSG will continue to support all three athletes after the period of suspension, in both their sporting endeavours as well as their continued rehabilitation from this episode.""

"Ash scattering garden in Choa Chu Kang receives 1,900 applications; another site to open by 2024: NEA",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/inland-ash-scattering-garden-choa-chu-kang-applications-mandai-crematorium-serenity-nea-after-death-service-2973056,"SINGAPORE: More than 1,900 applications for inland ash scattering services at Singapore's first such facility were received as of mid-September, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Wednesday (Sep 28), as it announced the opening of another site by 2024.
""As of Sep 13, 2022, there have been more than 1,900 applications for inland ash scattering services at the Garden of Peace @ Choa Chu Kang.""
The inland ash scattering garden at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery Complex, which opened in May 2021, received about 900 applications that year.
A new inland ash scattering site at Mandai is expected to be operational by 2024, the NEA said, as it foresees more demand for after-death facilities and services.
The Garden of Serenity will be introduced with the new Mandai Crematorium Complex, said NEA, adding that more cremators and building fittings will also be progressively installed ""in tandem with demand"".
The new complex, initially expected to be completed by end-2022, was delayed after its main contractor Greatearth Construction ran into financial difficulties in 2021.
ANNUAL DEATHS PROJECTED TO DOUBLE
With Singapore's ageing population, the annual number of deaths in the country is projected to double from about 20,000 in 2016 to 40,000 in 2040, said NEA in its Integrated Sustainability Report 2021/2022. 
The projected doubling of annual deaths would drive demand for after-death services infrastructure and industry manpower.
""Our priority therefore is to ensure adequate provision of after-death facilities in Singapore, and to enhance service standards of the funeral industry,"" it added.
Besides planning the supply of after-death facilities, NEA also operates Singapore's public after-death facilities, providing cremation, burial, columbarium and ash scattering services.
The 9,500 sq m ash scattering garden in Choa Chu Kang is a secular facility open to all faiths. 
Only fine human ashes should be scattered in the garden, and crematoriums provide services to pulverise cremated remains into powder fine ashes. 
After scattering the ashes, families can use watering cans and taps provided to water the area where the ash was scattered, to ensure that the ashes sink into the soil below. At the end of the day when the garden is closed, sprinklers will also wash ashes into the soil, NEA said last year. 
Religious ceremonies or rites like the burning of joss sticks, playing of instruments or music, and food offerings are not allowed in the garden."
One more long weekend in 2023 after revised date for Vesak Day,"Vesak Day will now fall on a Friday, taking the number of long public holiday weekends in 2023 to seven. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2023-long-public-holiday-weekend-vesak-day-2972966,"SINGAPORE: There will be a total of seven long public holiday weekends next year, up from six, following a revision to the date for Vesak Day which will now fall on a Friday. 
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (Sep 29) said that it has gazetted Jun 2, 2023 as the new public holiday for Vesak Day following the Singapore Buddhist Federation's (SBF) announcement on the revised date. The previously announced date for Vesak Day was Jun 3, which is a Saturday.
In a statement on its website, SBF said that it had earlier advised the Manpower Ministry on the Jun 3 date for Vesak Day, as determined in reference to the Standard Chinese-Western Multi-Year Almanac.
""Upon receiving feedback from members of the public, we have verified the date against other Chinese almanacs and have established that based on the Mahayana tradition, the date of Vesak Day 2023 shall fall on Jun 3, 2023 which coincides with the 15th day of the Fourth Lunar Month,"" said SBF. 
The Federation apologised for any inconvenience caused and said that it would conduct additional checks and verifications in future to prevent similar occurrences. 
LONG WEEKENDS
Eight public holidays next year fall on a Friday, Sunday or Monday.
As Chinese New Year falls on consecutive days on Sunday, Jan 22 and Monday, Jan 23 next year, they will be part of a single long weekend of four days. Jan 24, a Tuesday, will also be a public holiday.
Three public holidays fall on a Sunday:
- New Year's Day (Jan 1)
- First day of Chinese New Year (Jan 22)
- Deepavali (Nov 12)
Three public holidays fall on a Monday:
- Second day of Chinese New Year (Jan 23) 
- Labour Day (May 1) 
- Christmas Day (Dec 25) 
Two public holidays falls on a Friday:
- Good Friday (Apr 7) 
- Vesak Day (Jun 2)
The other public holidays are: 
- Hari Raya Puasa (Saturday, Apr 22) 
- Hari Raya Haji (Thursday, Jun 29)
- National Day (Wednesday, Aug 9) 











Employees who are required to work on a public holiday are entitled to an extra day’s salary at the basic rate of pay, in addition to their gross rate of pay for that day, said MOM.
Employers and employees may mutually agree to substitute a public holiday for another working day.
Employers also have the option of granting time-off-in-lieu, based on a mutually agreed number of hours, for working on a public holiday for the following group of employees: Workmen earning more than S$4,500 a month; non-workmen earning more than S$2,600 a month; and all managers and executives.

"Choose from 45 offices, bring your pet on the job: Battle of perks in Singapore's blooming co-working scene",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/co-working-spaces-competition-perks-workbuddy-hybrid-work-flexibility-2925096,"SINGAPORE: When marketing manager Joanne moved back to Singapore after three years of being stuck in Hong Kong due to COVID-19 border restrictions, she found working from home to be impractical, isolating and lonely.
Seeking an office setting for human interaction and better productivity, she used co-working app Workbuddy to try several locations before settling on a WeWork office at 22 Cross Street in Chinatown.
Joanne found her new working environment to be conducive and ""aesthetically pleasing"".
""It has been a great boost to productivity, and really contributed to my mental well-being by allowing me to work effectively in a nice space,"" she said.
The best part of her membership, she added, has been the unlimited coffee and discounted pastries at attached cafe Sarnies by WeWork.
Joanne is part of a group of workers who are relishing the freedom to choose a workspace that fits their needs, as they seek to improve productivity and happiness on the job.
Since COVID-19 workplace restrictions were lifted in April 2022, all employees have been able to return to the workplace. But the pandemic has also brought about a re-examination of the need for flexible work arrangements.
In a study by the Institute of Policy Studies which polled more than 2,000 workers from mid-July last year to April 2022, between 41 and 52 per cent of respondents said hybrid work should be the new norm for workplaces in Singapore.
Employers have been encouraged to permanently offer flexible work arrangements to benefit from better work-life harmony and a more engaged and productive workforce, as espoused by the Ministry of Manpower, the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation.
As more employers answer the call and pay closer attention to the evolution of work, many are turning to co-working spaces as a solution.
These have sprouted up over Singapore in recent years, ensuring that workers are never too far away from a hot-desking option.
Amid intensifying competition to fill their spaces with bodies - especially within Singapore's highly concentrated central business district - these co-working firms are stepping up their game in the quest to provide the ideal work environment.
From dangling benefits such as pet-friendly policies and travel promotions to offering ultimate flexibility in choosing one's office location, here are what some co-working spaces in Singapore are doing to attract members.

FLEXIBILITY IS ""VALUE FOR MONEY""
A 35-year-old HR professional, who declined to be named, summed up his co-working experience as such: ""I could work in a different environment for five days in a week. You can’t put a price on flexibility and ever-changing perspective.""
He has been using co-working spaces for about four years, at locations run by firms such as Spaces and WeWork.
WeWork, the leading flexible space provider in Singapore, operates in 14 locations across the central business district. 
Another provider, The Executive Centre, offers global co-working passes, city passes, dedicated desks and flexible day offices for customers in Asia and Australia, said its Southeast Asia managing director Yvonne Lim.
Co-working app Workbuddy offers a subscription service that provides access to more than 45 spaces across Singapore. 
This added choice and flexibility has been a boon for the Workbuddy community, which is largely made up of start-ups, entrepreneurs and small businesses.
""I have access to options should I ever have an appointment or errand at a particular location,"" said Joanne, the marketing manager who uses Workbuddy.
The app currently offers a one-week free trial for new members. It also keeps memberships on flexible month-by-month rolling plans, rather than long-term contracts, said Workbuddy co-founder Gaurav Joshi.
Mr Achal Sondhi, vice-president of Asia-Pacific growth at energy firm Fluence, said his colleagues initially considered a shared work office or an established office to house a growing team, but found costs prohibitive given COVID-19 restrictions at the time.
""As Singapore opened up from restrictions, our team found benefit in the Workbuddy platform,"" he told CNA.
His colleagues were able to find locations close to their homes, reducing commute time and allowing meetings to be held in different parts of town.
""Having flexible workspace seems to be more value for money versus a fixed location and under-utilising valuable real estate,"" Mr Sondhi added.

PERKS GALORE
A Workbuddy membership entails discounts for circular fashion platform Style Theory and entrepreneur platform Doerscircle, among others.
Such team-ups and collaborations are common within the co-working industry, with each co-working space offering a specially tailored suite of perks for its members.
The Executive Centre, with locations in multiple countries, provides special business travel promotions and exclusive rates at hotels for members who frequently go abroad for business.
Members of Gather Cowork at 22 Martin Road - a primarily residential enclave in Robertson Quay - are encouraged to bring their furry sidekicks to work, courtesy of the space's pet-friendly policy.

For those in the fashion industry, The Cocoon Space has an in-house sewing studio and a resource wall used to explore the use of different fabrics.
The co-working space is operated by the Singapore Fashion Council (SFC), which offers discounts on space rentals along with networking and collaboration opportunities to members at The Cocoon Space. 
There, occupants are typically students, designers and small companies in the design community or related fields, said Pauline Kwan, manager for facilities and customer service at SFC.
WeWork recently launched its largest space in Asia Pacific at 21 Collyer Quay, HSBC's former headquarters in Singapore.
With a net lettable area of more than 220,000 sq ft, the 21-storey building features amenities dedicated to wellness, including a centre operated by Just Jym and The Living Cafe, a health-oriented eatery.

EXPANDING CUSTOMER BASES 
Co-working spaces are also growing beyond housing mostly start-ups and freelancers, by increasingly catering to mid-sized businesses and large enterprise clients.
About 80 per cent of available space at WeWork 21 Collyer Quay is reserved for enterprise customers.
Enterprises now take up more than half of the company's business in Singapore, said Mr Balder Tol, general manager for Australia and Southeast Asia for WeWork.
The Workbuddy app, which served predominantly smaller businesses and start-ups before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, is also attracting a different crowd these days.
""Following COVID-19 we have seen a rise in our enterprise membership as corporates look to reduce their fixed office space and become more agile and flexible. 
""Today we have a healthy 50-50 split of business-to-customer and business-to-business members.""
More than 76 per cent of The Executive Centre's members are multinational companies spanning industries like banking, consulting and IT.
Many of their customers use co-working spaces to connect with like-minded people or just to have some quiet working time to themselves, said Ms Lim, the regional managing director.
She likens the co-working experience at The Executive Centre to staying in an upscale hotel replete with in-house baristas, plush sofas and elegant meeting rooms.
""We are obsessively servicing our clients,"" she added.

"Spike in Singapore hotel room rates reflects pent-up demand; affordable options still available, say experts","The average hotel room rate in Singapore rose to S$259 in July, the highest in nearly 10 years, according to Singapore Tourism Board data.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hotel-room-rates-demand-singapore-staycations-affordable-prices-2954066,"SINGAPORE: The near-decade high in the average room rate for Singapore hotels reflects pent-up demand for travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, but affordable options remain available, industry experts told CNA.
The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) released data earlier this month showing that the average room rate rose to S$259 in July. This was the highest since September 2012, when the average room rate was S$261.66, and almost 70 per cent higher compared with a year ago.
Hotels here are getting a ""flood of enquiries"" from overseas visitors and are seeing a ""desperation"" for rooms, said tourism consultant Christopher Khoo.
""Our international markets (are) opening up and they are starting to do their forward bookings or negotiating rates ... and hoteliers are starting to feel comfortable with quoting higher rates,"" said Mr Khoo, who runs tourism consultancy MasterConsult Services.
""The flood of enquiries right now is really reflecting the pent-up demand that had built up over the two years.""
The corporate and MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) sectors are also helping to drive demand, said another tourism expert, Dr Barkathunnisha Abu Baker.
This is in part due to Singapore's reputation as a safe destination amid the pandemic, said Dr Barkathunnisha, who is the founder of Elevated Consultancy and Training.
""People feel they can trust a country like Singapore and therefore that is driving a lot of demand,"" she said.
""Travel is about consumer confidence,"" Dr Barkathunnisha added. ""When you see a country back to normal in terms of events, promotional campaigns and new attractions are coming up … it is a signal, there’s a cue that is going out there to say to people that … everything is going all right, it’s good, start travelling to Singapore.""
Hotels that CNA contacted all confirmed that demand for rooms has been on the rise.
Pan Pacific Hotels Group said occupancy across its hotels has reached more than 90 per cent, especially during peak holiday periods and long weekends.
""Our room rates are determined by dynamic pricing, reflecting the demand for stays and depending on seasonality, such as public holidays and school holidays,"" said the hotel group. ""With Singapore opening up to international travel and receiving higher tourism levels, demand has risen and influenced the pricing.""

InterContinental Singapore said bookings have risen recently, leading to higher average daily room rates.
The increase in demand is partly due to the resumption of global events such as the International Luxury Travel Market expo earlier this month and the upcoming F1 race, said the hotel's general manager Andreas Kraemer.
The Westin Singapore also said it expects demand from business and leisure international travellers to continue over the next few months.
Analysts pointed out that hotels are raising room rates due to higher operational costs too.
""Manpower costs due to labour crunch, energy costs, the cost of supplies have all gone up. So it's inevitable that the hotels have to raise their rates,"" said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior lecturer in tourism Michael Chiam.
""We also need to factor in that not all hotels are running at full capacity as well. So the capacity part of the equation is still not back to the pre-pandemic level.""
Based on STB figures, the average occupancy rates for hotels in Singapore stood at 79.15 per cent in the month of July. While this is the highest since Jan 2020, the highest occupancy rate in the last decade stood at 93.19 per cent in June 2019.
""DEALS TO BE HAD""
Despite the higher room rates, there are still affordable deals and good bargains for staycations for local residents, said Mr Khoo.
""For Singaporeans, it makes sense to shop around. There will always be deals to be had … Singaporeans who are a little bit diligent will be able to find those deals and that’s what shopping around does for you,"" he said.
""I don’t think every hotel is going to be booked to the gills. Shopping around will find you some reasonable rates to get for your staycation.""
Some will continue to opt for staycations instead of overseas vacations, said Dr Chiam.
""At least for this year, not everybody will go overseas to travel. Hotels are still working very hard to keep our locals in Singapore for the staycation packages. So you look around … there are quite a few interesting staycation packages that there have been selling in the market.
""For those who really cannot travel overseas for one reason or another, they can still shop around – there are still some hotels with good rates.""





Related:














Non-fully vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed to enter Singapore without applying for approval 













The experts were divided on whether the average hotel room rate would continue rising.
Dr Chiam said he believes the average rate will remain largely stable in the months to come, perhaps even dipping slightly.
""If you increase prices and there's still a demand, the price will stay. If you increase price to a point that people think that is so expensive, there is no point in making a purchase, then of course, businesses will know how to adjust their price downwards,"" he added.
""When other cities start opening up, I think what we could most probably see is that there will be an adjustment of prices again. Demand may not be so high.""
On the other hand, Dr Barkathunnisha said that travel and tourism will become more expensive in 2023.
She pointed out that current geopolitical conditions and inflationary pressures mean that operating costs for hotels will remain high.
""Capacity is not going to increase but demand is going to increase largely,"" she added. ""2023 will definitely see prices continue to escalate."""
"Workers must be open to training themselves, but employers must also reward workers adequately: Lawrence Wong","This is especially so for sectors where there is limited scope for productivity improvement for lower-wage workers, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-inflation-lower-wages-workers-lawrence-wong-national-wages-council-2971421,"SINGAPORE: Workers must be open to training themselves and adopting new ways of doing things but employers must also reward workers adequately, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Sep 28). 
Speaking at the National Wages Council (NWC) 50th anniversary dinner, Mr Wong said this applies especially in sectors where there is limited scope for productivity improvement for lower-wage workers. 
“And as consumers, as taxpayers, we must be prepared to share the cost too, by paying a little more to help those who are less advantaged earn more and be valued for their work. And then together we can build a society where no one is left to fend for themselves and where every worker can secure fulfilling and dignified lives,” he said in his speech. 
Singapore must never allow wages to stagnate and income gaps to widen, said Mr Wong. 
“If this were to happen, people will lose hope and grow resentful with a system that they feel does not serve them, or only benefits few. And then trust will very quickly break down and social cohesion will rupture,” he added. 
INFLATION AND WAGES
Singapore faces the immediate challenge of rising inflationary pressures and potential global economic slowdown ahead, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister. 
Inflation in Singapore has reached its highest level since 2008, he noted. 
Singapore's core inflation rose further to 5.1 per cent in August, driven mainly by stronger increases in the prices of food and services. 
This is higher than the 4.8 per cent in July as the inflation figure inches towards a 14-year high.
The last time Singapore reported higher year-on-year core inflation growth was in November 2008, when it stood at 5.5 per cent.
To ensure Singapore can continue to move forward, it must ensure that wages and wage increases are in line with productivity, and manage the risk of a “destabilising wage-price spiral”, where higher wages in turn cause higher prices. 
Singapore is experiencing a very tight labour market - there are more than two and a half job vacancies for every unemployed person, Mr Wong added. 
One reason, Mr Wong said, is that non-resident employment has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels despite the easing of border restrictions. 
“Wage increases are inevitable in such a situation, but we cannot afford for wages to increase too quickly, which will cause us to lose our global competitiveness,” said the Deputy Prime Minister. 
“If this happens, it will hurt both employers and employees. And it will be the most vulnerable workers who will ultimately bear the brunt of the impact if companies cannot sustain themselves.” 
In keeping wage increases sustainable, this could mean that wage increases may not keep up with the higher costs of living faced by many workers in the short term, said Mr Wong. 
“So the Government will do our part to close this gap and help cushion the impact of higher prices, especially for the lower- and lower-middle-income workers,” he added. 
“We are monitoring the situation closely and we will provide more help if necessary.” 
The Government must also help businesses and workers transform, said Mr Wong. 
“In the face of increased technological advancement and disruption, we have to redouble our efforts to encourage skills upgrading and productivity improvements across all sectors of the economy,” he added. 
“This is the only way to secure sustainable wage increases and improve the well-being of Singaporeans.” 
Singapore should continue to uplift lower-wage workers and reduce income inequality in society, said Mr Wong. 
“Because we must always ensure that wage gaps across our society do not move too far apart. And that’s why we focus our efforts on uplifting the wages of those at the bottom 20th percentile,” he added.

IMPORTANCE OF TRIPARTISM
Singapore’s “uniquely tripartite approach” has strengthened trust among all stakeholders, said Mr Wong in his speech, as he acknowledged NWC’s contributions over the last 50 years. 
This is because they are able to discuss and negotiate in good faith, and find common ground in seeking win-win solutions that benefit all parties, he added. 
“And when everyone sees that this approach works and produces results, it spurs them to continue engaging one another and (build) consensus.” 
In the past 10 years, mean gross monthly income from work grew by an average of about 2 per cent per year after accounting for inflation, Mr Wong noted. 
This translates to a constant increase in the standard of living, and the wage increase has been “broadly matched” by productivity growth over the same period. 
The Government launched the Forward Singapore exercise so that Singapore can “continue to pull together as one united people” to take the country forward, said Mr Wong. 
“Through this exercise we will seek feedback and ideas on our policies, and also seek to forge consensus and rally society around our shared aspirations and ideals,” he said, adding that he welcomed participation from tripartite partners. 
“More than ever, NWC will have an important role to play in bringing partners together to champion fair, inclusive and sustainable growth for all. In these challenging times, I’m sure that our instincts to collaborate, to cooperate and to find consensus will see us through.”"
Sandwich generation: How can those caring for the elderly and children take care of their finances?,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sandwich-generation-money-elderly-parents-children-singapore-population-2970826,"SINGAPORE: With low fertility rates and longer life expectancies, Singapore’s population is ageing rapidly.
According to an annual report by the National Population and Talent Division on Tuesday (Sep 27), one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above by 2030. The proportion of the citizen population aged 65 and above is rising, and at a faster pace compared with the last decade.
For those taking care of elderly people and young children – the sandwich generation – doing so can put a strain on finances.
CNA speaks to experts to find out how they can better manage their resources.





      What is a sandwich generation?
  

People who are classed as the sandwich generation find themselves taking care of their children while supporting their elderly parents.
This includes emotional and physical support for the young ones and possibly financial support and assistance with daily tasks for their parents.
“The pressure on this generation, typically those between 35 and 59, is great because of their roles, responsibilities and obligations for care that include the financial, physical and psycho-social aspects of the care,” Ms Ang Bee Lian, director-general of social welfare at the Ministry of Social and Family Development, wrote in a letter in 2015.
Such people normally have their finances split in many ways - saving for their own retirement, their children’s future, and taking care of their parents, among others.

HOW DO YOU ALLOCATE YOUR RESOURCES?
Ms Mabel Tan, a financial services director at Great Eastern, is among those in the sandwich generation. Her son was born with a congenital condition and required open heart surgery. Her parents are retired and she provides for them.
Speaking to CNA’s Money Talks podcast, she said that she had to stop work because of her son’s situation. That period was “very straining”, she added. 
Everyone has finite resources, and how they are allocated is important, she said.
""The proper allocation with clarity will actually help us get ourselves towards where we want to be,” she added.
Mr Tan Chin Yu, a senior client adviser at Providend, said proper planning is needed and the correct priorities need to be set. About 20 per cent of a person's net income should be saved, he added.
“Different people have different resources and means, you want to look at your own resources to work out how much you need to support each one of them (parents and children) but also not forgetting you have your own retirement or needs to take care of,” said Mr Tan.
He said that families should be able to set aside enough cash for short-term liquidities, and that means having enough to cover about three to six months of expenses. That can go up to a year for those who are self-employed or those who have a ""choppy"" income.
Some people inevitably compromise on themselves, but that should not be the case, he said, adding that equal weight should be allocated to children, parents and savings.
There are also options when it comes to providing an education for their children. A ""baseline education"" is essential, said Ms Tan, adding that it does not have to be extravagant.
“My suggestion is that you might want to plan something that (is) probably a local degree course, if really resources are really tight,” said Ms Tan.
Providend's Mr Tan noted that there are also concerns about medical bills for elderly parents, especially those without medical insurance.
""For some, if they don't have adequate medical insurance, then they might see the possibility that they need to support their parents,"" he added.
WHAT IF SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS?
Sometimes, unexpected things happen, such as a child or parent falling seriously ill. With the additional strain of medical bills, how can the sandwich generation cope?
Ms Tan’s father fell ill but did not want to tell her because he did not want to worry her. She only found out about it when she started seeing hospital bills being sent to her home.
She shared with her parents that telling her about it earlier would help her manage the situation better. Her dad subsequently had to undergo major surgery.
“Had I not known about it, I wouldn't then make time to ensure that all the resources are in place,"" she explained.
Ms Tan said that being able to make preparations beforehand gives those in the sandwich generation peace of mind because they can plan for contingencies.
She adds that it is important to “plug all the gaps” when elderly parents are still healthy. This includes getting healthcare insurance for them if they do not have any.
Providend's Mr Tan explained that some reallocation will need to be done when an emergency hits.
""You probably need to tap on some of those future resources and think about how you want to make them back again in the future – by saving more, compromising on your lifestyle, not spending as much in certain cases,"" he said.
Some people might also think about liquidating some assets to tackle short-term issues. 
For those without insurance, they might consider setting aside a ""medical sinking fund"" of about S$200,000 to S$500,000 if they want to seek private medical help.

TALKING ABOUT MONEY
Talking about money with family members can be difficult, and sometimes a taboo subject to a ""certain extent"", said Great Eastern's Ms Tan. Open communication is key.
""We have to explain to them (parents), that I want them to live long and well. And by living long and well, there are ways to help you ensure that you have the confidence to enjoy the life you intended to,"" she explained.
""Because by taking care of themselves, they can actually help me make things better,"" she added.
It can sometimes be awkward to talk to loved ones about resources and money, said Mr Tan.
“I feel that it’s easier when you start with yourself to sort of open up some of these things and probably be very practical about it. It's always about trade-offs, on the concept that there are finite resources.
""I think it’s always useful to get everyone on the same page to say that ‘okay, here are our priorities',"" he said.
HOW CAN YOU GET HELP?
Ms Tan said most people in the sandwich generation feel ""very stressed out"" about their situation.
As for medical bills, every Singaporean is insured using MediShield Life, which means hospital bills are heavily subsidised.
""The good thing to note is that more and more people in the sandwich generation are embracing financial planning and speaking to a trusted adviser to sort things out,"" she added.
If people do invest, it will be prudent to put it into a diversified portfolio of equities and maybe some bonds, said Mr Tan.
""We will say we try to manage the risks from diversification,"" he added.

Singapore Airlines passenger arrested after allegedly making bomb threat; fighter jets scrambled
A 37-year-old man on a Singapore Airlines flight has been arrested after he allegedly assaulted cabin crew and claimed he had a bomb in his carry-on bag, the police said on Wednesday (Sep 28).
Police were alerted to the alleged bomb threat on board flight SQ33 from San Francisco to Singapore at 2.40am on Wednesday. The man was restrained by the crew, and police subsequently arrested him for making false threats of terrorist acts and for suspected consumption of controlled drugs.
The plane landed safely at Changi Airport at about 5.50am, under the escort of Republic of Singapore Air Force F-16C/D fighter jets.
The bomb threat was subsequently verified to be false.
Here's a timeline of what happened on the flight. 
SportSG suspends support to Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim, Teong Tzen Wei for a month after drug-related offences
For a month beginning Oct 1, Sport Singapore will suspend all support for national swimmers Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim and Teong Tzen Wei after they admitted to having taken controlled drugs overseas.
The three carded athletes will not receive training assistance grants or have access to sports science and sports medicine facilities and services during that period. 
This is the first time Teong was named in connection with the drug-related offences. As a spexScholar, he will also have his scholarship benefits withdrawn for one month.
SportSG noted that the athletes had tested negative for controlled drugs while under investigation by the Central Narcotics Bureau for drug-related offences, but admitted to drug use while being TeamSG athletes. 
Schooling, Lim and Teong have been issued with letters of warning.
Malaysia, Thailand woo foreigners and investments with new visa programmes
Malaysia and Thailand have launched initiatives to attract foreigners to live and invest in their countries to give their economies a boost.
Malaysia launched a new premium visa programme (PVIP), while Thailand introduced a long-term resident visa for not only highly skilled talents or remote workers, but also wealthy retirees and the so-called “global citizens”.
Malaysia's programme is open to individuals with an offshore annual income of more than US$100,000. They must also have at least US$218,000 in their bank accounts and pay a one-time fee of about US$44,000 as well as US$22,000 per dependent.
Malaysian business leaders CNA spoke to said that such a programme could be a lucrative source of revenue from abroad but pointed out that the current PVIP framework lacks concrete measures to attract premium investors.
Under Thailand’s new visa, applicants must either have US$80,000 in annual income or half as much if they hold a Master’s degree relevant to their profession, or in some cases, an existing investment of up to US$500,000. In exchange, they get a 10-year long-term resident visa, a work permit and 17 per cent personal income tax - almost half of what others in a similar income bracket would pay.
The Thai government wants to make sure that the wealthy foreigners who visit Thailand will eventually make the country their second home.
It is also looking to wealthy pensioners to participate in its visa scheme, given the wealth and experience they can offer."
"Fans, businesses shift into high gear for F1 Singapore Grand Prix","Demand for reservations at food and beverage (F&B) venues is stronger this year than before the pandemic.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/f1-grandprix-marina-bay-street-circuit-fans-2970946,"SINGAPORE: During the two-year Singapore Formula One Grand Prix hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, superfan Adam Amir would visit parts of the Marina Bay Circuit and reminisce about past races.
""During that time, I've just been visiting the track, saying what could have been with my friends,” recalled the 22-year-old, laughing.
His love affair with the sport started when he was just eight years old.
This year, Mr Amir, who has attended every race at the Marina Bay Street Circuit since 2013, made sure to secure his tickets early for the return of the F1 Grand Prix in Singapore.
“I'm really looking forward to the track action, the sounds, the smell of the fuel and everything,” he told CNA.
This year’s event, which will be held from Sep 30 to Oct 2, is expected to see its biggest turnout since its inaugural race in 2008 - and organisers are anticipating tickets to sell out.





Related:






Ticket sales have already exceeded that of 2019, the last time the race was held in Singapore, Transport Minister S Iswaran said last month. That year, the race drew 268,000 spectators.
Businesses, particularly those in hospitality and events, are also gearing up for an influx of tourists and increased activities celebrating Singapore's biggest event since the pandemic.
SEATS WITH AN F1 VIEW
While most restaurants near the race areas have been fully booked for months, some have just started taking reservations after waiting for official confirmation that diners can still access their venues on race days.
Picotin restaurant, located at The Fullerton Waterboat House and right in the middle of road closures, only released its bookings last Friday after being given the all-clear for customer access to its venue. 
















The European bistro’s dining area boasts a view of Esplanade Drive, a prime strip where F1 drivers have to manoeuvre a tight turn and manage a drag reduction zone that allows them to overtake rivals.
""This is the DRS (drag reduction system) zone going all the way. So we are like right at the corner of the turn. So I hope that will be a thrilling experience for our customers,” said Ashiq Shamsudeen, associate director of Picotin’s systems and customer services.
To ensure smooth service on race weekend, the restaurant said it has doubled its staff strength and reduced its capacity by 20 per cent.
MORE DEMAND THAN BEFORE
Demand for reservations this year is stronger than before the pandemic, and food and beverage (F&B) venues are seeing bookings for bigger groups of patrons, they told CNA.
“I think people just feel more need to socialise again, with bigger groups, now that it's possible. And F1 is obviously the best occasion to do so,” said Dr Martin Bem, owner of Ponte Group, which owns the LeVeL33 restaurant.
“The demand is definitely stronger and more vibrant than before,” he said. “We have reservations for eight or 10 people and above, much more demand on that segment than before COVID-19.”
LeVeL33’s reservations during the F1 weekend for tables on its terrace, which offers aerial views of the bay area and a good length of the F1 circuit, were filled two months ago, Dr Bem said.
F&B company 1-Group said it is expecting a 20 per cent increase in revenue across its dining and nightlife establishments, with many of its central venues almost fully booked.
The group, which has planned F1-centric events including special menus, free-flow beverages, themed parties and a kids’ circuit, said it anticipates the most crowds at its nightlife venues after each race.
“I would say that the nightlife aspect would be one of the key things that people look forward to, and I think we will see most of the crowd there because most people will be at the race during dinner time,” said Ms Immelia Izalena, marketing manager of nightlife and iconic concepts at 1-Group.
“I think it’s towards the later part of the night that we will come alive.”
TAXI DRIVERS TO AVOID F1 AREA
While some businesses are rejoicing the return of the Grand Prix, some taxi drivers may not share that sentiment.
Taxi driver Jimmy Lee told CNA938 that he, and some of his colleagues, will likely avoid the F1 area despite a race-day location surcharge, saying the extra money will not be worth the traffic congestion.
“It’s a no for me. Within one to one-and-half hours you will probably only make one trip (due to heavy traffic) and you gain only an extra S$8,” said Mr Lee.
“That area has too much congestion, which increases the risk of accidents. It’s not worth it.”
With road closures in the Marina Centre and Padang area, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has urged those going to the event to take public transport.
SMRT and SBS Transit have extended the operating hours of some bus and train services for the event.
ANTICIPATION AFTER TWO-YEAR WAIT
While Mr Amir has been catching the F1 Grand Prix in other countries on television, he said that the experience is far from being at the scene of the races.
“You don't feel like you (do) in Singapore,” he said of the atmosphere on the ground at the Marina Bay Street Circuit.
“As an F1 fan, it's just really special. To feel the ground shake when the cars drive past, and to see the fans cheering when their favourite driver gets pole position or the win.""
















Another enthusiast, Shamir Robinson, was also drawn to the sport as a kid when he used to watch it with his father.
He called F1 a “solid form of entertainment” combining sport, speed and technology.
“I think everyone, deep down, always has a bit of a need for thrill, a sense of exhilaration,” said the Ferrari fan.
“The sport, the intensity, the speeds at which they are going and the amount of technological advancements and everything that goes around Formula One, I think it's just fantastic.”
Mr Robinson, whose dream is to watch a race live at the Monza Circuit in Italy, first caught the Singapore GP live when he managed to snag a job as a waiter at the Paddock Club in 2013.
Despite having to serve food and beverages to spectators during the event, he saw the action up close as the exclusive area offered views of the starting grid and main straight.
This year, he is eager to catch in action defending champion Sebastian Vettel, who is possibly racing for the last time in Singapore, having announced his retirement earlier this year.
“Hopefully we get to see some magic,” said Mr Robinson.
F1 is a sport that brings people together and he is proud that Singapore plays host to the race, he added.
“No one can ever take the shine away from the fact that Singapore is the first night race. It’s always going to be a special race in the calendar for any driver, and for any fan.""

"Replace regular salt with alternatives, says HPB in push to reduce sodium intake in Singapore","Singapore residents consume an average of 3,600mg of sodium a day, or more than one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt, nearly double the recommended limit.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/regular-salt-alternatives-lower-sodium-potassium-hypertension-hpb-2968631,"SINGAPORE: To reduce sodium intake in Singapore, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) is pushing people to switch from regular salt to lower-sodium alternatives. 
More than one in three Singaporeans have hypertension, an increase from one in four in 2017, according to the National Population Health Survey in 2020. 
This is a major factor for cardiovascular disease and strokes, and the upward trend applies to all subgroups of age, gender and ethnicity, said HPB in a media briefing on Monday (Sep 28). 
Singapore residents consume an average of 3,600mg of sodium, or more than one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt, a day. This is almost double that of the World Health Organization’s recommended daily limit of less than 2,000mg of sodium.
And sodium intake is growing as people in Singapore eat out more often, said HPB. 
About 75 per cent of Singapore residents’ sodium intake comes from added salt, which refers to salt, sauces or seasoning added to meals. The remaining 25 per cent is “hidden” sodium in processed food. This sets Singapore apart from Western countries where the main contributor of sodium in diets is processed food. 
HPB aims to reduce Singapore’s sodium intake by about 15 per cent over the next five years, shaving off a quarter teaspoon of salt per person per day. 
The Ministry of Health announced earlier this year at the Committee of Supply debate in March that it would introduce measures to curb sodium consumption. 
It said at the time that HPB would work with salt suppliers and the food service sector to encourage the substitution of regular salt used in cooking with lower-sodium alternatives. 
HPB has also ramped up efforts under the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme to spur industry reformulation of lower-sodium salt, sauces and seasonings to further increase the range and variety of healthier choices. 
WHAT ARE LOWER-SODIUM SALT ALTERNATIVES?
Regular salt is made up of 100 per cent sodium chloride, and typically contains 2,000mg of sodium per teaspoon. 
Other popular salts like Himalayan pink salt, sea salt or kosher salt are also mostly sodium chloride, with a small concentration of other minerals that may be marketed as good for health. These also contain about 1,900 to 2,000mg of sodium per teaspoon. 
In many lower-sodium salts, the sodium is partially substituted with potassium. These contain about 1,500mg of sodium per teaspoon or less, about 30 per cent less sodium than regular salt. 
Another common salt Singapore residents may be familiar with is MSG, or monosodium glutamate, which is often used as a flavour additive. MSG contains 12 per cent sodium, which is less than regular salt. 
The public perceives MSG to be unhealthy, but nutritionally it is the same as other naturally occurring sources of flavour enhancers, HPB said.
MSG can be found in foods like tomatoes, cheese or kombu, which is a type of Japanese kelp used for soups. 





      What are sodium and potassium and why do we need them?
  

Sodium is essential in maintaining a healthy blood pressure, but excessive sodium intake promotes water retention, increasing blood volume and blood pressure, said HPB. 
This could cause artery walls to thicken to cope with the strain, narrowing them, which in turn causes blood pressure to increase further. 
This cycle can cause blood vessels to rupture or blood clots to form, leading to heart attacks and strokes. 
Potassium is an essential mineral in our diets, and is found naturally in spinach, broccoli or bananas. 
It works in the opposite way from sodium, helping to ease tension in blood vessels, which helps to lower blood pressure.

Responding to a question about whether Singapore would consider implementing a sodium tax on processed foods that are high in salt, HPB said other countries have done so. 
The authorities will monitor the issue over time and assess the situation, said HPB.
Even if it considers a sodium tax, HPB said it will look at such a move ""holistically"" and whether it can adapt this to the local market.
Currently, lower-sodium salt alternatives have about 2 per cent of the market share, and HPB hopes that with its efforts, this will increase to 50 per cent. 
About 25 per cent of the sauces and seasonings available in Singapore are lower-sodium options and have the Healthier Choice symbol. 
In early October, a new lower-sodium salt named K-salt will hit supermarkets here - K being the chemical symbol for potassium. HPB is also working with major retailers to introduce house brand lower-sodium salt by next year, it said. 
Manufactured by IMI Lifestyle Products, K-salt will retail at S$2.50 for a 400g pack. The company’s managing director Goh Chiew Seng said this will typically last a family about three months. 
“It is not expensive actually,” he added. 
“We are hoping that there’ll be higher demand, but … we are fighting the habit too. We are all creatures of habit, so hopefully we can change that habit in a significant way, because national health is involved and the implication of a high sodium intake for any country is not very good.” 
The average Singaporean consumes 2,500mg of potassium per day, below the recommended 3,500mg to 4,700mg, said the health authorities. 
Substituting regular salt with a lower-sodium salt alternative that contains potassium could boost daily intake, reducing blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease, said HPB. 
For example, each teaspoon of K-salt provides an average of 700mg of potassium, based on the 30 per cent potassium replacement in the salt.

How much salt are you consuming? Everyday foods you didn’t know were packed with sodium



















MOH to introduce measures to curb salt consumption













IMI, which has been around for more than 20 years, is already bringing in a lower-sodium salt under the GoodSalt brand. Available in supermarkets, GoodSalt is a mineral salt with half the sodium content and added magnesium and potassium. 
However, most alternatives like GoodSalt currently cost about 10 times more than regular salt. 
IMI developed K-salt with HPB’s support under the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme. This is why K-salt is expected to be priced at just three to four times more than regular salt, similar to the prices of “natural” salts like sea salt or kosher salt. 
About 10 salt, sauces and seasoning suppliers have tapped on the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme, and HPB expects two to three more salt suppliers to join the scheme next year. 
“Of course, added ingredients mean increased production costs. The ingredients themselves are also slightly more expensive. But really the bottom line is volume. Where there’s enough volume, the price should be affordable to almost every family anywhere in the world,” said Mr Goh. 








      K-salt is set to hit supermarkets in early October 2022, and will retail at S$2.50 for a 400g pack. 
    




      In many lower-sodium salts like K-salt, the sodium is partially substituted with potassium.
    







HOW DOES IT TASTE?
But how does lower-sodium salt taste compared with regular salt? According to HPB, switching to these alternatives will not compromise the taste of your food. 
Close to 150 caterers have switched to these lower-sodium salts, sauces and seasonings as a default, and HPB is hoping to partner major food chain operators like Foodfare and Kopitiam to do the same. 
LPH Catering has made the switch to K-salt permanently. The food caterer's general manager Shoan Lee said his chefs tested the K-salt in dishes and found the transition “smooth”. 
“We tried and we realised that it’s easy to tweak the taste of the dishes,” Mr Lee said, adding that most recipes did not have to be tweaked at all. 
“It doesn’t really affect the dishes’ taste, and it’s also healthier, so we were very convinced to change (the salt we use).”

In testing whether a switch to lower-sodium salts would be feasible for the food service industry, HPB worked with two caterers, Sodexo and NTWU Canteen, in a four-week trial last year. 
The trial found that the amount of sodium used in each meal was significantly lower, at about 450mg a meal. This also included results from switching out sauces and seasonings to lower-sodium alternatives. 
Chefs also found it convenient to use lower-sodium salt and did not have to change their recipes, said HPB. The cost increase was less than 0.1 cent a meal. 
More than 80 per cent of the employees who ate at the canteens also said the food tasted the same. 
Salt is needed for marinating food and seasoning, and it is sometimes not feasible to reduce the amount used, LPH Catering's Mr Lee said. 
While it took “a little bit of effort” to convince his “very traditional” chefs, Mr Lee said they came around after he cooked the food himself with K-salt and asked them to taste the food. 
After switching to the new K-salt, LPH Catering told its customers about the change and that they could opt for a healthier menu. 
“There’s really no feedback on what they think. So I would think that no feedback is good feedback,” said Mr Lee. “It didn’t change the taste of the dishes, so it wasn’t like (if) you choose the healthier choice, you’re eating very bland food.”"
WhatsApp users urged to update app to latest version after vulnerabilities reported: SingCERT,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/whatsapp-vulnerability-bug-hacker-update-singcert-2970916,"SINGAPORE: WhatsApp users should update to the latest version of the popular messaging app after two ""remote code execution"" vulnerabilities were reported, the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) said in a notice on Wednesday (Sep 28).

Singapore's SATS buying Worldwide Flight Services for S$1.65 billion to create global leader,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-sats-buy-worldwide-flight-service-create-global-leader-2970631,"SINGAPORE: Singapore-based ground handling services firm SATS is acquiring Paris-based Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) for S$1.65 billion cash, to create the world's biggest global air cargo handler, the companies said.
""This is a transformational opportunity for SATS and our proposed acquisition of WFS will create a global leader,"" Kerry Mok, SATS' CEO, said in a statement on Wednesday (Sep 28).
SATS is buying WFS from an affiliate of US private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management.
The deal will be the biggest acquisition by SATS, which has a market value of S$4.35 billion and counts state investor Temasek Holdings as its single biggest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.
Last week, Bloomberg News reported SATS had sounded out financing for a potential deal which could be worth about S$4.35 billion.
SATS had told the Singapore bourse that it was in talks to buy WFS but said the Bloomberg report contained ""materially inaccurate facts"".
Trading in shares of SATS were halted earlier on Wednesday.
SATS said the purchase would be ""immediately financially accretive"" on a proforma basis and raise SATS' earnings per share by 78 per cent to 3.2 Singapore cents from 1.8 cents reported for the year ended March, and increase revenue by more than 200 per cent.
WFS reported 1.72 billion euros in revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of 232 million euros for the year ended March 2022.
Founded in 1984, WFS is the world's largest air cargo logistics provider and a leading provider of ground handling and technical services. It has more than 300 customers and employs 32,300 staff, the company said.

Singapore and Laos to strengthen cooperation ahead of 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-and-laos-strengthen-cooperation-ahead-50th-anniversary-diplomatic-relations-2970736,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and Laos will strengthen cooperation in various areas including sustainability and environmental protection as well as urban planning and logistics, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (Sep 28). 
He was delivering a toast speech at an official lunch held in honour of his Laotian counterpart Mr Phankham Viphavanh, who is in Singapore on an official visit.
The Laos prime minister's visit comes ahead of a key milestone in 2024, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Singapore and Laos diplomatic ties. 
Mr Lee shared that the two countries have signed an agreement on energy cooperation and have also renewed an existing agreement on environmental protection, climate change, and water resource management.
This will facilitate mutual exchange of knowledge and expertise and create green growth opportunities for both countries' businesses, he said.
These agreements will strengthen bilateral cooperation on energy further, he added. 
In June, Singapore started importing renewable energy from Laos through Thailand and Malaysia under a two-year power purchase agreement was signed between Keppel Electric and Laos' state-owned Electricite du Laos (EDL).
Under this project, Singapore will import up to 100 megawatts of renewable hydropower from Laos - enough to power about 144,000 four-room HDB flats for a year.

Beyond energy cooperation, Mr Lee said the two countries can also do much more together in many other areas including urban planning and logistics. 
Mr Lee also pledged support for Laos, with the country set to assume the chair of ASEAN in 2024. He said an enhanced cooperation package that will include capacity building programmes geared towards supporting Laos' ASEAN chairmanship will also be implemented."
"SportSG suspends support for Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim, Teong Tzen Wei for a month after drug-related offences","An internal review found Commonwealth Games silver medallist Teong to be the third national swimmer known to have consumed controlled drugs overseas.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/joseph-schooling-amanda-lim-teong-tzen-wei-drugs-sportsg-cnb-2970751,"SINGAPORE: Sport Singapore on Wednesday (Sep 28) said that it will suspend all support for national swimmers Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim and Teong Tzen Wei for a month after they confessed to consuming controlled drugs overseas.
For a month beginning from Oct 1, the three carded athletes under the high performance scheme will not receive training assistance grants or have access to sports science and sports medicine facilities and services, SportSG said in a statement after it concluded an internal review.
SportSG named Teong for the first time on Wednesday as the third swimmer who was investigated for drug-related offences. 
Teong broke the SEA Games 50m freestyle record in May 2022 - his time of 21.93 made him the first Southeast Asian swimmer to go below 22 seconds. He is also Asia's second fastest in the event this year.
Teong also won silver in the men’s 50m butterfly final at the Commonwealth Games.
SportSG noted that the athletes had tested negative for controlled drugs while under investigation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) for drug-related offences, but admitted to drug use while being TeamSG athletes. 
Given Schooling's abuse of disruption privileges, MINDEF had said earlier that he will no longer be eligible for leave or disruption to train or compete while in National Service.
Lim was given a stern warning by CNB under the Misuse of Drugs Act for possessing a drug utensil.
Schooling and Lim both issued apologies in August.
It is illegal for Singaporeans and permanent residents to consume cannabis, whether in Singapore or overseas. The substance is also on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned in-competition drugs.
In response to CNA's queries, a spokesperson from the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) said that its disciplinary proceedings are still ongoing.
""The disciplinary committee will meet with the involved athletes soon and is projected to complete its findings in the next week,"" SNOC said.
""A decision with regards to the prize money will be determined after the disciplinary proceedings are completed.""

In considering the appropriate steps to take, SportSG said that it met with the athletes and conducted an internal review, which concluded last week.
Schooling, Lim and Teong have been issued with letters of warning, it added.
SportSG said that the action taken against them ""underscore their responsibility and accountability as national athletes"".
It added that a range of factors were taken into account, including CNB's findings. 
""All three athletes cooperated fully throughout the internal review process, and readily admitted to the consumption,"" SportSG noted.
""They had expressed remorse for their lapses in judgment, and have appealed to be given a second chance to prove themselves and fulfil their roles and responsibilities as national athletes.""
Schooling, Lim and Teong have resolved to avoid controlled drugs in the future, and are ""committed to making amends by contributing back to the sporting community and play a part in education and other efforts to prevent others from making the same mistake"".
""SportSG will continue to support all three athletes after the period of suspension, in both their sporting endeavours as well as their continued rehabilitation from this episode.""
The Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) said in a statement that as part of their suspension, the three swimmers will not be able to train at the National Aquatics Centre or have access to any facilities, benefits or services accorded to high-performance athletes during this period.
However SSA added that it will continue to support Schooling, Lim and Teong after their suspension.
While the association has a zero-tolerance stance on the use of controlled drugs, the swimmers should not be ostracised from the community for their mistakes, SSA president Mark Chay said.
“The three swimmers have realised their mistakes and are remorseful for their actions,” said Mr Chay. 
“They will face the consequences for their actions. More importantly, the association is taking steps for us, as a swimming community, to come together and help our own get back on their feet.

The Big Read: Pressures and temptations aplenty in sporting world, only a rare few can scale the peak and stay there"
"More than 240 domains associated with illegal streaming sites blocked in Singapore, says Asia Pacific video industry trade association",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/domains-blocked-illegal-streaming-sites-court-asia-video-industry-association-coalition-piracy-2970451,"SINGAPORE: A total of 245 domains associated with 30 illegal streaming sites that provided pirated content including premium sports and drama are now blocked in Singapore, the Asia Video Industry Association’s Coalition Against Piracy (CAP) said on Wednesday (Sep 28) in response to CNA's queries.
This comes after the coalition said in a statement last Tuesday that Internet service providers in Singapore have blocked 99 more domain names associated with those sites.
The latest block was made on the behalf of CAP members, BBC Studios, Discovery Communications, LaLiga, the Premier League and TVB International, said CAP.
The High Court of Singapore first granted an order in February to block the 30 illegal streaming sites and almost 150 associated domains.
The block effectively negates efforts by the illegal sites to circumvent the original order by blocking associated domains the sites would redirect to, said CAP. This also continues its ongoing campaign in Singapore and around the region against online piracy.
In an order provided by CAP, domains related to several illegal online stream sites such as SportsBay, WatchSeries, DramaCool and 123Movies were blocked. 
Some of the domain names that were blocked included:
sportsbay. es
watchseries.ninja
123movies.as
Another domain name, kissasian.fan, linked to the site KissAsian was also blocked.
When accessed by CNA, sportsbay. org was not accessible. Instead, a notice on the site stated: ""Access to the website has been blocked pursuant to an Order of the High Court of Singapore.""
CAP's General Manager Matthew Cheetham said: ""This latest block once again shows the impact of an efficient and effective site blocking regime in combatting illegal streaming sites.""
According to a recent study on online content viewing behaviour in Singapore, site blocking changes consumer behaviour, said CAP. The study was commissioned by the coalition and conducted by YouGov. 
CAP said more than one-third of Singaporean consumers reported that they are spending more time watching free streaming services because of piracy streaming services being blocked by the government. More than 20 per cent said they have subscribed to legitimate services as a result of site blocking.
“Tools such as site blocking, when used efficiently and effectively, are very powerful in combatting online piracy and countering the damage and harm it causes,” added Mr Cheetham.
In an earlier statement in March, CAP said the order was obtained by its members, BBC Studios, Discovery Communications, LaLiga, the Premier League, and TVB International against illegal streaming sites that were offering access to content including premium sports and drama. 
""The order covered the greatest number of sites and domains yet sought by CAP members. Under the order, Internet service providers must disable access to these illegal sites and their associated domains,"" it said. 
However, site blocking is only one part of the coalition's strategy to combat online piracy in Singapore and around the region, it added. 
“In addition to blocking, it’s vital that all players in the content ecosystem work together to combat online piracy,"" said Mr Cheetham. 
""We are pleased to see this gathering momentum around the region from industry players, governments, and intermediaries to recognise that piracy is incredibly damaging to industry and economies, and very harmful to consumers."""
What we know about the false bomb threat on Singapore Airlines flight SQ33,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-airlines-bomb-threat-sq33-what-we-know-2970376,"SINGAPORE: On Wednesday (Sep 28), the Singapore Police Force (SPF) was informed of a bomb threat on board Singapore Airlines flight SQ33, travelling from San Francisco to Singapore.
A passenger was reported to have assaulted a cabin crew member, claiming he had a bomb in his carry-on bag. He was restrained and the plane was escorted by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter jets to Changi Airport, where it landed safely.
The threat was subsequently verified to be false and investigations are ongoing.
Here's a timeline of what happened:
Sep 26, 10.05pm (Pacific Daylight Time)/Sep 27, 1.05pm (Singapore time)
Flight SQ33 takes off from San Francisco at 10.05pm on Monday, beginning its 16-hour flight to Singapore.
The Airbus A350-941 that SIA uses on this route has a capacity of 253 passengers.
Sep 28, 2.40am (Singapore time)
More than 12 hours after take-off, the Singapore police are alerted to an alleged bomb threat on board the flight.
According to Singapore Airlines, an ""unruly"" passenger allegedly hit a cabin crew member. 
The 37-year-old passenger also allegedly claimed there was a bomb in a carry-on bag. He is restrained by the crew, said police.
Sep 28, 4.30am
According to Flightradar24 data, the plane begins its descent while circling over the South China Sea, making three loops before continuing its route, Flightradar24 shows. It goes from an altitude of about 40,000 feet (12,192m) to about 10,175 feet (3,101m).
Sep 28, 5.42am
The plane circles over Batam Island, flying to about 1,800 feet (548.64m) before making its descent towards Singapore.
Sep 28, 5.51am
The plane lands safely at Changi Airport under the escort of RSAF F16C/D fighter jets. 
The aircraft is taxied to a remote bay on arrival at Changi Airport for security checks and the passenger is handed over to the police.
Teams from The Singapore Army’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group and the Airport Police Division look into the claims. The threat is subsequently verified to be false.
The man is arrested for making false threats of terrorist acts and for suspected consumption of controlled drugs.
The aircraft is towed to Changi Airport Terminal 3 after the security checks are completed.
Sep 28, 9.20am
All passengers and crew disembark.
Sep 29
The man is charged with an offence of using threatening words likely to cause alarm, as well as an offence of voluntarily causing hurt. 
Preliminary investigations showed that he had allegedly shouted that there was a bomb on the plane during the flight. He also grabbed another passenger's luggage from the cabin's overhead compartment and assaulted a member of the cabin crew who tried to intervene and restrain him.
The man's urine also tested positive for controlled drugs, according to investigations by the Central Narcotics Bureau.

"Weekly dengue cases fall below 600 in September, but continued vigilance is critical: NEA","This year saw a resurgence of dengue cases in February, earlier than the traditional peak season of June to October. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/weekly-dengue-cases-fall-below-600-september-high-may-aedes-mosquito-2970276,"SINGAPORE: Weekly reported numbers of dengue cases have fallen from a high of 1,568 in May to fewer than 600 in September, but continued vigilance is critical as cases may remain high beyond the traditional peak dengue season, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a media factsheet released in tandem with its annual report on Wednesday (Sep 28). 
The number of dengue clusters has also declined by about 62 per cent from the high of 422 clusters in June, according to numbers from the NEA. This is despite an earlier resurgence of more than 200 weekly cases in February.  
The NEA on Wednesday released its Integrated Sustainability Report 2021/2022, which provides an account of the agency's corporate, financial and sustainability performance in Financial Year 2021 and also documents NEA’s activities, achievements and financial performance.
Among this was an overview of the dengue situation, which traditionally peaks between June to October but saw signs of an outbreak earlier this year. 
The report cited several factors for the resurgence, including the waning of cross-protective immunity arising from past cases, the larger mosquito population and the circulation of the less common Dengue 3 virus serotype. 
The Singapore population is susceptible to a large dengue outbreak due to its low immunity towards dengue. NEA's CEO Luke Goh said: ""Despite a significant decrease in dengue cases in 2021, there was a resurgence of cases at the start of 2022 signalling early signs of an outbreak. NEA and our partners rapidly strengthened vector control measures in tandem with the steady expansion of Project Wolbachia to bring the wave of cases under control.""

Almost 5,500 dengue cases reported in Singapore so far this year, exceeding last year's total 













To combat the resurgence, NEA brought forward the launch of the National Dengue Prevention Campaign, where the new purple community alert banners were launched as part of the colour-coded Dengue Community Alert System to inform residents of the dengue situation in their estate.  
""Responding to early signs of an outbreak, we activated the Inter-agency Dengue Task Force for intensive source reduction efforts in anticipation of a rise in cases,"" said the NEA. 
The alert banners were placed in non-dengue cluster areas with a persistently high Aedes aegypti mosquito population as a visual reminder for residents to take proactive prevention measures to minimise the risk of dengue cluster formation. 
NEA also worked with partner agencies in its outreach efforts and jointly distributed 800,000 bottles of mosquito repellant to students in preschools, primary and secondary schools with Temasek Foundation. 
To complement these efforts, NEA also released more male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes at eight additional field sites since July 2022 under Project Wolbachia.
Under the project, male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will mate with females, causing them to lay eggs that do not hatch, thus reducing the dengue mosquito population.
As part of enforcement efforts, the NEA conducted around 409,000 inspections across Singapore in the first half of 2022, including 2,800 inspections at construction sites. In the same period, the NEA issued fines to 1,300 households for mosquito breeding, and 6,565 legal notices to homeowners and occupiers. 
The authority also issued 70 Stop Work Orders to construction sites and charged 28 contractors in court. Around 11,300 mosquito breeding habitats were detected in the first half of 2022, across all types of premises. 
The NEA said: ""Despite the unusual early rise in dengue cases this year, the collective efforts of stakeholders and the community have allowed us to manage the outbreak, without reaching the peak dengue case numbers seen in the huge 2020 outbreak. However continued vigilance is critical, as weekly dengue cases remain high and could continue to remain high beyond the traditional peak dengue season.
""NEA therefore urges all stakeholders to sustain dengue prevention measures, to bring down dengue case numbers further.""

How have BTO flats in prime areas fared since their launch?,"The Prime Location Public Housing model will help prevent central areas from becoming exclusive neighbourhoods that only the well-to-do can enjoy in private housing, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/prime-locations-hdb-flats-plh-demand-application-rates-2968296,"SINGAPORE: Since the first launch in November last year, application rates for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in prime areas have slowed. 
There have been five developments under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model, which will see Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats built in central regions.
On Sunday (Sep 25), Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said the PLH model was launched to ensure that central areas do not become “exclusive neighbourhoods that only the well-to-do can enjoy in private housing”.
Singapore risks gentrification and stratification if it leaves public housing to market forces, he added.
CNA spoke to experts to find out how the PLH flats have fared since they were launched.





      How the Prime Location Housing model works
  

Currently, the BTO projects under the PLH model are located at Bukit Merah, Queenstown, Kallang Whampoa and Rochor. 
The eligibility conditions for buying BTO flats in prime areas from HDB will be the same as prevailing conditions for BTO flats.
Such flats come with a minimum occupation period (MOP) of 10 years – this means the unit cannot be sold on the open market before that. The usual MOP is five years.
Although these units are priced with additional subsidies, given their higher market values, future owners of such flats will have to pay a percentage of the unit’s resale price to HDB.
Flat owners can also only sell to resale buyers who meet the prevailing BTO eligibility criteria, such as the income ceiling. After the MOP, they are also not allowed to rent out the whole unit.

DEMAND FOR PLH FLATS
Application rates for PLH flat fell in the last BTO exercise in August. According to data from HDB, there were 967 applicants for 353 three-room units in Bukit Merah that came under the PLH model. That means there were about 2.7 applicants per unit.
For the four-room units, there were 7,916 applicants for 1,298 units, which comes up to an application rate of 6.1. That was far lower than the rates for other units in mature estates in the same BTO exercise. 
With strong demand for larger units, the four-room and five-room/three-generation units in Ang Mo Kio drew application rates of 12.6 and 17.5 respectively.
Four-room units and five-room units in Tampines drew application rates of 22.3 and 26.3 respectively.
The PLH flats opened to high demand in the first BTO exercise that they were available in November 2021.
A four-room unit in Rochor drew an application rate of 10.3. In February, a four-room flat in Kallang Whampoa under the PLH model had an application rate of 17.5.

LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
The slower demand for prime area BTO flats among buyers may be because of the longer wait times, stringent criteria, as well as the distance of the flats from the city centre, said analysts.
Huttons Asia’s senior director for research Lee Sze Teck said the buyers were excited over the first two launches of PLH flats, which were in Rochor and Kallang Whampoa. 
“At the start, buyers had the impression that these will be for prime, central locations like the city centre and the Greater Southern Waterfront,” said Mr Lee. 
""When PLH flats started to appear in further locations from the city centre like Ghim Moh, the initial euphoria over PLH flats died down.
“Buyers appeared to be treating PLH flats as any other BTO flat in a mature estate.""
Of all the locations of the BTO flats under the PLH model, only River Peaks I and II in Rochor, as well as King George’s Heights in Kallang Whampoa, can be considered to be in the city centre, he added. 
“The other PLH locations, while good, are just simply in a mature estate,"" Mr Lee said, adding that newer resale flats without PLH restrictions in the same neighbourhoods are ""more appealing"" than the PLH flats.
How far the flats are from the city centre has a ""negative correlation"" with applications.
""The further from the city centre, the lower the applications,” said Mr Lee.
Besides location, buyers may also be put off by the longer wait times that come with prime area BTO flats, said Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex.
“Combined with the 10-year minimum occupation period and certain resale and leasing restrictions, it is possible that some applicants could have decided not to apply for the PLH projects,” she said.
Applicants may think they are “locked in” for a substantial period of time, which may be at least 15 years, given the MOP and construction time, Ms Wong added.
This could potentially impact their future property upgrading plans or accommodate for changes in lifestyle or needs later on in life.
Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee and Tie said some buyers may be deterred by the more stringent selling criteria for PLH flats, as well as the clawback of the future sales proceeds to recover the subsidies given.
The pool of buyers may have shrunk – eligible and interested buyers may have already made purchases in earlier BTO exercises, she added.
Potential home applicants and younger couples looking for a shorter wait for their flats may have also turned their attention to the other flats that were offered in the August BTO exercise, said Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst at One Global Group. 
“The PLH concept seems to be deterring potential home buyers wanting to reap a quick profit in the short-term and hoping to join the 'millionaire HDB resale club',"" Mr Mohan added.

DEMAND REMAINS DECENT
Despite the lower application rates, analysts expect demand for BTO flats offered under the PLH model to remain decent. 
PropNex's Ms Wong said that as the PLH model is a relatively new policy.
""With the Government’s aim of making housing more inclusive and affordable for Singaporean households, we would expect HDB to continue to offer PLH projects,"" she added.
""We anticipate the demand for PLH projects to remain decent, supported by families who wish to live closer to the city.""
Head of research at 99.co Pow Ying Khuan said buyers who prefer living in a particular prime location for the long term will be the target profile for these PLH flats. 
""The regulations and criteria set for PLH flats restrict the buyer pool by nature and by design,"" he added.
""Hence, the relatively low application rates are not necessarily a bad thing as its implementation is to make owning public flats in prime locations more accessible for genuine owner-occupiers.""
Ms Sun said there will always be demand for PLH flats given their locations and ""lack of supply of housing"" in Singapore.
""The good sales take-up of previous projects indicates that many Singaporeans do not mind the stringent selling criteria and longer MOP of PLH model flats,” she added. 
The clawback of subsidies and stringent selling criteria may also help to moderate the flats’ future resale prices to some extent, said Ms Sun. This will help to ensure that people who purchase PLH flats in certain mature estates are buying for their own occupation and not for investment purposes.
Buyers can also expect the continuous placement of BTO developments under the PLH model to become the norm moving forward, said Mr Mohan.
The PLH model is an important step towards a more inclusive society, said Mr Pow. It prevents gentrification in prime areas, where it is becoming exclusive to the wealthy, he added.
""We believe that the long-term plan for the PLH model is to introduce more eligible Singaporean households to live in the central locations of Singapore so as to eliminate economic enclaves and level up the playing fields,"" he said."
"Weakened pound good news for holidaymakers, but many taking wait-and-see approach, say money changers",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/british-pound-money-changer-travel-2968376,"SINGAPORE: The value of the pound fell to a record low against the dollar on Monday (Sep 26), tumbling nearly 5 per cent at one point to US$1.04. 
That was triggered by the British government’s new plan to slash taxes and provide handouts to help families cope with soaring household energy bills. 
Paying for that will require the government to borrow billions of pounds, deepening anxiety about Britain’s public finances at home and abroad. 
Against the Singapore dollar, the pound sank about 2.7 per cent on Monday, hovering around S$1.50. By Tuesday, the pound bounced back to S$1.55, helped by the Bank of England promising to monitor markets and take action if necessary. 
Analysts say the pound will remain volatile this week as markets wait to see how policymakers in the UK respond to the loss of confidence in the pound. 
Some money changers CNA spoke to said people seemed to be taking advantage of the weak pound, with online money changer Thin Margin already seeing a higher demand for the currency.
“It is the best time for holidaymakers to travel to Europe,” said CEO Nabeel Ghaffar. 
“The stronger Singdollar has improved demand not only for money changing, but money transfer too,” Mr Nabeel added. 
He said individuals and businesses may take advantage of the weak pound to buy property, make investments and pay salaries for remote workers. 
The weak pound means the Singapore dollar buys more of the pound, which is good news for holidaymakers.  
Mr Jalal, who runs AR Money Exchange at Junction 8 in Bishan said he sold at least £10,000 on Monday and expects to sell just as much, if not more, on Tuesday.  
He said those travelling overseas would take advantage of the weak pound. So would investors, he added. “They buy and keep, and sell back to us,” he explained.

Other money changers CNA spoke to on Tuesday morning said there has not been a significant uptick in demand for the pound. 
At The Arcade at Raffles Place, home to a cluster of money changers, lines had yet to form at around 10am.
The owner of Shara Exchange, who gave his name as Mr Saleem, noted that while there were people buying the pound on Monday, many are likely to be holding out for better rates.
""There were not many transactions taking place ... People may think (the pound) will go down, so they are still waiting. Yesterday, it went down and today it went up a bit - it's fluctuating. So, people still may monitor,"" he said.
Most money changers that CNA spoke to also observed that those who bought the pound were mainly Singaporeans, and that sales could not compare to that of the Japanese yen, which dropped significantly last week.
Demand was so strong that the yen was sold out by about 12.30pm last Saturday, said one trader.
""The pound is unstable now as it is slow-moving, so we see more Singaporeans buying the Japanese yen because the rate is good,"" said Mr Abdul Hamid, 50, an employee at MIJ Money Changer.
Besides money changers, the weak pound may also translate into more business for travel agencies. 
Luxury travel agency Lightfoot Travel said it has already “felt a jump in enquiries over the weekend”, driven by the pound and the reopening of Hong Kong, one of the agency’s key markets. 
“The exchange rates can really affect the way our guests travel from Asia,” the agency’s COO and co-founder Lucy Jackson Walsh said. 
“The trend of taking advantage of exchange rates will only increase travel to the UK for all of Lightfoot’s markets – from Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore,” Ms Walsh added. 
“With Hong Kong opening up and the weakening pound, we anticipate a strong surge in bookings,” she told CNA. 
Travel agency EU Holidays is also expecting travellers to take advantage of the weak pound to travel to the UK.
""Any country with a better exchange rate will definitely draw Singaporeans to visit because they feel that it is a 'bargain' to travel ... right now,"" he said, adding that Singaporeans were already engaging in ""revenge travelling"", a phrase used to describe the pent-up post-pandemic demand. 
Another agency L.G.E Travel said that while its packages are mostly for travel to Europe, there have been ""lots of individual requests from travellers asking (to) stopover in the UK"". 
A spokesperson for the agency said it is anticipating future demand not only from holidaymakers but for business travellers as well.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vapes-e-vaporisers-people-caught-using-possessing-2022-hsa-cases-increasing-2968421,"SINGAPORE: A total of 3,912 people have been caught using and possessing e-vaporisers or vapes between January and August this year as the number of cases continues to rise annually. 
In 2021, 4,697 people were caught for the same offence, more than triple the figure of 1,266 in the previous year.
In 2019, the number stood at 811.
Providing an update on Tuesday (Sep 27), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said 428 people have been caught selling vapes from 2018 to August 2022. A total of 91 were prosecuted in the same period. 
Although the use, purchase and possession of e-vaporisers were banned in Singapore from February 2018, such products continue to be sold online and smuggled into the country.
""HSA works closely with our partner agencies to stem the flow of e-vaporisers smuggled through the checkpoints and via online orders,"" said the agency.
It added that it monitors social media platforms and messaging apps for anyone suspected of selling vapes, refill liquids and cartridges. 
""We work with related e-commerce sites to shut down such listings promptly upon detection. To complement our enforcement operations, HSA has also collaborated with online platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Carousell ... to remove illegal postings on tobacco-related products,"" said HSA.
In 2021, more than 6,800 postings were removed.

HSA said Singapore adopts a multipronged approach to tackle the use of e-vaporisers, comprising legislation, enforcement, public education and counselling.
In May, illegal vape products estimated to be worth more than S$1 million were burned at the Tuas South Incineration Plant as part of the HSA's enforcement operations. This included an estimated 6,500 e-vaporisers, 83,500 pods and 8,000 e-liquids.
On Monday, HSA said 17 people were convicted for selling vapes between February and August this year, with total fines amounting to S$114,500. Five people were also given jail sentences ranging from 10 to 26 days.
Authorities are also working to address the issue of teenagers getting hooked on vaping. 
A student health adviser told CNA in June that some students who vape have the misconception that it is a healthier substitute for smoking.
To tackle the issue, HSA said it works with the Ministry of Health, the Health Promotion Board and the Ministry of Education “through targeted education and enforcement strategies for youth”.
Offenders found to be selling, possessing for sale, importing or distributing e-vaporisers can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both for the first offence. 
Repeat offenders could be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both."

Singapore's population increases 3.4% after two years of decline
Singapore's total population grew by 3.4 per cent to 5.64 million as of June this year, after two straight years of decline, according to the National Population and Talent Division on Tuesday (Sep 27). Despite the growth, the total population in Singapore remained slightly lower than the pre-COVID level of 5.7 million as of June 2019.
Citizen marriages in 2021 saw an increase, with Singapore also seeing its resident fertility rate recovering slightly from a historic low in 2020. The National Population and Talent Division said that the increase in marriages in 2021 was due in part to the progressive easing of COVID-19 safe management measures.
Last year also saw 21,537 people granted citizenship and 33,435 granted permanent residence. These figures were higher compared with 2020, due to the easing of travel restrictions and safe management measures.
The report added that Singapore's population is ageing rapidly. By 2030, about one in four citizens will be aged 65 and above. The number of citizens aged 80 and above has also increased by more than 70 per cent from 2012.
With flowers and a gun salute, Japan bids farewell to slain Abe at state funeral
Japan honoured slain former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday (Sep 27) at the first state funeral for a former premier in 55 years. About 4,300 people attended the funeral ceremony itself, along with at least 48 current or former government figures, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Outside the funeral venue, thousands of Japanese people stood in line as the ashes arrived, waiting to deliver flowers and say a prayer in two mourning tents.
The decision to give Abe a state funeral - only the second for a former prime minister in the post-war period - provoked opposition, with about 60 per cent of Japanese against the event in recent polls. Some lawmakers from opposition parties boycotted the funeral altogether.
Bloomberg Opinion’s Gearoid Reidy says a partisan debate over the state funeral embarrasses Japan on the world stage.
Vietnam braces for Typhoon Noru as Philippines cleans up in its wake
Vietnam urged more people on Tuesday (Sep 27) to evacuate as an intensifying Typhoon Noru barrelled towards the southeast Asian nation, after causing at least eight deaths and widespread flooding in the Philippines.
Vietnam's meteorological agency said Noru was expected to make landfall in Vietnam on Wednesday before weakening and moving on to Thailand.
Vietnam's aviation authority closed nine airports across the country from Tuesday, forcing hundreds of domestic and international flights to be cancelled. Around 270,000 military personnel have been placed on standby.

Dozens of people took part in a rare protest in Chinese tech hub Shenzhen after officials announced a snap lockdown over a handful of COVID-19 cases.
At least 14 ""high-risk areas"" across three districts were under lockdown on Tuesday (Sep 27), with residents forced to stay in their homes. Another 15 neighbourhoods were marked as medium-risk, with residents only allowed to walk inside their housing compounds.
Videos circulating on Weibo and Instagram since Monday - verified by AFP - showed dozens chanting ""lift the COVID lockdown"" as rows of police in medical protective gear look on.

Southeast Asia's first helicopter running on sustainable aviation fuel takes flight in Singapore,"Demo flights such as these show that sustainable aviation fuel is available and safe to use, said the producer of the cleaner alternative. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sustainable-aviation-fuel-bell-neste-helicopter-greenhouse-emissions-2968451,"SINGAPORE: A helicopter running on sustainable aviation fuel – used cooking oil and animal fats mixed with jet fuel – took flight in Singapore on Monday (Sep 26), becoming the first chopper in Southeast Asia to do so.
The trip marked the start of greener test flights for buyers in Asia by helicopter manufacturer Bell, as it looks to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
A single trip on the greener fuel supplied by renewable fuels maker Neste is expected to cut the helicopter’s emissions by about 30 per cent.
""So far, the feedback has been really good. We're seeing the same performance and I think customers are satisfied that we're taking steps right to reduce greenhouse emissions,” Bell’s managing director for Asia Pacific Jacinto Monge told CNA.
















Such demonstrations play the important role of bringing the aviation industry on board the sustainability drive, said Neste’s Sami Jauhiainen. They also show that sustainable aviation fuel is available and safe to use, despite the adoption of greener fuel being in very early phases in the Asia Pacific.
“General aviation and helicopter use - these represent the kind of segments of the aviation market that are well positioned to be the front runners and show examples of the broader industry,” said the firm’s vice-president for Renewable Aviation in Asia Pacific.
TOWARDS GREENER SKIES
The move to incorporate more sustainable aviation fuel comes as the industry makes its journey towards greener skies.
Since July, Singapore Airlines and Scoot have been offering flights running on sustainable aviation fuel with a premium in a year-long trial.
The helicopter flight on Monday came days after an international panel of experts recommended ways for Singapore to achieve its aspirations as a sustainable aviation hub.
Among the 15 recommendations to the Government are stimulating demand and supply for sustainable aviation fuel and allowing planes to take the most optimal route between destinations to increase fuel efficiency.
The recommendations encourage - in the short term - corporate buyers coming together to fund sustainable aviation fuel use, as well as longer term structural and more policy-driven measures that are needed to create a long term growing market for green fuel, said Mr Jauhiainen.
COST REMAINS A CHALLENGE
However, cost remains a key challenge, Mr Jauhiainen said, even as his firm prepares to expand its Singapore refinery next year to increase its production capacity to a million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel is about three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

Commentary: Is sustainable fuel a chance for 'dirty' flight industry to decarbonise?













While there are “significant” efficiencies of scale in ramping up production, Mr Jauhiainen does not expect the cleaner alternative to be cost-competitive.
“We do expect that the premium will be there and hence we will need policy frameworks that enable ultimately that cost premium to be transferred ultimately to the ticket prices and be paid by aviation’s end customers in the end,” he said.
He added that another challenge is the need for global alignment on standards and requirements that verify the sustainability of green fuel while providing enough visibility for investors in sustainable aviation fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel, which makes up less than 1 per cent of the global jet fuel demand, is an easy and quick adoption solution to greening the sector in the short to medium term, noted Ms Mabel Kwan, managing director of Alton Aviation Consultancy.
However, as technology evolves, more alternatives to decarbonise the aviation industry are expected, she said.
“The new novel technologies in terms of other new energy sources such as hydrogen, and eventually electrical aircraft, that's something that the industry will be able to develop in the longer run on a commercial scale,” she said."
SLA director becomes first Singaporean to lead UN geospatial expert group,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/victor-khoo-first-singaporean-appointed-co-chair-lead-un-geospatial-expert-community-2968416,"SINGAPORE: A director at the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has become the first Singaporean to be appointed as co-chair of the United Nations Expert Group on Land Administration and Management.
Dr Victor Khoo, director of survey and geomatics at SLA, will assume the position for three years starting from August, the authority said in a press release on Tuesday (Sep 27). 
Founded in 2015, the UN Expert Group is represented by geospatial professionals from more than 28 countries across Europe, South America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. 
Geospatial data is directly linked to specific geographical locations and is usually portrayed on a map. 
The SLA has encouraged adoption of geospatial technologies as part of Singapore's Smart Nation drive.
The statutory board said Dr Khoo's appointment was ""strong recognition"" of Singapore's achievements in land registration and management and digitalisation of land ownership.
""The appointment also places Singapore at the centre of global geospatial policymaking, and further positions Singapore as a global hub for geospatial innovation and economic activities,"" said SLA.
















As countries work to stave off the impact of climate change, location data obtained through mapping has also proven to be critical in solving such issues. 
Dr Khoo and the Singapore team will share with the UN Expert Group Singapore's experience in 3D mapping of the environment to produce high-resolution geospatial data and 3D city models, said SLA.
These will span initiatives in coastal protection, solar panels deployment and greening. 
""Geospatial technology ... Can help address some of the most pressing climate change issues such as rising sea-levels and coastal damage,"" said Dr Khoo. 
SLA chief executive Colin Low said investing in geospatial capabilities has ""brought social and economic benefits to Singaporeans and (their) businesses"". 
SLA said it would continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with the international community, in driving the adoption of geospatial technology to mitigate the impact of climate change."
Singapore's population increases 3.4% after two years of decline,"The number of citizen marriages rose 20.6 per cent, while the resident fertility rate recovered slightly from a historic low.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-population-increase-two-year-decline-marriages-birth-rate-2968081,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's total population grew by 3.4 per cent to 5.64 million as of June this year, after two straight years of decline, according to an annual report by the National Population and Talent Division on Tuesday (Sep 27).
Despite the growth, the total population in Singapore remained slightly lower than the pre-COVID level of 5.7 million as of June 2019.
The total population growth rate over the past five years, from 2017 to 2022, was slower compared with the preceding five-year period. 
Excluding the effects of COVID-19 from June 2019 to June 2021, the compound annual growth rate for the total population between June 2017 and June 2019 was 0.8 per cent. This was already lower than the compound annual growth rate of 1.1 per cent between June 2012 and June 2017, said the report.
Singapore's resident population, which comprises citizens and permanent residents, totalled 4.07 million, an increase from 3.99 million in June 2021. There were 1.56 million non-residents as of June.
The increase in resident population was mainly due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, as more residents who previously remained overseas continuously for 12 months or more returned to Singapore.
The citizen population increased by 1.6 per cent from 3.5 million in June 2021 to 3.55 million in June this year.
The non-resident population grew by 6.6 per cent from June last year – mainly due to a recovery in foreign employment levels in Singapore after the easing of travel restrictions – but it remained below the pre-COVID level of 1.68 million in June 2019.
The largest increase was seen for work permit holders in the construction, marine shipyard, and process sectors.











MARRIAGES AND BIRTH RATES
Singapore saw an increase in citizen marriages in 2021, with the country also seeing its resident fertility rate recovering slightly from a historic low in 2020.
There were 23,433 citizen marriages last year, a 20.6 per cent increase from 2020. This figure was also higher than the number of marriages in 2019, which saw 22,165 marriages. 
The National Population and Talent Division said that the increase in marriages in 2021 was due in part to the progressive easing of COVID-19 safe management measures.
There were 31,713 citizen births in 2021, a slight decrease from 31,816 citizen births in 2020.
The resident total fertility rate recovered slightly from 1.10 in 2020 to 1.12 in 2021. The resident fertility rate has generally been declining for the past few decades, largely due to the rising proportion of singles, later marriages, and married couples having fewer children, said the report.
This fertility rate was still lower than the pre-COVID level of 1.14 in 2019.

IMMIGRATION
Last year, 21,537 people were granted citizenship and 33,435 were granted permanent residence. About 6 per cent of new Singapore citizens were children born overseas to Singaporean parents. 
These figures were higher compared with 2020, due to the easing of travel restrictions and safe management measures, which previously slowed down the processes for the grant of citizenship or permanent residence in 2020. Such processes had to be completed in person.
""Immigration helps to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates on our citizen population, and keeps it from shrinking over the longer term,"" said the report.
""Singapore grants new citizenships annually to individuals who can integrate and contribute to Singapore, and are committed to making Singapore their home. New citizens either share family ties with Singaporeans (for example, through marriage), or have studied, worked or lived in Singapore for some time.
""All new adult citizens come from our pool of PRs, as individuals have to obtain permanent residence before they may apply for citizenship in Singapore.""
AGEING POPULATION
Singapore's population is ageing rapidly, with low fertility rates and longer life expectancies, said the report.
The proportion of citizens aged 65 and above has increased from 11.1 per cent in 2012 to 18.4 per cent in 2022. By 2030, about one in four citizens, or 23.8 per cent, will be aged 65  and above.
The number of citizens aged 80 and above has also increased by more than 70 per cent from 2012.
""As a small city state that relies on people as our key resource, the ageing trend and its implications will hit us even more acutely. It is important that we strengthen our whole-of-society efforts to address this core demographic challenge,"" said the report."
"Man jailed for assaulting wife, fighting with passer-by over 'Guan Yin Ma sighting'",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-assault-wife-guan-yin-ma-fighting-court-2968251,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to jail on Tuesday (Sep 27) for an assortment of hurt charges including punching his wife, throwing hot water on her and fighting with a passer-by over a purported sighting of ""Guan Yin Ma"" or the Goddess of Mercy.
Philip Ong Guo Xiang, 34, was sentenced to 11 months and two weeks' jail. He pleaded guilty to five charges including voluntarily causing hurt and causing hurt by an act endangering the personal safety of others. Another four charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Ong, a warehouse worker, was with his 34-year-old wife near Block 206, Bedok North Street 1 on Sep 28, 2021.
They were there to buy a handphone screen protector and to meet their ComCare social worker. ComCare is under the Ministry of Social and Family Development and provides social assistance for low-income individuals and families.
Ong and his wife were taking a smoke break outside a social service office when they started taking pictures of the sky, as they had heard there was something resembling ""Guan Yin Ma"", the Buddhist Goddess of mercy, compassion and kindness.
They were discussing what they saw when a passer-by, a 62-year-old food delivery rider, asked them what they were doing. Ong told him that there was supposed to be something in the sky resembling ""Guan Yin Ma"", so the delivery rider also began taking pictures.
However, he failed to see anything that resembled the Goddess of Mercy, the prosecutor said.
About five minutes later, he confronted Ong and alleged that Ong was a scammer. The delivery rider also began taking pictures of Ong and his wife. Ong asked the rider to stop and to delete the pictures, but the rider refused.
He challenged Ong to a fight and threatened to have Ong or his wife beaten up if they stepped foot in Lorong 20, Geylang.
Angered by this, Ong pushed the delivery rider on his chest and kicked his knee. The rider lost his balance and fell against a nearby stone bench.
A woman who was walking by saw what happened and called the police.
THE TRACETOGETHER TOKEN DISPUTE
Ong and his wife got into trouble again in February this year near Bedok Point Shopping Centre. A 37-year-old woman who was with her daughter and husband saw Ong and his wife arguing.
Ong was angry that he had misplaced his TraceTogether token. When his wife tried to calm him down, he picked up a traffic cone and threw it at a nearby pillar. The cone hit the pillar and the 37-year-old woman, striking her arm.
Her husband called the police and paramedics attended to her.
Ong blew up at his wife again in May this year, as he was upset with her for oversleeping after taking some medication. He punched her in the eye, causing it to swell and she could not open her eye.
His wife fell asleep in the living room, but woke up to a burning sensation on her face. Ong had splashed hot liquid at her, upset that she had called him names.
His wife denied it and reminded him that she had been asleep the whole time. Ong then apologised to her.
In another occasion on Jun 2 this year, Ong punched his wife in the head when they were arguing over how to split S$500 that they had received from ComCare. A passer-by reported the incident to the police, and they found Ong's wife with a bloodshot eye and scald injuries on her body from the previous incident.

Dog trainer fails in appeal against animal business ban after deaths of dogs she left in car boot,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dog-trainer-fail-appeal-animal-business-ban-after-deaths-dogs-left-car-boot-2968141,"SINGAPORE: A dog trainer who was disqualified from running any animal-related business for six months because two French bulldogs died in her care has failed in her appeal against the disqualification order.
Sabrina Sim Xin Huey, 30, was fined S$8,000 in June for leaving the dogs in her car boot for one-and-a-half hours as she was distracted by a social media post. 
The dogs, Chocoby and Hunniby, later died from heat stress. Their owners had imported them from Australia to Singapore and hired Sim to train them. 
Sim parked her vehicle at an unsheltered spot in an open-air car park in August 2020 and left the dogs in the boot after turning off the engine and air-conditioning as she was distracted by a social media post. 
As part of the court's sentence, Sim was also banned from running any animal-related business for six months.
However, Sim appealed against the disqualification order, and it was stayed while the appeal was heard.
In a judgment released on Tuesday (Sep 27), Justice Vincent Hoong dismissed Sim's appeal.
Sim had contended that a court ought to impose such disqualification orders only ""in the most serious cases of animal abuse"", when an offender intentionally inflicts harm on an animal.
Justice Hoong rejected this argument. He pointed to the wording of the Animals and Birds Act to say it did not support Sim's argument.
""The court is empowered to impose a disqualification order if a person is convicted of an offence under (various sections) of the Animals and Birds Act, which offences are not limited to intentional acts,"" said the judge.
He pointed to an example of how a person failing to make a reasonable effort to recover a missing animal constitutes an offence.
The judge also rejected the argument that the disqualification order against Sim was unwarranted because the offence was rooted in her negligence.
""The disqualification order also seeks to punish the appellant for her negligence, protect other animals and their owners by disqualifying her from being a person in charge of any animal in the course of her employment with any animal-related business for a period of time and sound a stern warning to other persons that such negligent conduct will attract a significant period of disqualification,"" said the judge.
He rejected the argument that the duration of the order was ""manifestly excessive"", and said the length of the order ""gave adequate weight to the fact that the appellant's negligence led to the death of two dogs"".
Sim had asked for the disqualification order to be backdated ""to treat the disqualification period as 'spent'"", but the judge again rejected this.
""This would render the disqualification order wholly nugatory and undermine the objectives of a disqualification order ... particularly as the appellant continued taking on customers and providing dog training services after the material incident,"" said Justice Hoong."
IMH launches nationwide study to assess state of mental health among young people in Singapore,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-youth-mental-health-study-imh-2968021,"SINGAPORE: The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has launched a nationwide study to identify specific issues, challenges and common psychological problems that affect young people in Singapore.
The National Youth Mental Health Study aims to establish the prevalence of key mental health conditions among young people in Singapore, identify the personal and social factors associated with these conditions and the level of unmet treatment needs. 
IMH researchers will also examine how young people aged 15 to 35 experience major transitions in life, such as moving across various education stages to joining the workforce and starting a family, said the institute in a media release on Tuesday (Sep 27). 
“This is to assess the impact on mental health and identify risk and protective factors of adverse mental health outcomes that are unique to these stages,” IMH said. 
About 2,600 people aged from 15 to 35 years old will be interviewed for the study. 
Respondents will complete a set of questionnaires that will collect information on their socio-demographic background and information related to mental health, feelings, experiences in school or the workplace, social support, and lifestyle behaviours.
The study will focus on a wide range of ""youth-centric aspects and behaviours"" that are linked to mental health and well-being such as bullying, self-harm, alcohol use, smoking, social media use, smartphone addiction, burnout, academic stress, insomnia, resilience, body image and self-esteem.
It will also gather views on how satisfied young people are with their living environment, for instance, the level of trust in the Government, a sense of safety in their neighbourhood and social inclusivity. 
The collection of data for the study will begin in October and continue until June next year. The data will be analysed and the results are expected to be ready by the end of 2024, said IMH.
HIGHEST PROPORTION OF MENTAL DISORDERS
The Singapore Mental Health Study in 2010 and 2016 focused largely on the adult population in Singapore. 
Findings from both studies showed that young people aged 18 to 34 had the highest proportion of mental disorders and were more vulnerable to developing mood and anxiety disorders, said Dr Mythily Subramaniam, assistant chairman of the medical board for research at IMH. 
About 21.6 per cent of youths in Singapore have also experienced at least one mental health condition, she added.
The youth mental health study will give researchers an opportunity to intervene early to support people and to design appropriate mental health promotion measures. 
""This study will also allow us to better understand how young people seek help, which may be different from the general population, to better allocate relevant resources,"" said Dr Mythily.
""Since this is the first time we are conducting a study of this magnitude on this population, the data will also serve as a baseline for tracking future trends and changes in youth mental health in Singapore.""
The study is funded by the Ministry of Health and is led by Dr Swapna Verma, chairman of the medical board at IMH and Dr Mythily. They will work with national youth mental health outreach and assessment service CHAT and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.

More youths seeking help with mental health - but finding it isn’t always easy













The study will look at risk factors and protective factors, such as resilience and social support for those aged 15 to 35.
Dr Swapna said: ""Our emphasis is on the transitional phases in a young person’s life. We know that mental health is affected as we experience transitions in life.
""For young people, this may be more pronounced because they go through several major life changes in a relatively short period of time – for example, moving from school to tertiary education or National Service, or starting their first job and taking on more responsibilities.""
These changes also take place against a more challenging backdrop of global upheavals such as the COVID-19 pandemic, wars and climate change, she added.
The study will also reach out to young people who are not in education or training as there is not much insight on this group's mental health needs, said Dr Swapna.
""With the surge in psychosocial challenges faced by today’s youth, there is a need to identify immediate priorities and take appropriate steps to improve their mental well-being,"" she said."
"Man fined for sending then-wife's intimate photos to friend, claiming they were 'open-minded'",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-fined-sending-intimate-photos-wife-friend-open-minded-marriage-court-crime-2968036,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$3,500 by a court on Tuesday (Sep 27) for sending intimate photos of his then-wife to a male friend.
The 34-year-old offender, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the victim's identity, pleaded guilty to one count of insulting a woman's modesty.
The court heard that the offender was self-employed at the time of the offence, selling second-hand cars.
Between December 2018 and May 2019, he sent photos of his wife to his male friend.
His friend reminded him that the photos were of his wife, but the offender told him ""not to worry"", because the couple was ""open-minded"".
The pictures include images showing the victim in her underwear.
In May 2019, the couple signed a deed of separation. A month later, the victim discovered that the offender had been sending intimate photos of her to two of his friends without her consent. She lodged a police report in November 2019.
The prosecution sought a fine of S$2,000, citing a low degree of planning and premeditation, and low degree of intrusion compared with other cases. There was also no exposure of private parts, and the offender was not caught red-handed.
At this, District Judge Janet Wang disagreed.
""I don't quite agree with you that he wasn't caught red-handed, from the fact that the wife found out. He was discovered in time by the victim, who then lodged a police report,"" she said.
She questioned the prosecutor about whether the marriage was ""still alive"" when the photos were circulated, and what happened to the two friends who received the photos.
The prosecutor confirmed that the couple was still married when the offender sent the photos, and said that while the victim alleged that two people had received the photos, investigations revealed that only one person did.
This person has not been charged nor warned, the prosecutor said at the judge's probing.
DEFENCE LAWYER SAYS CLIENT REGRETS HIS DECISION
Lawyer Narendra Mudaliar also asked for a fine of S$2,000, saying that his client has been cooperative with authorities and shared the intimate images with only one person.
""My client regrets his decision in sharing the pictures,"" he said. ""He has mentioned to me that it was a lapse of judgment, also driven by the breakdown of their marriage at the relevant time.""
Judge Wang interjected, pointing out that the man signed the deed of separation only in May 2019 and that the series of actions spanned the months before that, from December 2018, when the marriage was still ""alive"".
""Perhaps it's his actions that led, precipitated to the breakdown of the marriage,"" she said, adding that of course ""we don't want to be speculative"".
The lawyer added that his client is currently an undischarged bankrupt staying with his elderly mother and asked to pay any fine in instalments.
Judge Wang in sentencing said this case showed a ""display of human conduct at its abysmal low"", with the offender abusing spousal trust and demonstrating ""reprehensible and crass behaviour"".
The acts were committed over six months and could not be described as a one-off moment of folly, she said.
Both prosecution and defence agreed on a fine as the sentence, said Judge Wang, but the fine ""cannot be a mockery of the harm caused to the victim"".
She imposed a fine slightly higher than what both sides had asked for, and allowed the man to pay it in instalments by December.
For insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed up to a year, fined, or both."
Knife-wielding man who was shot by police in Clementi stand-off pleads guilty,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/knife-wielding-man-shot-police-clementi-stand-pleads-guilty-2967876,"SINGAPORE: A knife-wielding man who was shot by the police after attacking random passers-by and charging at officers pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Sep 27) to violence offences.
Soo Cheow Wee, 50, pleaded guilty to four charges including voluntarily causing hurt by using a cutting instrument, criminal intimidation and causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty. Another four charges will be considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Soo went to Geylang on the morning of Feb 17 and drank cough syrup and diazepam without prescriptions. 
After this, he returned to his mother's house in Clementi. Later that day, he called the police and said someone wanted to kill him and his mother.
He then took a knife, wrapped it in newspaper and left the unit. Soo loitered along a pavement in Clementi, claiming a voice told him to randomly target members of the public.
He approached several pedestrians, swinging his knife, but most of them managed to flee. Soo slashed a 41-year-old man who was on his evening stroll, injuring his arm.
CHARGED AT POLICE OFFICERS
After this, Soo flagged down a taxi and asked to be driven to Clementi Police Division. On the way, he gave conflicting instructions on where to go, and suddenly opened the rear door and tried to alight while the taxi was still in motion.
The driver, a 61-year-old man, alighted to check on Soo, who had fallen on the road. He saw that Soo was holding a knife, and Soo pointed the weapon at him before charging towards him.
The driver then got back into his taxi and locked the doors before driving to the entrance of Clementi Police Division to alert the police.
Soo turned his attention towards the police officers, walking towards them and shouting incoherently with the knife in hand. Despite the police's orders to stop and drop the knife, Soo continued to advance and suddenly charged towards one of the officers.
Sensing an imminent threat to the life and safety of the police officers, the officer fired a round from his service revolver, striking Soo, who fell down.
Soo was arrested and taken to a holding room. His injuries were not life-threatening, and he was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound. He was later discharged from hospital and has been in remand since.
On Tuesday, Soo also admitted to a previous incident in 2019 where he punched the face of an auxiliary police officer thrice. He did so after abusing cough syrup without a prescription. He was trying to return to a police station he was just released on bail from for drug consumption offences.
LONG LIST OF CONVICTIONS FROM 1989
The court heard that Soo had a long list of past convictions dating from 1989. Soo reoffended almost every other year since, receiving sentences ranging from probation to jail and stints in drug rehabilitation centres.
These were for offences such as theft, appearing intoxicated in public places, drug consumption, inhaling an intoxicating substance and assault on a public servant.
His latest conviction was in 2013, when he received seven years and six strokes of the cane for drug consumption. In 2017, he was placed under drug supervision for 24 months.
District Judge Luke Tan said he found this case to be ""disturbing"" in that a lot of Soo's psychiatric issues stemmed from self-induced consumption of substances. At the time of the offences, he was under a self-induced psychosis from cough syrup, he said.
He told defence lawyer Chooi Jing Yen that his client, who was assigned to him under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, seems to have a problem but has not addressed any of his problems despite medication.
Judge Tan cited another case, where an issue was raised about whether an offender who is well-behaved because of medication in jail will continue to be so outside of jail.
""Look at the videos,"" said the judge, pointing to closed-circuit television footage of the attacks. ""Random people were going about. He had a knife. He was chasing after a few (of them) ... thankfully those people were able-bodied, they could run.""
""Think about it -  if it was a feeble older individual, or a handicapped person who was there, not so mobile, what would have happened?""
Judge Tan added: ""If you know you have a problem, (but) you don't treat it, it becomes an issue for you and everybody. So what do you do about it?""
He called for a report assessing Soo's suitability for corrective training and adjourned the case. Corrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders without the usual one-third remission for good behaviour."

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said the collapse in the dormitory in Woodlands happened following heavy rain and strong winds on Sunday (Sep 25). Two other rooms sustained damage from mild water leakage.
The two workers who were injured suffered minor cuts and received medical treatment. About 100 residents in the affected rooms have been relocated temporarily to other rooms in the dormitory while repairs are ongoing, said MOM.
Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) officers have been deployed to the dormitory and MOM is conducting investigations.
“We are working with the dormitory operator to support affected migrant worker residents,” said MOM.

"Unhealthy routines, revenge travel: Why gyms have yet to bounce back from pandemic lows","Struggles faced by the fitness industry have been evident in recent weeks with the sudden closure of gyms like X Fitness and Superfly Studios.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fitness-studios-gyms-close-down-business-covid19-pandemic-2960076,"SINGAPORE: It has been more than a year since fitness enthusiasts were able to resume high-intensity indoor exercises with their masks off, but gyms in Singapore say that business has yet to bounce back to pre-COVID levels.
Rising costs, manpower shortages, new daily routines that eschew gym-going and renewed distractions in the form of travel are just some of the challenges facing fitness businesses that spoke to CNA.
The fitness industry has rallied this year to rebuild what it lost during the pandemic, said Mr Ross Campbell, co-founder of the SG Fitness Alliance, a non-profit industry association.
“Sadly several businesses had to close but we’ve gratefully seen several new investors and operators come into the market with exciting new facilities and member experiences.
“However, persistent headwinds still exist that are hindering most businesses’ full recovery to pre-pandemic levels,” Mr Campbell said.
SUDDEN CLOSURES
The struggles faced by the fitness industry have been evident in recent weeks with the sudden closure of gyms like X Fitness and Superfly Studios.
X Fitness, a spin studio at GR.iD mall in Selegie, went dark on the Internet in the middle of September, leaving customers unable to book classes and stranded with unclaimed class packages.
One customer told CNA that the gym did not inform her about the closure, and that her attempts to contact the studio were unsuccessful. 
The police have said that reports were lodged over the closures of X Fitness and affiliated brand Kyklos Studio, and that they are looking into the matter.
Police also confirmed that a report was lodged over the closure of Superfly.
The company launched in September last year and offered various exercise classes at three outlets.
A check of its Facebook page and Google reviews showed several comments by customers expressing unhappiness at a lack of communication and refunds after outlets closed.
A Superfly representative told CNA that the company gave customers a “gradual communication” about the closure from the last week of August, with a “final communication” before the month’s end.
The company added that staff were consulted beforehand and “a consensus was formed to wind down the business”.
Operations at its United Square studio were transferred to 24-hour fitness chain Anytime Fitness, while its studio at Forum The Shopping Mall is in the process of being taken over by another operator, the representative said.
Superfly said it had processed 75 per cent of customers’ class package refunds as of Sep 14, and expected to complete the remaining 25 per cent “in the next few weeks”.
The Superfly representative said the company had been making a loss since the start of the year.
“The shifting environment for fitness meant that plans made for the roll-out of the studios late last year did not pan out as we had expected.”
Superfly also said it “could not have foreseen the effect from the reopening of unrestricted travel and the full return to work which meant that customers had other priorities”.
“As a new brand, it meant it was harder to attract customers and staff. This, coupled with the shortage of manpower, (meant) we could not sustain the business and we made the difficult decision to wind down.”

BUMPY ROAD TO RECOVERY
The fitness studios that are still standing have had to navigate the ups and downs of the pandemic, with their initial recovery set back by COVID-19 measures last year.
“It has been a rollercoaster. After the first lockdown, plenty of members did return to the gym. However, things changed after we were hit by multiple waves of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert),” added Mr Lim Yao Peng, co-founder of Grityard.
“We observed that membership started to dwindle and attendance hasn’t been the same as before. To give a ballpark figure, attendance rate has reduced from 80 to 90 per cent to about 50 per cent.”
Another gym, Urban Den, entered its lease before the start of the pandemic. It waited until it saw improvements in consumer attitudes after the “circuit breaker” to open its doors.
“Anticipating the eventual return of individuals to the office, we wanted to be ready for their return and made plans to open the club,” said head of operations and facilities Nick Kraal.
“However, we were unfortunately impacted severely by the Heightened Alert.”
Mr Kraal said that with each round of eased restrictions, Urban Den, which is a brand under the True Group, has been able to allow more people back into the studios, raising membership numbers.
But the fitness industry is not bouncing back as much and as quickly as hoped even under the current relaxed rules – from optional mask-wearing in most settings to a full return to the office.
“It will take considerable time to attain the forecast numbers for a club of our size,” said Mr Kraal, citing a challenging backdrop of rising costs and increased competition.
“The focus on health and fitness amid the pandemic, and Singapore being ahead in opening up in Asia, has led to many competitors entering the market.”
This has put pressure on membership pricing since the start of the year, he said.
At the same time, most landlords offer little to no support in terms of costs, while fitness businesses must also contend with rising energy and service costs, said Mr Campbell.
This is amid “a depleted workforce of fitness professionals, practitioners and service staff, many of whom left the industry for gig economy jobs with larger guaranteed wages”.
“Overall, with rising costs, staff shortages, no rental relief and changing consumer behaviour, the road out of the pandemic has been a bumpy one for many fitness businesses,” he said.

NEW CONSUMER HABITS
New consumer habits – a lingering effect of the pandemic and the changes it brought to daily life and work – have also hurt recovery.
“The hangover effect of masks indoors, coupled with COVID protocol fatigue, has slowed down the recovery of members coming back,” said Mr Campbell.
“Consumers, stemming from two years of rolling mandates and protocols, have found new (often unhealthier) daily rituals and habits, some no longer coming into clubs, gyms and studios.”
Mr Lim echoed these sentiments: “They have created new routines for themselves, thus their visits to the gym (are) less frequent.”
Grityard has surveyed its members past and present to better understand their behaviour, and learnt that many of them are still on hybrid or work-from-home arrangements, said Mr Lim.
Mr Kraal similarly observed that many companies are still adopting work-from-home arrangements.
“For a fitness club in the CBD, we also need the crowd to return to work regularly for them to incorporate their fitness routine during workdays.”
He said that the gradual return to the office has prompted a slight improvement in gym visits before or after the workday, or over the lunch hour.
But not all aspects of the relaxed restrictions have been good for the fitness industry.
“It is also indeed true that the easing of borders has pulled regular members away, and fitness regimes have taken a backseat, particularly with consumers’ revenge travel,” said Mr Kraal.
He said that Urban Den saw “quieter months” from May to July despite the easing of restrictions in end-April, which saw the removal of group size limits and safe distancing, among others.
Could virtual classes fill the gap? There is higher demand compared to before the pandemic, but this has fallen considerably from the highs seen during the circuit breaker, said Mr Campbell.
“The Singapore Government is once again promoting healthier and active lifestyles, but this narrative was missing through most of the pandemic and takes time to rebuild,” he added.
For now, fitness businesses are keeping their sights trained on what matters to their customers.
“We don’t expect this to last,” said Mr Kraal of the quieter business, “because people are still focused on health.”"
"Singapore ‘in no position’ to prescribe actions but hopes US, China can keep open lines of communication: Lawrence Wong",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-no-position-prescribe-actions-us-china-open-lines-communication-lawrence-wong-2966711,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is “in no position” to prescribe actions for the United States and China, but it hopes both sides can keep open lines of communication, especially at the highest levels, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Sep 26).
By doing so, there will be an ability to establish “a new modus vivendi” between the two superpowers, he said at a dialogue session held as part of the Forbes Global CEO Conference 2022.
Simmering tensions between the major powers have been a challenge for both countries and businesses, given how ties between US and China is the “most consequential relationship in the world”. 
But US-China relations have been worsening day by day, owing to divisions ranging from ideologies, systems of government and more recently, escalating tensions over Taiwan, Mr Wong said.
“The fortunate thing is, I think on both sides, the leadership do not want direct confrontation at all because they know so much is at stake and there is everything to lose,” he added.
“So that restrains them somewhat, but we do worry that there may be accidents and miscalculations, which can cause things to worsen very quickly.”
Singapore is a friend of both the US and China, said Mr Wong, while adding: “We are in no position at all to prescribe actions for either party, but we have been encouraging both sides to keep open lines of communication, especially and including at the highest levels.”
“It’s good that the leaders on both sides have had a virtual meeting recently and they have agreed also to meet face-to-face quite soon.
“With that ability to come together to meet in person, there will be an ability to establish a new modus vivendi between the two countries, recognising that the world is big enough for China and US to coexist, and the two countries do not have to define their relationship in adversarial terms,” Mr Wong added.
While there can be “very rigorous” competition on several fronts, both countries also have several shared interests, especially in issues such as climate change and pandemic response which require the two major powers to come together in order for there to be progress, he said.
Domestic politics, in both US and China, is a barrier to easing tensions, said Mr Wong. While the current generation of leaders understand the stakes at play, the concern may lie with the next generation.
“Today's generation of leaders on both sides do understand the stakes because on both sides, people have seen what conflict is like and they don't want to see it happen in their lifetimes. What we should be worried about is … the next generation (who is) growing up in a very different environment, in both US and China.
“If there is no ability for that people-to-people connection and communication to happen, it’s very easy to portray the other side as the bad guy (and) we are the good guys,” he continued.
“And (if) both sides do that, you have a whole generation of people growing up thinking that way. Then what happens 20 years from now (or) 30 years from now?”
That is why, stressed Mr Wong, maintaining lines of communication and having people-to-people contact is important.
“Because it's all about building trust and you've got to do that at a strategic level between US and China,” he added.
“As the saying goes, trust is built painstakingly drop by drop, but trust can be lost in buckets very quickly. We hope that the leadership on both sides understand the importance of building trust, both for today and for the future.”
The dialogue session, moderated by Forbes Media’s editor-at-large Rich Karlgaard, also touched on issues such as the waning support for globalisation in the world and the future of free trade agreements.
Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, reiterated the “existential” importance of trade for Singapore and the region.
For the latter, the hope is for major powers to engage ASEAN in a more constructive and comprehensive manner, as well as “on its own merits, not through the prism of a US-China relationship or US-China competition”, he said.
The new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, launched by US President Joe Biden, can be a platform for the US to engage the region more comprehensively, although “the key is to make sure that this continues through different administrations”, he added.

ON SINGAPORE AS A FINANCIAL HUB
Asked about his hopes for Singapore as a global financial hub, Mr Wong noted how an industry transformation map was launched for the financial services sector about five years ago.
The annual targets under the roadmap were to achieve average real value-added growth of 4.3 per cent in the financial sector, while creating 3,000 net jobs between 2016 to 2020. But the roadmap has since surpassed targets on both fronts - the sector grew by an average of 5.7 per cent per annum over those five years, alongside the creation of an average of 4,100 net jobs each year.
Beyond that, there has also been a “growing vibrancy” across different segments in the industry, be it in capital markets, financial institutions and also the growing financial technology (fintech) space.
But Singapore does not take things for granted, said Mr Wong, which is why it has announced an update to the industry transformation plan recently.
“We are always paranoid that somebody else will take our lunch so we are continuing to set new targets for the next five years, to see what more we can do to deepen our capabilities, anchor new players in growing areas like digitalisation and sustainability,” he added.
On the country’s talent strategy, Mr Wong said given how the only resource that Singapore has is its people, it has to “turn that adversity into an area of strength” by developing human capital to its fullest potential.
“That’s for our own people in Singapore, giving them opportunities to excel, do their best, be the best that they can possibly be in all areas ... And at the same time, we want to stay open to bring in talent from around the world.
“And here in Singapore, you can form the best teams, comprising Singaporeans, as well as people everywhere, and we want you to be able to do exciting, cutting-edge innovative projects to push the frontier and take us forward,” he told the audience at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia hotel.
ON POLITICAL TRANSITION
Mr Wong was also asked by Mr Karlgaard about his relationship with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and when he might take over the reins.
In April, Mr Wong was named as leader of the ruling People’s Action Party’s fourth-generation or 4G team, paving the way for him to become Singapore's next Prime Minister. In June, he was promoted to deputy prime minister.
“It's not a question I can answer because we haven't decided,” Mr Wong replied, adding that his priority at the moment include tackling pressing issues facing the country such as cost of living, as well as navigating a possible economic slowdown next year and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.
“So these are taking up a lot of my time,” he added.
“We do think about the transition and the timing. The Prime Minister has said that he would like it to be sooner, and he never fails to remind me that this is something that’s on his mind,” Mr Wong said.
“But I have also said that we will do it at a time … when I'm ready for it and when I'm confident that the team is ready for it, I will let him know. And we will certainly let Singaporeans know in due course too.”"

The case was dismissed in February by the Court of Appeal. Mr Tan's case was one of the three challenges mounted against Section 377A. The other two were from disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, and Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.
At the same time, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that the law was “unenforceable in its entirety” and posed no credible threat of prosecution.
According to Section 377A of the Penal Code, any man who commits any act of gross indecency with another man in public or in private can be jailed for up to two years. This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act. 
Speaking during the panel discussion on Monday, Law Society president Adrian Tan touched on the case, and pointed out that the Court of Appeal did raise ""red flags"".
""They were saying: 'Look, this time the legal challenge is not going to succeed. But next time, it probably will.',"" said Mr Tan.
Professor Leslie Chew, who is dean of the Singapore University of Social Science's law school, said that the outcome of cases is never certain, and things evolve. He pointed out that the apex court is also not bound by its own decisions.
""In our system ... it is your constitutional right to challenge. And if you look at the history of issues that have been thrown up by Section 377A, it dates back to somewhere around 2013, It has been a whole decade of every now and then, (there is) a challenge. So the risk is real,"" he added.
In his opening address, Mr Shanmugam shared similar observations. He explained that there was a risk of Section 377A being struck down by the courts in the future, on the grounds that it could be judged to be in breach of Article 12 of the Constitution. 
Article 12 of the Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection.

NDR 2022: Singapore to repeal Section 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage













During his National Day Rally speech last month, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Singapore will repeal Section 377A.
The Government will also amend the Constitution to protect the definition of marriage – currently recognised by law as taking place between one man and one woman – from being challenged constitutionally in the courts, Mr Lee said.
IMPORTANT NOT TO ""DUCK""
During the panel discussion, Mr Shanmugam also touched on the decision to amend the Constitution to protect the definition of marriage, and emphasised that this was not a ""compromise"".
""We're not in the business of compromises. We sat down and we looked at the Tan Seng Kee judgment and we asked ourselves: 'Where is our society?' And we also asked ourselves, 'What is fundamental in this society?',"" he explained.
""We said that the definition of marriage that exists today in the Women's Charter is something this Government is deeply committed to. And we believe that while many people will either not mind or will welcome the repeal of 377A, we don't think Singaporeans are ready for a major sea-change in the tonality of our society and the way our society is the day after.""
The Law Minister also noted in his speech earlier the Court of Appeal's comments that politics seemed the more ""obvious choice"" than litigation for debating and resolving highly contentious societal issues.
""Courts have said this is within the province of Parliament. That does not mean the courts are saying that they will not act. What they are saying is: 'We leave it to Parliament to go and do what is right',"" he said.
""In Singapore, things have worked because each branch does what is right and what is their duty. If there is a law in the books which is unconstitutional, what is the duty of Parliament? What's the duty of the Executive? To deal with it or to put on the helmet, go into the bunker and pretend that it doesn't exist because it's politically too divisive? That's not the way things work in Singapore.""
As such, one must do the right thing and not ""duck"", Mr Shanmugam added.
""You don't say as other parliaments have said: 'Well, we leave it to the courts, hopefully they will deal with it.' If Parliament doesn't do what it has to do, then the courts will do what they don't want to do,"" he said.
Changing laws through the courts can be ""messy"", as most laws are interconnected, added Mr Tan.
""There's basically two ways that society can change laws. There's a messy legalistic process, which is asking the court to review a law and there is a neat democratic process which is through the Legislature,"" the Law Society president explained.

Risks of legal challenge to definition of marriage illustrated by Indian Supreme Court decision: Shanmugam













He noted that litigation is an ""appeal to law"" rather than a consultative process.
""In a sense to me, the Tan Seng Kee case also puts a bigger question to Singaporeans: How do we want to effect change in society? Do we want to do it through our democratic process, or do we want to go to court and challenge laws that we don't like? "" he said.
""When you change something through the court, it's quite brutal. The court is not probably going to say, when I strike down this law, I'm also going to look at 10 other laws that may refer to it. The court is just going to strike down that law, and then leave everybody else hanging.
""So my personal opinion is that that's a very messy way to effect change in society.""
Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said that Law Society president Adrian Tan noted that changing laws through the legislative process can be messy. It should be changing laws through the courts. We apologise for the error."
"Healthcare clusters to manage residents' health by region, run more community interventions under Healthier SG",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthiersg-regional-health-manager-healthcare-cluster-nuhs-nhg-singhealth-2965946,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's healthcare clusters will become ""regional health managers"" caring for residents in their geographical segment and running more community interventions under the Healthier SG initiative, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday (Sep 26).
The minister was giving more details on Healthier SG after a White Paper on the strategy was submitted to Parliament last week. The White Paper will be debated in Parliament in October.
Healthier SG, which aims to have citizens take charge of their own healthcare, involves having residents enrol with a single doctor - either a general practitioner or a polyclinic doctor - who will support residents in their health needs throughout their lives.

Free health screenings, vaccinations among plans for those enrolled under Healthier SG initiative













Singapore has three healthcare clusters: The National University Health System (NUHS), which runs hospitals and polyclinics in the west; the National Healthcare Group (NHG) in the central region; and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) in the east.
""As a regional health manager, the mission of a cluster is to look after the health of the geographical segment of population it is looking after,"" said Mr Ong. ""It goes far beyond running hospitals and polyclinics.""
""Clusters are already implementing health interventions in the community today, but this role will now expand in the coming years, from a relatively small proportion of a cluster's effort to quite a significant proportion in the future.""
Mr Ong said the Ministry of Health (MOH) would need to work with the clusters to take a ""strategic, holistic and system-level perspective"" to improve the health of Singapore's population.
He said this meant identifying the ""social determinants of health"", or the various factors in people's lives that can affect their physical, emotional and mental well-being, including their physical living environment, education, employment and food choices.
""We need a far better grasp of available information as well. That's the second point, to be able to link point of care data with community health data. We need to use research to connect the datasets and draw insights on which social interventions drive better health or overcome poorer health.""
MOH and the healthcare clusters would then have to engage community partners to ""go upstream"" and guide the development of population health, said the minister.
He added that these concepts were not new to the healthcare clusters, which have already been doing this, but that MOH was formalising and expanding the work.
""This includes evolving your key performance indicators, to feature population health and preventive care much more strongly,"" Mr Ong told an audience of healthcare professionals at the annual National Medical Excellence Awards.
He noted that residents may have established relationships with doctors in clusters and hospitals outside their residential region.
""For such cases, MOH will do budget transfers between healthcare clusters at the backend at the end of every year to account for residents' different usage patterns.
""Residents therefore do not need to be limited to hospitals under the cluster that looks after the geographical area they live in,"" he said.
Mr Ong added that COVID-19 had stressed Singapore's healthcare system ""severely, but the system did not collapse"".
""But this may well be a rehearsal for a much larger challenge coming our way, which is an ageing population of deteriorating health.
""It is not an epidemic curve that lasts several weeks, that we can ride through, but an inevitable trend of health deterioration lasting a couple of decades."""
The heroes who help the heroes: SCDF’s Special Response Unit does more than firefighting,"The unit has leveraged artificial intelligence and automation technology to enhance its decontamination and casualty conveyance operations to tackle manpower challenges.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scdf-special-response-unit-large-fires-2965911,"SINGAPORE: A fire breaks out at an industrial building, requiring intensive physical firefighting efforts and leaving several people injured.
Cue the Special Response Unit (SRU), a specialised unit within the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) that has several capabilities on top of supporting large or prolonged fire and rescue operations. 
The unit is armed with equipment that can transport multiple casualties at a go and provide on-the-spot heat injury treatment for responders. It can also conduct mass decontamination. The unit is trained in preparation for any incident at major events, like the upcoming F1 Singapore Grand Prix.

“For such standbys, the SRU primarily focuses on decontamination operations for mass casualties kind of incidents. Not only that, if called upon for any other incidents like firefighting, the SRU would be also augmenting in the overall operations,” its commander Tan Teck Ming told CNA.
The SRU has responded to several large-scale incidents, including the Nicoll Highway collapse in 2004, an oil tank fire at Pulau Bukom in 2011, and more recently, a fatal crash between two private buses in April this year. 
The crew responded to the accident on Apr 1 and conveyed 14 casualties to the hospital in a vehicle designed by the SCDF. In another incident earlier in the year, the unit was deployed to a large warehouse fire in Tuas for foaming operations – using foam to blanket any surface of flammable liquid present.

When SCDF frontline officers experience trauma after an incident, this team cares for their mental well-being













The SRU, which will mark its 20th anniversary later this year, has responded to more than 100 fire incidents, 70 rescue incidents, 30 mass casualty conveyance incidents, 15 water rescue incidents and 10 hazardous materials incidents.
With 13 mass decontamination vehicles, five multi-utility vehicles and one responders’ performance vehicle among its arsenal, the SRU plays a critical role in supporting frontline operations, SCDF said.
Made up mostly of full-time national servicemen, it was set up in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
CUSTOMISED VEHICLES 
In a bid to tackle manpower challenges due to the declining birth rate in Singapore, the SRU has leveraged artificial intelligence and automation technology to enhance its decontamination and casualty conveyance operations, SCDF said.
Among the SRU’s main stars is the mass decontamination vehicle designed by the SCDF and first used in 2016. Although it looks like a typical bus from the outside, it is far from one. The vehicle can transport up to 24 walking casualties at one go and also comes into play during emergencies such as a chemical attack.
It has a decontamination rate of 80 to 120 walking casualties on average per hour.
There are eight shower cubicles within the vehicle which are equipped with clean clothes, towels and slippers.
Another mode in the vehicle allows it to self-decontaminate and sanitise the air for its subsequent usage. The process takes less than an hour to complete.

At the unit’s disposal is also the responder performance vehicle, which allows personnel involved in prolonged operations to recover better.
Those at highest risk, exhibiting signs and symptoms of heat stroke for instance, will be put into a tub containing water at a temperature of five degrees Celsius.
For less serious cases, there are aluminium seats where officers can dip their arms in cold water to lower their body temperatures.
The vehicle is a result of collaboration among SCDF, medical doctors serving National Service with SCDF, academic researchers from the Department of Physiology at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and HOPE Technik, a local engineering company.
MORE HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT
The SRU will focus on enhancing its operational capabilities by leveraging more advanced technologies, SCDF said.
Proof-of-concept trials have taken place for the use of an autonomous casualty transporter developed by the SCDF and the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, SCDF said.
The transporter, which looks like a self-driving stretcher, will be used to automatically transport casualties from point to point within an incident site. While an officer will still accompany the casualties, it will reduce the manpower needed for such operations.
The SRU is targeting a total of six such transporters, which can also be used to move heavy items.
Studies are underway for the next generation of water supply modules and mass decontamination vehicles with enhanced capabilities for water supply and mass decontamination, SCDF said."

"The Big Read: Amid intensifying global talent war, Singapore faces juggling act in hunt for world's best and brightest",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/foreign-talent-singapore-workers-expats-companies-one-pass-2962481,"SINGAPORE: In the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Singapore unit of global consultancy firm, Mercer, saw many of its experienced expatriate workforce cutting short their stay here, partly due to the nation’s strict virus-control measures back then, and simmering anti-foreigner sentiments that had made them feel unwelcome.
As Singapore reopens its economy along with the rest of the world, filling the gap left by those professionals - most of whom with many years of experience and had developed “cultural alignment” here - has proved to be a challenge, said Mercer Singapore’s chief executive officer Peta Latimer, an Australian citizen who has lived in several countries.  
“The problem is a lot of organisations are (also) trying to desperately backfill because the economy has boomed back, and we're trying to grow as fast as possible. And so that is causing insane levels of competition (for talents),” she said.
Mercer’s experience highlights the difficulties faced by many companies here in hiring highly skilled workers - both within Singapore's shores and beyond - amid numerous international reports about the shortage of such talents.
Global consulting firm Korn Ferry had, in fact, predicted the situation back in 2018. In a report, the firm said that by 2030, the world can expect a skilled labour deficit of 85.2 million. 
And that prediction was made before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now, the situation is even more dire: More recently, New York stock exchange-listed human resource firm, ManpowerGroup, found that 75 per cent of more than 40,000 employers it surveyed in 40 economies were reporting “talent shortages” in 2022. This is a jump from the 54 per cent reported in 2019 and 69 per cent in 2021; it is also a 16-year high, said the firm.
The findings were in line with the views of employers, recruiters and economists interviewed in the past week by TODAY. The consensus is that competition for top talents is heating up as Singapore emerges from the pandemic.
This is due to factors such as economies recovering from the pandemic and now fighting over the same limited pool of talents, a ""hangover"" from border closures that has led to a slowdown of talent flow between countries, and companies clinging even harder to their existing employees as a result. 
What has been labelled as the ""global war for talent"" has seen many countries stepping up their game to court skilled labour from around the globe, especially the crème de la crème. 
In August, Singapore unveiled its Overseas Networks and Expertise (ONE) Pass and other “targeted enhancements” to the country's work pass framework. The five-year work pass allows foreigners earning at least S$30,000 a month to start, operate and work for multiple companies in Singapore at the same time

“In this climate, all the more, we need to be clear about where Singapore stands. We cannot leave any room for investors to doubt or to have questions as to whether Singapore remains open,” said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng at a press conference. 
He added: “As a country with little or no natural resources, talent is our only resource and talent acquisition is an offensive strategy for us.”
The ONE Pass offers better perks than the typical Employment Pass and is aimed at what Dr Tan described as the “rainmakers”.
Singapore is not the only place stepping up efforts to draw global talents. 
Back in May 2019, the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates launched its Golden Visa, which offers a 10-year residency period for select talents. Earlier this month, the criteria was relaxed to attract a more diverse pool of talents. Among other things, the eligible expatriate categories were expanded from five to seven to include ""humanitarian pioneers and frontline heroes"".
Meanwhile, Thailand also recently announced its aim to attract 1 million foreign talents over the next five years through its Long Term Residency visa that is valid for 10 years. Not missing a beat, Malaysia, too, announced its Premium Visa Programme soon after, which allows affluent individuals to stay in the country for up to 20 years.
On Singapore's moves, those interviewed by TODAY generally agreed that they would further reinforce the country's position as a destination for global talents.
However, they also raised some concerns, such as the need to increase the inflow of foreign professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) as well in some cases to support operations led by the top-tier talents.
Some also highlighted the potential spillover effects on society, such as driving up demand for housing and the possible negative signals sent to aspiring local talents.

NDR 2022: Develop Singaporeans while attracting foreigners to build 'world-class talent pool', says PM Lee













GLOBAL TALENTS INCREASINGLY SOUGHT AFTER
The 2018 Korn Ferry study, which used a model to extrapolate the demand and supply of skilled labour across 20 economies, estimated that by 2020, Singapore would face a deficit of 248,000 talents with post-secondary qualifications and above.
Meanwhile, a survey by GlobalManpower published earlier this year placed Singapore as third most talent-starved among 40 economies, with 84 per cent of companies here reporting talent shortage, above global average. 
Employers and headhunters attested to the challenging climate they face in trying to acquire top international talents.
“In recent years we have seen a high client demand for expertise in areas like digital, artificial intelligence, analytics, sustainability, cloud and more – and finding sufficient local talent to meet these demands can be challenging,” said Ms Ong Siok Peng, talent leader at Deloitte Singapore.
Mr Glenn Huybrecht, chief operations officer of crypto technology company Cake DeFi, reiterated that competition for top talents has been intensifying.
“We actually saw a big increase in interest from candidates (applying to us) who were (also) keen on the other nearby regional financial hubs. As a company based in Singapore, that was obviously a growing concern for our hiring plans,” said the Belgian. 
The company of more than 140 employees - more than half of them comprising Singapore citizens and permanent residents - recently announced plans to invest S$50 million over four years to double its existing research and development headcount.

Headhunters told TODAY that some executive candidates may already have several options or offers on hand by the time they get interviewed.
“Our biggest advice to clients is (be prepared), there’s an awful lot of offers rejected,” said Mr Jonathan Goldstein, managing partner of Page Executive, the executive search division of global recruitment services firm PageGroup.
Companies are also aggressively trying to hold on to their valued employees, posing a hurdle to firms that are hiring. 
“The HR department and the companies are also coming up with a lot more counter-offers now,” said Mr Finian Toh, managing director of global human resource executive search firm, ChapmanCG. 
Agreeing, Mr Ankit Kochar, senior director at recruitment firm Ethos BeathChapman, said that companies have realised it may be cheaper to counter-offer an existing employee with a pay hike, than go through the process of hiring a new one.
FACTORS THAT GLOBAL TALENTS CONSIDER 
Generally speaking, there are several universal factors that talents look at when deciding on a host country for the next phase of their careers.
Political stability of the country, ease of doing business and good infrastructure are among the considerations highlighted by those who spoke to TODAY. Incidentally, these are also among Singapore’s strong suits, they said.
Besides those directly related to their own work, elite talents also tend to take into consideration things that impact the lives of their family members, given that they are generally of an older age profile. 
These include a good educational and healthcare system, and something as basic as physical security.
“If my wife is out with my son for a walk and I have to worry that she's not going to come home safe, if I ever would have that feeling in Singapore - it doesn't matter how great the school system is here and it doesn't matter how great the healthcare system is - I'm going to leave,” said Dr Julian Hosp, chief executive officer and co-founder of Cake DeFi who is married with three sons.
Mr Goldstein from Page Executive said that while remuneration packages are still the top motivating factor, as they directly determine the kind of life an expat can provide for their dependents, these executives are increasingly taking into consideration what he calls “soft motivators”.
These would include cultural, value and “chemistry” fit with the host country and the teammates there, said Mr Goldstein, who is American. 




Listen: Why can't Singaporeans fill top jobs?














Associate Professor Walter Theseira referred to the Government’s recently announced plans to repeal Section 377A, which criminalises sex between men, and how the move may boost Singapore’s standing in terms of inclusivity.
The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community “might be a minority of the top talent … but beyond that minority, there are also companies and allies who would also not be comfortable moving to a place which they feel is discriminating against their friends in a certain way,""  said the economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), who is also a former Nominated Member of Parliament. 
Mr Goldstein noted that executives are also increasingly seeking a sense of purpose in the roles they are considering.
“During COVID … they asked themselves, ‘I'm working really, really hard for this company, for this job, whether it be the hours of travel or what have you, is there a greater purpose to what I'm doing?’” he said.
Meanwhile, memories of pandemic-triggered widespread lockdowns continue to cast a shadow on people’s decision to travel overseas, be it for work or otherwise.
Ms Latimer of Mercer said that a few years ago, its employees used to jump on opportunities for rotation to other global offices. In contrast, the firm's management now has to be proactive in getting employees to take on these opportunities. 
“The idea of changing your life and moving to another foreign country, when the memory of the pandemic and locked borders is very fresh, I think it’s slowing that down,” she said.
Mr Goldstein observed that in place of expats traversing across continents for work, there is a rise in ""nextpats"" - or talents who seek opportunities in neighbouring countries. 
“A 'nextpat' is someone from Malaysia who goes to Thailand, or from Thailand goes to Indonesia, or from Indonesia goes to the Philippines, so on and so forth, to run businesses, while they’re also closer to home,” he said. 
“They can help with the cultural nuances, and we are seeing quite a demand for that and more interest in that.”
All things considered, Singapore has consistently ranked highly on the annual Global Talent Competitiveness Index by business school Insead. The index ranks 134 countries based on how they grow, attract and retain talents.
Since the inception of the index in 2013, the country has been ranked overall second in rankings, except in 2020 when it came in third. In terms of ability to attract talents, which is one of the areas that the index looks at, Singapore has generally come out tops. 
Australian David Black, who is the founder and chief executive of Singapore-based research firm Blackbox, said that the country's appeal over the years has “both grown and diversified”, drawing talents from more and more regions.
Having been based here for 22 years and obtaining his permanent residency more than a decade ago, Mr Black added: “Singapore continues to be a magnet and its reputation, if anything, has only increased.”

WOULD ANTI-FOREIGNER SENTIMENTS DURING PANDEMIC AFFECT SINGAPORE'S APPEAL POST-COVID?
At the height of the pandemic, expats in Singapore had to contend with heightened job uncertainties and a spike in xenophobic sentiments. 
While the Government had consistently stressed to Singaporeans back then about the importance of keeping the country open to international talents, there were concerns about foreign competition over jobs. Acknowledging such concerns, policymakers rolled out schemes to support companies in hiring locals. 
The situation got a point where firms and foreign businesses chambers voiced concerns that Singapore was close to being perceived as being anti-foreigner and protectionist. 
About two years on and post-pandemic, does the impression still exist? 
Mr Goldstein said that he has personally never encountered anti-foreigner sentiments directly here, while Mr Black noted that the pandemic-driven “fear and stress” had brought out the best and worst instincts in people but there was no “real dip” in the level of interest in Singapore among global firms and talents.
“Problems were far worse elsewhere,"" said Mr Black, adding that Singapore has emerged from the pandemic in a better position as a ""key Asian business centre"" compared with Hong Kong. 
He added: “Overall, the benefits of Singapore to outsiders far outweigh anything they might hear about local concerns here."" 
By and large, headhunters agreed that the continued interest by foreign professionals to come here show that the wave of anti-foreigner sentiments during the pandemic did not create much of a dent on Singapore’s global image.
However, for some expatriates in Singapore, it was not something that they could easily get over. 
Cake DeFi's Dr Hosp, for one, could not help but feel somewhat seen as an ""other"", when his employment pass renewal was initially rejected. 
The Austrian citizen said this was despite his feeling that he had done his best to contribute to Singapore. “Despite all that, I feel like I’m constantly asked ‘Why are you here? Why are you taking someone else’s work away?’” he said, referring to the anti-foreigner sentiments going around then.
While he did not make active plans to move elsewhere - he said he viewed his relationship with Singapore as akin to a “partnership” which he would not terminate merely over some frustrations - Dr Hosp did feel at the time that he and his family should start thinking of other options.
Nevertheless, he managed to get his employment pass renewed in the second quarter of last year. He stressed that he does not intend to move elsewhere as it makes most sense to remain in Singapore on both a personal and professional level.
Similarly, Ms Latimer cited how some long-term pass holders who had temporarily left Singapore before the pandemic struck were not allowed to return for a long time when borders closed, despite them having work commitments and rented homes here. 
“That left a bit of a bitter taste in some people's mouths … And I think people who were planning on leaving Singapore in the next five years, probably brought forward that timeline,” she added.

DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said the anti-foreigner sentiments from some quarters during the pandemic were “definitely a concern” for the Government.
Which was why policymakers adopted a ""more targeted approach"" via the ONE Pass initiative, after having refined and tightened the overall Employment Pass (EP) scheme, he said.
In March, the Government announced a new Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for EPs — a points-based system that ensures EP requests are evaluated in a more comprehensive and transparent manner.
Assoc Prof Theseira of SUSS, said that besides its practical benefits, the ONE Pass has also generated some ""public relations"" value for Singapore.
The coverage by many international media on the announcement puts Singapore “on the radar” when talents are considering a move, he said.
CIMB bank economist Song Seng Wun noted that the Government has been “relatively balanced” in handling the xenophobic sentiments during the pandemic.
The fact that more foreigners still want to come to Singapore than those who wish to leave the country speaks for itself, Mr Song reiterated. 
Indeed, both Mr Toh from Chapman CG and Mr Goldstein of Page Executive said that they still see strong interest from expats to work here despite what had happened during the pandemic.
ARE SINGAPORE'S MOVES ENOUGH? 
Some companies interviewed said that more can also be done to address talent shortages at other levels besides the top-tier talents targeted by ONE Pass.
Singapore-founded tech company, Razer, pointed out that while it welcomes ONE Pass as an initiative that can be leveraged to elevate the company “to the next level” while grooming its existing team, in reality “both S Pass and Employment Pass holders make up a majority in our foreign talent mix for our Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore”.
These employees bring to the table specific skill sets that are difficult to find locally, yet are not niche enough to warrant a remuneration more than S$30,000 a month.
In attracting these S Pass and EP holders, “the rising cost of living, largely driven by the higher rental prices, remains a significant deterrent,” said Razer global head of human resource April Wan. 
She added: “Any government initiatives to keep the property rental market competitive would be welcomed.""
Mercer's Ms Latimer noted that the ONE Pass initiative is useful in attracting talents who can help her company look at new business or expand into new products. However, the company is in need of a large number of talents with different expertise.
“It's just not possible to get the volume of candidates locally to fill even our business-as-usual needs,” she said, adding that the company would end up having some roles open for a long time. “And so the ability to open up and attract more people at that mid-level, is actually where I think additional policy changes (need to be thought about).”
Mercer currently has around 480 employees in Singapore, with eight in 10 being local workers.
Ms Latimer stressed that she agrees with the Government's push to prioritise local talents for PMET jobs, but she was still concerned that the volume of such talents needed by firms here to spur further growth might not be matched with existing supply.
According to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) latest figures up to the first half of the year, resident employment surpassed the pre-pandemic level in December 2019 by 4.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, job vacancies stood at 126,100, higher than 117,100 in December 2019.
About 31 per cent of the job vacancies in June were from ""growth sectors"" of information and communications, financial and insurance services, professional services, and health and social services.
Together with the unveiling of ONE Pass, MOM also announced enhancements to the EP, offering a five-year option to those who fill certain roles on the COMPASS Shortage Occupation List. This is, however, specific to tech roles, and the list will only be released in September next year.

Ethos BeathChapman's Mr Kochar pointed out that ""when it comes to starting something new that has not been done before by the firm, it cannot be done by just one top executive"".
He said: ""They would need their own ‘army’, if not 100 per cent at least 20 or 30 per cent (of a team)."" 
But he added: ""(The rollout of) ONE Pass is also about saying … we have a working army, now we’re getting a leader to lead the army.”
IMPLICATIONS OF WOOING ELITE GLOBAL TALENTS
Earlier this month, Dr Tan said in Parliament that as part of Singapore's global talent ""offensive"", agencies such as the National Arts Council and Ministry of Education will help identify not just high-earners but ""exceptional talent"" in fields such as the arts, sports and science,
These high-achievers will not need to meet the S$30,000 monthly salary criterion for ONE Pass, and will help push Singapore to “new frontiers, draw in greater investments … (and) create a very diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans”, said the Manpower Minister. 
Mr Song of CIMB bank said this signals Singapore’s effort to support the growth of non-business fields, given that their top talents will be accorded similar treatment with business leaders in terms of work passes.
However, there are concerns from some of those interviewed about potential side effects of Singapore's targeted strategy of going after top-tier talents, be in business or other fields.   
“I would argue that by setting it up as some sort of ‘platinum card’ may cause envy and resentment down the line,” said Mr Black of Blackbox.
“Even if the numbers accepted are relatively small, talented (locals) may feel, rightly or wrongly, that such a scheme means they will be overlooked for top jobs in favour of a foreigner,” he said. 
Mr Black's views were echoed by sociologists interviewed.
Associate Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Social Sciences said that the ONE Pass initiative may inadvertently ""be seen as creating a two-tiered workforce, even among foreign skilled professionals working here"". 
She also expressed concern that it may lead to a situation where a company would lean towards parachuting readily available top talents from elsewhere to take up apex roles, instead of investing time and resources in training Singaporeans to move up the ladder.
Dr Rebecca Grace Tan from National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Humanities and Sciences said that while the ONE Pass is currently “quite restrictive” in terms of qualification criteria and validity period, “it is not clear that the incentives for foreigners will stop here”, as Singapore continues to be in a “global talent arms race”. 
“This is especially so given the hypermobility of the super-rich. For example, James Dyson moved to Singapore in 2019 and returned back to the United Kingdom in 2021,” she said.
“Instead, we are likely to see more and more incentives rolled out to attract and retain foreign talent, much like what we saw in Europe which accumulated in the provision of permanent residency based on how much migrants invested.""
Questions on ensuring skills transfer have also been raised in Parliament, with MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asking if such training requirements can be codified into law, while other MPs suggested time-limited EPs to ensure skills transfer.
In response, Dr Tan cautioned “against too deterministic an approach” as skills transfer is not a simple or linear process.
Over the years, government leaders have repeatedly stressed that developing local talents remains a priority, even as it taps on the global skilled workforce to help drive the economy.
Most recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that investing heavily in human capital locally “has and will continue to be a cornerstone"" of the Government's development strategy.
Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, was speaking last week at the launch of the financial services sector's second industry transformation map. At the launch, it was also announced that S$400 million has been committed to developing local professionals as part of the sector's five-year blueprint.
Meanwhile, a constant bugbear when it comes to discussing the presence of foreign talents here is the concern over housing and rental prices.
Property analysts cautioned that the push to attract global talents, especially the top tier ones, would drive up demand for housing in Singapore. 
Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, expects the rental market to feel the impact first, “especially for the luxury segment given (the top global talents') high salaries and expat packages”.
Agreeing, Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director for research at Huttons Asia, said that rentals for other market segments will probably rise as well, albeit to a lesser degree than luxury homes.
Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA, said it might be too early to talk about the impact of the ONE Pass initiative on the property market. Nevertheless, he noted that foreign buyers “are already active in buying and selling high-end residential properties”.
 
Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Group, cited official data which showed that 180 new homes were bought by foreigners in the second quarter of this year. “This was the highest number of units purchased by foreigners since the third quarter of 2019, when there were a total of 182 units transacted,” he added.

Regardless of the potential impact of the ONE Pass initiative, the reality is that all cities and countries have always been engaged in competition for desirable immigration, said Assoc Prof Theseira.
In the case of Singapore, locals have the skills necessary to compete at the highest levels, “but our problem is that we don’t have enough of the numbers”, he said. 
He reiterated that being both a city and a country, Singapore faces a significant limitation - in competing against other global cities - of not having a hinterland to draw additional manpower from.  
“If we don't have some kind of policy to think about assimilating or attracting foreign talent, we are actually severely handicapping ourselves. Because competitor cities, even if they stop bringing in external talents, they can still take in local talents from other parts of their country,” he said.
Nevertheless, he believes that it would be helpful for the Government to be more open in publishing data and outcomes of foreign talent policies, in order to demonstrate their positive impact on the public. 
To mitigate against a divide between foreigners and locals in Singapore, Mercer's Ms Latimer stressed the need to go beyond facts and figures by providing opportunities for both groups to interact with each other and form personal bonds. 
“Try and create opportunities for people to mingle and meet people who are different to them. Because it's very hard to dislike somebody, if you've met somebody and at least have gotten to know their point of view,” she said.
“You might not agree with them, but it's hard to dislike them.”

Singapore risks gentrification if public housing left to market forces: Desmond Lee,"""Some areas will become very central, very exclusive, very gentrified, all the rich people want to live there, developers will respond to that, and then society will change,"" says the Minister for National Development.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ministry-national-development-desmond-lee-forward-singapore-session-gentrification-public-housing-free-market-sources-2964136,"SINGAPORE: Singapore risks gentrification and stratification if it leaves public housing to market forces, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Sunday (Sep 25).
Such issues are visible in successful cities around the world, as ""invisible but powerful socioeconomic forces"" segregate where people live according to their means, he added.
To prevent this from happening in Singapore, the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model was launched last year to build Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in central locations - so that these areas ""do not become exclusive neighbourhoods that only the well-to-do can enjoy in private housing"", said Mr Lee.
Under the PLH model, selected Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in prime locations will come with extra subsidies, but those who later sell their units have to pay HDB a percentage of the resale price.
A 10-year minimum occupation period - double that of typical projects - also applies before owners can sell their flats.

Said Mr Lee: ""If we leave it to the free market ... Some areas will become very central, very exclusive, very gentrified, all the rich people want to live there, developers will respond to that, and then society will change.
""So we want to use PLH deliberately to set aside land in those areas, and build public housing and ensure that over the many generations, they remain affordable.""
The minister was speaking in an opening address at his Ministry of National Development's (MND) first Forward Singapore engagement session on public housing.
Launched in June by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Forward Singapore is a year-long exercise led by the ruling party's fourth-generation team to review Singapore's social compact.
The exercise is organised along six pillars, which include the home and living environment, Singapore identity and environmental sustainability among others.

WP calls for BTO eligibility age for singles to be lowered, boost in HDB flat supply













In his speech, Mr Lee noted that Singapore's social compact on housing ""has not been and never will be"" static, and that policies have constantly evolved to keep pace with societal changes.
""We remained alert to the powerful and invisible social and economic forces that could shape our housing landscape over time,"" he said. ""We wanted to ensure that our housing estates remained inclusive and cohesive, even as our society became more diverse and better-off.""
Mr Lee gave the example of the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP), which sets race-based quotas for HDB flats to avoid ethnic concentrations.
To address the concerns of families facing difficulties selling their flats due to the policy, HDB announced in March that it would buy back EIP-constrained flats from eligible flat owners unable to sell their homes at a reasonable price.
""This was to smoothen the rough edges, while preserving the important social objectives,"" said Mr Lee, who is also Minister-in-charge of Social Services and Integration.

ACCESSIBLE HOUSING FOR SENIORS
Mr Lee said new policies have been introduced over the years to make public housing more accessible to the likes of singles and senior citizens.
Compared to the previous offering of studio apartments on 30-year ownership durations, seniors now have 2-room Flexi flats with more flexible leases to accommodate their plans, he pointed out.
""We have built integrated senior housing in Kampung Admiralty, continuing to study whether such a model really empowers the seniors living there, because it is a vertical kampong,"" Mr Lee added.
""And (we) are trying another one out, with slightly different configurations, at Yew Tee. Again, seniors housing integrated with different services.
""We see what the seniors respond to, how to ensure in seniors housing we have mixing that draws young people, young children to come and make use of the facilities and interact with the seniors.""
The minister said a second pilot batch of Community Care Apartments - after the first in Bukit Batok - will be launched soon to provide housing with senior-friendly features and customisable care services.
There is also an Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme to help seniors to monetise their flats even as they continue living in them, said Mr Lee.
""Our public housing journey reflects and mirrors the growth and development of our society as we evolve and change. And it is a product of the evolving social compact between Government and people, and between each and everyone of us,"" he said.
""And what we decide to do, what we decide to consume or use, will also impact what is available for future generations."""
"Upholding inclusive, rules-based multilateral system is 'only way forward': Vivian Balakrishnan","Climate change and food insecurity, pandemic preparedness and digital transformation are three areas where there is an urgent need to build resilience, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan told the UN General Assembly.

""It is in the world's interest and in our own national long-term interest to set aside our differences, to address the challenges of the global commons, and to harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies,"" he said.
Delivering Singapore's statement to the UNGA in New York, Dr Balakrishnan said the post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity had come to an end.

Commentary: With shock mobilisation, a desperate Putin has chosen to escalate













""A new world order is being born and ... the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous. So, will we have a more divided, less prosperous and less peaceful world?
""Or instead, can we strengthen multilateralism and the UN to deal with the challenges of the future, to uphold and to strengthen the rules-based international system, and to jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies – including digital technology, synthetic biology and customised healthcare, and of course renewable energy?
""If we can do this, we can then create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone.""
He highlighted three areas where there is an urgent need to build resilience.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD INSECURITY
One is climate change, which remains ""the most pressing challenge confronting humanity today"", said Dr Balakrishnan.
""We need a sustained and ambitious global response. Continued commitment by all countries to the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact – that's absolutely critical. We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero.""
This will require considerable economic restructuring, technological breakthroughs, investments and behavioural changes, with the UN-led multilateral system key in pulling everyone together to move in the same direction without leaving any behind, he said.
He highlighted Singapore's moves to raise climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions ""by or around mid-century"" and progressively raise carbon taxes, which were announced at Budget 2022.
A related issue is food security, the threat to which has been exacerbated by climate change, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, he said. The minister cited a UN report stating that 828 million people were affected by hunger last year – 46 million more than in 2020 and 150 million more than in 2019.
""We must reverse this negative trend. First, we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly.
""Second, we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges. For example, working together to develop climate-resilient food systems, whilst developing the necessary precautions for food safety.""

PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS
Dr Balakrishnan also said it was essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect future generations.
""After COVID-19, there will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. In my view, actually COVID-19 was perhaps a full dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come,"" he said.
""We must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion.
""We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding under-investment in pandemic preparedness, amongst other global public goods.""
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The minister also stressed the need for an open and inclusive global framework to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution while addressing its challenges.
""The digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum. It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues – the geopolitical tensions, technological bifurcation, cybersecurity threats and the digital divide,"" he said.
""The world has made significant progress by developing based on a single, shared technology stack. Interconnectedness, interoperability has brought us together, lowered costs, spurred innovation and competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas.
""But if we fracture our world and our technology stack, all that good work and that speed of progress and innovation will be slowed down significantly.
""A zero-sum, exclusionary, bifurcated approach benefits no one. An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyber threats and malicious cyber activities,"" he added.
Dr Balakrishnan reiterated Singapore's full support for the UN Secretary-General's proposal for a global digital compact, adding that all states should benefit from the digital revolution and not be left behind.
US-CHINA RELATIONS, MYANMAR
Speaking to reporters after his address, Dr Balakrishnan said that the mood at this year's UNGA was ""somewhat sombre"" as it was taking place during a time of anxiety, including over the relationship between the US and China.
He said the recent rhetoric and actions occurring across the Taiwan Strait were of ""grave concern"", but that he was hopeful given the meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in New York.
""I think both sides understand the gravity of the situation. We can only hope that cool heads and good sense will prevail, and they will avoid the possibility of mishaps, miscalculations, accidents or worse, getting into an escalatory spiral.""
Dr Balakrishnan said the next two to three months would be ""vital"" in de-escalating the situation, and expressed hope that US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be able to meet on the sidelines of upcoming summits and arrive at a modus vivendi.
A modus vivendi refers to an arrangement or agreement allowing conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or until a final settlement is reached.
Turning to the situation in Myanmar, the minister said he was ""pessimistic"", noting reports of continued violence and political detentions.
""Our view remains that the only way out of this quagmire is for political reconciliation, and for good faith discussions and negotiations between all the parties,"" he said, adding that this must involve both Myanmar's former leader Aung San Suu Kyi and military leader Min Aung Hlaing."
Uplifting lower-wage workers not as easy as just setting minimum salaries: DPM Wong,"Singapore must be careful of “unintended consequences” when working through solutions to advance the well-being of lower-wage workers, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-alliance-action-lower-wage-workers-minimum-salaries-jobs-2962856,"SINGAPORE: Uplifting lower-wage workers is not as easy as just setting minimum salaries and Singapore must be careful about “unintended consequences” when working through solutions, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Saturday (Sep 24).
Speaking at a workshop for the Alliance for Action for Lower-Wage Workers, Mr Wong said that advancing the well-being of lower-wage workers is an important priority for the Government, and that is why it is putting in a lot more resources to uplift lower-wage workers. 
But while Singapore wants to see lower-wage workers get higher starting salaries, it is also important that these workers see continued career progression throughout their working lives.
“This means not just good starting salaries but having the new wage increases tied to a skills ladder,” said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
“Ultimately, what we want to achieve is a compression of wages in our workplace, not increasing wage gaps but wage compression taking place largely by uplifting of lower-wage workers in Singapore,” he added.
He added that pursuing the objective is not as straightforward as it sounds, and that it is not just about putting minimum salaries in place.
Saying that there is ""no silver bullet"" in solving the problem, he cited examples of some countries with the highest minimum wages which also have high wage disparity and high unemployment rates.
“At the stroke of a pen, you can decide that this is the new minimum wage. But what are the consequences of that? Will companies end up hiring less workers? Will you have more unemployment?"" he said.
“Or perhaps, in some cases, what other countries have seen is that a number of the beneficiaries of a higher minimum wage are not low-income families but young people from rich families who go out and work at minimum wage levels.
“So these are all unintended consequences that can easily happen if you're not careful in thinking about the right solutions.""
Singapore has to think through and work together with different stakeholders on the best solutions to improve the well-being of lower-wage workers, he added.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government works together with employers, union leaders and workers instead of doing things through a top-down approach.
“It takes longer for such an approach to work. It is because you have to build consensus and you have to bring people along with you, so it takes longer,” he added.
“But I think it is an approach that leads to more enduring solutions - solutions that work, not because of political headlines, but solutions that make an impact on the ground.”

BUY-IN FROM EMPLOYERS
In his speech, Mr Wong noted that while wages are important, there are also other areas where the well-being of lower-wage workers can be improved.
These include opportunities for them at the workplace, skills training and upgrading, rest areas and workplace conditions.
Often, buy-in from employers is very important, Mr Wong added.
“They play a critical role and we need to get employers to change their mindsets as well, from understanding the importance of the contribution of every worker to looking at wage dispersion within the organisation, but importantly, just valuing the contributions of every worker within the organisation,” he said.
He said that no organisation has a flat salary structure across the board and that there will always be a range. The question, he added, is how to keep the range compact and make sure every worker is valued. 
“It is one thing to narrow the wage gap, but how do you narrow the status gap? That is a very hard thing to do.
""It has to do with mindsets. How do you get people to recognise and appreciate the contributions, the dignity and the value of every worker regardless of their salaries?""
Wrapping up his speech, Mr Wong urged the Alliance for Action for lower-wage workers to participate in the Forward Singapore exercise and provide their feedback on what more Singapore can do on the policy front. 
In his Budget 2022 speech earlier this year, Mr Wong announced that the Government will spend S$9 billion over five years to uplift and support lower-wage workers.
He had also reiterated that the Progressive Wage Model will be extended to various sectors such as retail, food services and waste management in the coming years, as previously announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at last year’s National Day Rally.
Under the expansion, retail staff will receive wage increases over three years starting from this month.
Separately, about 159,000 lower-wage workers in sectors not covered by the Progressive Wage Model will earn at least S$1,400 under a new local qualifying salary requirement which also kicked in on Sep 1."
Woman arrested in China officials impersonation scam involving staged kidnap,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-arrested-china-officials-impersonation-scam-staged-kidnap-2962726,"SINGAPORE: A 21-year-old woman suspected to be involved in a China officials impersonation scam was arrested after police received a report on a kidnapping case which turned out to be staged.
The police said in a news release on Saturday (Sep 24) that they received a report on Tuesday that another 21-year-old woman had allegedly been kidnapped. 
Before the report was made, the victim's parents in China received a video of their daughter with her hands and legs tied up, with a ransom demand from an unknown person communicating in Mandarin.
Following the report, police conducted searches and investigations to locate the victim and she was found to be safe and sound on Thursday, in a Yishun flat rented by the 21-year-old woman.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the victim had earlier received a call from someone purporting to be from the Health Ministry in Singapore. The person alleged that a phone line registered in the victim’s name was used to cheat people in China.
""When the victim denied this, the call was redirected to another scammer purporting to be an officer from the 'China Police', who further alleged that a bank account in her name was also found to be involved in money laundering activities in China,"" said the police.
The victim was deceived into transferring more than S$350,000 as ""bail money"" to the scammer to avoid being deported.
The victim, acting on the scammer's instructions, also recorded a video of herself being tied up to assist in purported investigations.
""Thereafter, the scammer told the victim to cease communication and isolate herself in a 'safe house' that the scammer had arranged,"" said the police.

The victim did not know the scammer had sent the video to her parents in China and demanded a ransom for her release.
After the police report was made, the police found the victim in a unit rented by the 21-year-old woman.
The woman had acted on the scammer’s instructions to rent the room for the victim, and handed over a mobile phone with SIM card for the victim to use to communicate with the scammer, follow-up investigations revealed.
Police investigations are ongoing.
A total of 476 China officials impersonation scams were reported in the first eight months of this year, with losses amounting to at least S$57.3 million. 
For the whole of last year, 752 cases were reported, with losses amounting to S$106.4 million. This was a jump from 2020, when there were 442 cases and reported losses of S$39.7 million.
The police also highlighted that China Police, Interpol and other overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction to help with any form of investigation without approval from the Singapore Government.
They also advised members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls from unknown parties, especially those with the '+' prefix which originate overseas: 
Ignore such calls and the caller’s instructions. No government agency will instruct payment through a telephone call or other social messaging platforms;
For foreigners receiving calls from people claiming to be from police in your home country, call your embassy or high commission to verify the claims of the callers;
Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on websites or to callers over the phone;
Do not make any funds transfer if the caller is of dubious identity.
Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act;
If in doubt, always hang up the call and check with the Singapore Police Force.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-airport-drug-check-enforcement-traveller-thailand-cannabis-2957591,"SINGAPORE: Two years after COVID-19 halted travel and turned Changi Airport into a ghost town, the air hub has come alive again. 
Crowds of travellers form queues at check-in counters. Families wave off loved ones at boarding gates. Suitcases roll by on baggage belts.
But even as the buzz returns to Changi, another challenge has come up for Singapore's security agencies – the legalisation of cannabis in other countries, most notably nearby Thailand, which started allowing the use of the drug in June.
With more than 16.5 million passengers having passed through Changi Airport this year, how is Singapore keeping drugs like cannabis at bay?
CNA got an inside look into the process, which starts at a restricted area on the tarmac where check-in baggage from flights are processed after they land.
This is where Bailey, a six-and-a-half-year-old English springer spaniel from the police K-9 unit, is stationed with his handler Sergeant Ryan Low.

As luggage is unloaded from carts onto a moving conveyor belt, Bailey walks on it, sniffing at the locked suitcases and expertly leaping over each one at SGT Low's command.
After several minutes of Bailey nosing through suitcases, the baggage from the flight we are observing, SQ278 from Adelaide, comes out clean.
But if a police dog does spot something suspicious, what happens? ""Different dogs, different ways,"" said SGT Low.

There are generally two ways a police dog will signal that something needs a closer look. In a ""positive indication"", the dog's nose will point towards the area of interest. In an ""active indication"", the dog will paw the area of interest.
When this happens, the suspicious suitcase and adjacent items are pulled down from the belt for the K-9 unit to verify the finding, said SGT Low.

CHECKS ON TRAVELLERS
Off the tarmac, enforcement efforts continue on the other side of the luggage belt, with random checks on travellers leaving the arrival hall.
In an enactment by Home Team officers, a mock traveller is called over for a check as she wheels her suitcase to the exit. Her luggage first passes through an X-ray scanner.

She then undergoes an IONSCAN, a high-tech swab that can detect trace amounts of narcotics or explosives. An Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer moves the handheld device over the traveller and her belongings.
This is what ends up giving her away. The IONSCAN emits a sound indicating the presence of drugs. The traveller is taken to the ICA baggage office, tucked into a corner of the arrival hall, for a more detailed screening.

In the office, two Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers perform a detailed search of her suitcase, laying it open on a metal table and examining each item. They leave nothing unturned as she stands by the side watching.
After that, a female CNB officer leads her into another room for a body search.

This turns up something suspicious – a small, plastic packet containing a brown substance, stuffed into an innocuous-looking pack of breath mints.
An officer puts a sample of the brown substance into a portable drug screening kit no bigger than the palm of his hand.

Such enhanced detection kits have been in use since March. They can detect a wider variety of controlled substances almost instantly – within five seconds. This is up to four times faster than before, said CNB.
The test indicator turns purple, indicating the presence of a controlled drug. This is enough to suspect that the ""traveller"" has committed drug offences, and to arrest her.
CNB officers cuff her on the spot, and she is led away to provide a sample for a urine test.
PREVENTION AND EDUCATION
Aside from detecting contraband, CNB officers also try to educate travellers about the consequences of entering Singapore with drugs.
At the departure hall, officers hand out flyers listing common drugs and their street names, the physical and psychological effects of taking drugs, and the maximum penalties for drug offences.
The flyers also contain an advisory that individuals who consume illegal drugs overseas can be arrested and face the same penalties as if they had committed the offence in Singapore.
That is up to 10 years in jail, a fine of up to S$20,000 or both for consuming a controlled drug.
This advisory about the extraterritoriality of Singapore's drug laws can also be found on a standee prominently located just before the restricted area of the departure hall.

The standee reminds travellers that they cannot import or sell products containing cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD) oil, hemp or hemp seed oil.
These can contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis that is a Class A controlled drug in Singapore.
These are all part of CNB's efforts to keep travellers informed as borders reopen and travel resumes after the COVID-19 pandemic, including to nearby Thailand.
TOURISTS VISITING THAILAND USE CANNABIS FOR RECREATION
Since Thailand legalised cannabis on Jun 9, the use and sale of products from the plant have expanded in parts of the country.
In Bangkok, a number of shops selling cannabis buds can be found around touristy areas such as Khaosan Road and Thonglor Road.
The legalisation was passed with the objective of promoting cannabis for medical and health purposes. However, there are signs that both Thais and foreigners are using it for recreation.

""Many tourists would just fly to Thailand for a week to smoke it and leave,"" said Nat Tangtanakul, owner of Choo-choo Hemp told CNA.
The business opened in June, one day after the law was passed. It has since welcomed both locals and international travellers. There are also clients who are suffering from pain after accidents.
""One of them had broken both of his legs and came to the shop from the hospital,"" he said.  
 
According to Nat, there are about 30 to 40 customers per day. They tend to come in groups but sometimes, he also sees solo backpackers.
Some of them would stay for hours to try different types of cannabis, he said.

After the decriminalisation, it is now legal in Thailand to buy and sell cannabis plants, their parts such as buds and leaves and extracts.
However, the extracts must not contain more than 0.2 per cent by weight of THC.
""Importantly, it must be noted that smoking of cannabis in public is forbidden. The penalty for this is a potential three-month jail sentence and 25,000 baht (US$676) fine,"" said the Tourism Authority of Thailand on its website.
According to Thailand’s Food and Drug Administration, the sale of marijuana to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and people aged below the age of 20 is prohibited.
Earlier this month, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said that ""the freer availability of cannabis in Thailand, to which a lot of Singaporeans go to and from, where a lot of tourists come to Singapore, is going to present more challenges"".
He said that if there is clear evidence of the current use of drugs, Singapore authorities will take action, regardless of whether the consumption was in Singapore or overseas.
The minister also cited research showing that the use of cannabis is harmful and addictive, noting that it can cause irreversible brain damage, brain shrinkage, serious mental and psychiatric illnesses.

MORE ARRESTS AT CHANGI AIRPORT
With the resumption of overseas travel after the pandemic, there have been more arrests of suspected drug offenders at Singapore's borders.
As of August, CNB has arrested 41 Singaporeans and permanent residents for suspected drug abuse at the country's various checkpoints this year.
This is a significant increase from the six arrests made in the whole of 2021 and 30 arrests in the whole of 2020, when global travel restrictions were still largely in place.
But the figure is still far from the numbers seen in the three consecutive years before the pandemic, when the number of arrests consistently crossed the 120 mark.
CNB conducted more than 180 joint enforcement operations at Changi Airport from January to August, while more than 260 operations were carried out at other air, land and sea checkpoints.
More than 2,000 checks were conducted on travellers at Changi Airport during that period, against more than 17,000 checks at the other checkpoints."
"Police, SCDF say officers acted appropriately in incident of woman jumping from Eunos HDB block","The authorities are aware of online comments on whether more could have been done to prevent the woman from jumping from height at 36 Eunos Crescent.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-jump-hdb-36-eunos-crescent-police-scdf-respond-2961091,"SINGAPORE: Officers who attended to an incident where a 31-year-old woman jumped from a HDB block at Eunos Crescent had acted appropriately and according to procedures, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Friday (Sep 23).
In a joint news release, the police and SCDF said they were aware of online comments on whether they could have done more to prevent the incident which took place on Tuesday.
The police received a call for assistance at 36 Eunos Crescent at 6.30pm on that day.
“The first pair of police officers arrived at the scene at 6.43pm and proceeded to the unit immediately but the unit was locked,” SPF and SCDF said in the news release.  
A second pair of police officers arrived at 6.44pm and went to the ground floor.
“They saw a woman standing on the ledge of the unit,” said the authorities, adding that other police officers arrived shortly after.
“The officers at the ground floor engaged the woman to try to dissuade her from jumping off the ledge, using both English and her mother tongue.
“However, the woman was not receptive to the attempts by the police officers to calm her down, nor to retreat from the ledge into the unit.”
SCDF was alerted to the incident at 6.43pm, and a Red Rhino vehicle arrived at the scene within eight minutes, followed shortly by a fire engine and an ambulance.
“However, the woman jumped off the ledge at 6.54pm, within minutes of SCDF’s arrival, just when the crew was in the midst of bringing rescue equipment up to the unit and as the safety life air pack was en route to the location,” SPF and SCDF said.
The woman was conveyed conscious to hospital. She was subsequently apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2008, the police said in a response issued to media on Wednesday.
""The police are aware of videos circulating online on the incident and would like to urge members of the public to refrain from circulating the videos and speculating on the case,"" they added then.
On Friday, SPF and SCDF also acknowledged the efforts of two members of the public who had seen the woman on the ledge and tried to engage her before the police arrived.

MAS likely to further tighten monetary policy in response to rising inflation: Analysts,"The monetary policy adopted by MAS will have an effect on the Singapore dollar, which has strengthened against some currencies. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mas-rising-inflation-expected-tighten-monetary-policy-analysts-2960921,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is expected to further tighten monetary policy next month to strengthen the Singapore dollar and counter rising inflation, according to analysts.
Singapore’s core inflation rose again to 5.1 per cent in August, inching towards a 14-year high, official data showed on Friday (Sep 23). The headline consumer price index, or overall inflation, also rose to 7.5 per cent. 
The MAS typically adjusts monetary policy twice a year, in April and October. But in 2022, MAS has tightened policy thrice, once in April and twice in impromptu announcements in January and July.
As inflation is expected to keep rising, “the stage may be set for another tightening”, said OCBC Bank’s chief economist and head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling. 
MUFG Bank’s senior currency analyst Jeff Ng also said he expects inflation to continue to rise, due to “a combination of supply- and demand-side factors”. 
Food inflation, which hit 6.4 per cent in August, is likely to remain high, driven by the cost of meat and fish in particular, said Mr Ng. He added that core inflation components are also likely to face pressures from high input costs. 
MUFG Bank has raised its headline inflation forecast to 6.3 per cent (from 5.5 per cent) in 2022, and core inflation forecast to 4.2 per cent (from 3.5 per cent). 
OCBC Bank’s forecasts of 5.9 per cent for headline inflation and 4.2 per cent for core inflation remain unchanged, Ms Ling said. “But recent developments such as the Russia-Ukraine war escalation and rice export ban by India by imply further upside external price risks in addition to domestic wage pressures,” she added. 
Maybank raised its forecasts slightly, to 4.2 per cent for core inflation (from 4 per cent) and 6.2 per cent for headline inflation (from 6 per cent). This is “to account for the larger than expected pickup in food and services costs”, said Maybank analysts Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye.
The monetary policy adopted by MAS has an effect on the strength of the Singapore dollar.
Unlike most central banks that manage monetary policy through the interest rate, MAS uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool. It lets the exchange rate float within an unspecified policy band, and changes the slope, width and centre of that band when it wants to adjust the pace of appreciation or depreciation of the Singapore dollar.
Analysts said that MAS is highly likely to re-centre the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) to the prevailing level, as it has done before. The S$NEER is currently estimated to be trading at about 1.5 per cent above the implied mid-point, Maybank's analysts said.
Mr Ng said the Singapore dollar is expected to continue to outperform other regional currencies like the Indian rupee, Thai baht and Philippine peso. 
The Singapore dollar has been growing in strength and trading at record levels against several currencies like the Japanese yen. At the start of the year, one Singapore dollar would get you about 85 yen. This has since risen to more than 100 yen. 
Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Thursday to buy yen for the first time since 1998, in an attempt to shore up the battered currency after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stuck with ultra-low interest rates. 
The local currency has been strengthening against the pound as well, as the United Kingdom battles the highest inflation it has seen in 40 years.
At the start of the year, one pound could get above S$1.80. On Friday, that figure was S$1.58.

More beverage containers collected at recycling company’s reverse vending machines,"Collections of beverage containers have roughly doubled at machines in Yuhua Market & Hawker Centre and Pioneer Mall, says ALBA W&H Smart City.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/reverse-vending-machine-beverage-container-deposit-return-scheme-nea-2960941,"SINGAPORE: More beverage containers are being dropped off for recycling at some reverse vending machines in Jurong, said the company behind them.
When the machines were first installed in March 2021, the ones in areas with high footfall received about 300 to 400 cans or bottles per day.
This number has since roughly doubled to about 650 to 700 containers per day, the sustainability manager of ALBA W&H Smart City, Sandra Sajen, told CNA on Friday (Sep 23).
Reverse vending machines may be one of the ways consumers can return their beverage containers when a deposit scheme by the National Environment Agency (NEA) is implemented in 2024.
Under the proposed scheme, those who buy pre-packaged drinks may have to fork out 10 to 20 cents more as a deposit for their beverages as a way to encourage recycling.
They will be able to get their deposit back upon returning the can or bottle to designated return points that have yet to be confirmed.
In the initial stages, it will likely involve only metal cans and plastic bottles.
NEA is in the process of gathering public feedback on matters such as the amount of deposit to be charged and where the beverage containers can be returned.
For ALBA W&H Smart City, the increased recycling rates have prompted the company to up the number of times its machines get cleared to twice a day, said Ms Sajen. 
She added that even then, the company sometimes gets calls from members of the public who find that the machines are full at odd hours of the day.

The company’s five reverse vending machines, which are in the Jurong area, collect an average total of 1,200 cans and bottles per day. The ones located at Yuhua Market & Hawker Centre and Pioneer Mall see higher footfall and are often full, said Ms Sajen. 
Those who recycle their items with ALBA W&H Smart City can redeem their rewards on the company’s mobile app. By collecting 6,000 points, or about 80 containers, users can get a S$2 GrabFood or Grab transport voucher, which can be redeemed once a month. 
This works out to an incentive of about S$0.025 per can, Ms Sajen noted. 
“Even at such a low rate, just 2.5 cents, people are recycling. We have daily users on the app as well … And we see that the take-up rate is already high,” she told CNA.  
“So we really think that when the container return system is implemented and people have to deposit 10 to 20 cents in the beginning, it will really be successful. There’s no doubt about it.”

SOME MACHINES FULL OR JAMMED
Another company that piloted a reverse vending machine initiative is F&N Foods. Encouraged by the results of a trial in 2018, F&N Foods embarked on the Recycle N Save programme with NEA in October 2019, the company said in response to queries from CNA.
When CNA visited Westgate on Wednesday morning, one person was seen attempting to deposit his recyclables at the Recycle N Save machine, which is cleared by ALBA W&H Smart City. After two successful attempts, he walked away with the rest of his cans and bottles as the machine was full.
At Funan mall, 31-year-old Billy Zheng used his lunch break to make a trip to recycle a big bag of cans and bottles at the Recycle N Save machine, which was tucked away near a lift lobby on the third floor. The clearing of this machine is undertaken by CapitaLand.
“This machine is the most available. The biggest problem about this is actually that all the machines are either full or jammed. The ones in town specifically, they’re quite empty,” he told CNA, adding that he often goes to Funan to recycle his cans and bottles.

While he thinks a container return scheme with a deposit on packaging will help to improve recycling rates, people in Singapore may not be happy about it. 
“As a whole, I think our country doesn’t really have a recycling culture yet, especially for the older folks,” he added. 
“I think more importantly, the infrastructure, it has to be there. The biggest turn-off for my family is that every time I go to a machine it’s full. So we really have to have the right infrastructure, the right machines.” 
F&N Foods said on Saturday that while the reverse vending machines are cleared at least once a day on a regular schedule, usage of the machines on the ground is ""dynamic"" and differs from day to day. 
""We work closely with our Recycle N Save scheme partners who track the number of beverage containers collected daily to determine the appropriate clearance schedule for the RVMs (reverse vending machines) and adjust the collection frequency where possible during our reviews.""
F&N Foods did not reply to queries about whether recycling rates at the 50 Recycle N Save machines have increased since they were installed. However, it said it was encouraged by the results of the pilot in 2018. 
“The initiative has shown Singaporeans that recycling is an easy habit to adopt which benefits both them and the environment,” said an F&N Foods spokesperson. 
When the machines were first launched, there were long queues at many of the machines in heartland areas, although these quickly dissipated after the rewards for recycling were reduced.
As part of the scheme, partners like CapitaLand clear the recyclables collected from the reverse vending machines at selected CapitaLand malls and business park properties.
According to F&N Foods, the Recycle N Save initiative also has an agreement with ALBA W&H Smart City. The latter is responsible for clearing the reverse vending machines at IMM, Jurong East Sports Centre, Westgate, Hong Kah North CC, Bukit Gombak Sports Centre and JCube.
Of the 50 Recycle N Save machines, 16 are in CapitaLand malls and properties, and the recyclables are collected daily, said a spokesperson for the developer. 
“Should members of the public encounter a machine that is full or faulty, they may seek help by calling the hotline numbers on the machine,” the CapitaLand spokesperson added. 
Currently, people who use the Recycle N Save machines can choose to redeem 10 CapitaStar STAR$, S$0.50 worth of ActiveSG credits, or a free 30-minute ride with bike rental company anywheel for every 10 containers. 
The CapitaStar STAR$ rewards can then be used to redeem eCapitaVouchers and eDeals for use at CapitaLand malls. 
Editor’s note: This article has been updated to clarify when the Recycle N Save scheme was launched and that it is a joint initiative between F&N and NEA. Details have also been added about the frequency with which machines are cleared and who has responsibility for doing so.

"Singapore could reduce Changi Airport's air-con carbon footprint, in bid to become sustainable air hub","This is part of 15 recommended measures - which include embracing more expensive sustainable aviation fuel - to transform the aviation sector.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-airport-air-con-sustainable-air-hub-2960176,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will consider further reducing the air-conditioning carbon footprint at Changi Airport, and potentially install solar panels near the airport's runway in a concerted push to become a sustainable aviation hub.
These were two of 15 wide-ranging measures across the airport, airline and air traffic management domains recommended by a panel to the Government on Friday (Sep 23), as Singapore looks to ""urgently"" tackle climate change in the local and global aviation sector.
""Any change in the weather can affect, for example, airport infrastructure and in fact how we plan air traffic management as well,"" Professor Chong Tow Chong, chair of the International Advisory Panel on Sustainable Air Hub, told reporters on Friday.
""So I think it's timely that Singapore, being a regional or even a global aviation hub, I think we need to really tackle this issue very urgently.""
The panel was formed in February to discuss how international aviation could be made more sustainable and accessible - and how Singapore could contribute to this effort, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a media release on Friday.

Necessary for Singapore, New Zealand to redouble efforts on sustainable aviation: Iswaran













The panel comprises 20 industry, technology and knowledge partners from Singapore and around the world, including representatives from plane manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus as well as engine maker Rolls-Royce and jet fuel supplier Shell.
Over the past six months, the partners had four meetings and moderated six deep dive sessions with more than 120 local and international representatives from the aviation sector before coming up with the recommendations.
The panel has submitted its report to Transport Minister S Iswaran, detailing ""tangible pathways"" for Singapore to decarbonise the aviation sector, CAAS said. The Government will study the recommendations and include them in a blueprint to be published in 2023.
This blueprint will provide a decarbonisation roadmap for Singapore's air hub, stating medium-term 2030 and longer-term 2050 targets as well as concrete ways of achieving them.
""This will be a significant initiative which will help provide thought leadership and further catalyse investments, actions and collaborations with private sector companies and other countries,"" CAAS said.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Beyond the airport domain, recommendations in the airline and air traffic management domains include stimulating demand and supply for sustainable aviation fuel, and allowing planes to take the most optimal route between destinations to increase fuel efficiency.
But there are bumpy skies ahead. Sustainable aviation fuel remains three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, while air traffic management has long relied on set routes due to technological constraints.
The panel said that decarbonising the aviation sector cannot be achieved by any single country or organisation on its own.
""The push for sustainable aviation will require coordinated state actions, cross-sectoral collaboration, public-private partnership and greater climate consciousness amongst corporates and the travelling public,"" it said.

(Photo: CNA/Aqil Haziq Mahmud)
    






There is no projection yet on the costs of these recommendations, nor a fuller timeline for possible implementation beyond the blueprint.
It is also not clear if some of the airline-based measures - especially the push towards more costly sustainable aviation fuel - could translate to more expensive flights. This needs to be studied as part of the recommendations.
But it is understood that the airport-based measures, including potentially installing more solar panels and setting up a waste-to-energy facility, are not expected to lead to an increase in airport fees and levies for passengers departing Changi Airport, beyond what has already been announced.
CAAS and Changi Airport Group announced on Sep 15 that travellers on flights departing Changi Airport will pay a fee of S$59.20 from Nov 1 to Mar 31, up from the current S$52.30, as the aviation industry continues to recover from the pandemic. 
Authorities said the planned increases were announced in 2018, but suspended due to COVID-19.
The total fee includes a passenger service and security fee; and aviation and airport development levies. The passenger service and security fee will subsequently be increased again in phases from Apr 1, 2023, and Apr 1, 2024.
Prof Chong, the panel chair who is also president of the Singapore University of Technology and Design, acknowledged that many factors will be considered before any talk of implementing the recommendations.
""I think definitely you have cost issues, technology issues and even, for example, data issues and so on,"" he said.
""We need to study carefully. In fact, our recommendation is for MOT (Ministry of Transport) and CAAS to be able to study in more detail because it's not easy for them to come up with solutions.""
Nevertheless the panel believes that its recommendations, taken together, will be ""transformative"" and allow Singapore to distinguish itself as a sustainable air hub.
Mr Iswaran told reporters on Friday evening that the cost of the recommendations should be thought about in the context of ""not even so"" long-term environmental impact, and how this affects people.
""Also, we need to look at the relative competitive landscape, because we need to move in order to ensure the sustainability of our air hub so that we are able to hold our own within the global context,"" he said on the sidelines of a shipping industry event.
Mr Iswaran said climate action is a ""high priority"" around the world and air travellers will scrutinise what different air hubs and airlines are doing to move forward sustainably.
""In that regard, I think, even if it means a little bit of higher costs, it will also have, I think, an important competitive dividend payout,"" he said.
When asked if the Government will offer support for these measures - given that the cost of implementing them could lead to an uneven playing field - Mr Iswaran reiterated that the Government will study the measures first.
""To the extent that there's a cost impact, we need to look at this in terms of how it compares with other aviation hubs around the world,"" he added.
""We will work with the industry to see where we need to get further help from the Government, whether it's in terms of levelling up skills, investing in new kinds of capabilities and innovation.
""(This is) something that we've always done, but it will gather renewed impetus in the context of sustainability.""
Here are all 15 recommendations by the panel:






      Sustainable recommendations for the airport domain. (Infographic: CAAS)
    






      AIRPORT DOMAIN
  

1. Reduce air-conditioning carbon footprint
Changi Airport's air-conditioning system is its largest consumer of energy, making up 60 per cent of the total energy used by its terminals.
While the airport has ongoing initiatives to lower its air-con usage and the energy required to run the system, the panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to further improve the system's energy efficiency through innovative energy-efficient technologies and design concepts.
This includes assessing potential alternative cooling methods or technologies to guide the design for Terminal 5, and retrofitting existing terminals to achieve maximum energy savings.
That said, the airport recognises that its air-con system is an important part of its service to bring comfort to passengers. The airport will not remove air-conditioning entirely, but explore different cooling methods using the space in its terminals.
2. Deploy solar power on airfield
While Changi Airport has already installed solar panels on the rooftops of its terminals, the panel said there is scope to ""significantly increase"" the use of solar energy if solar panels can also be installed on the airfield, including on the grassy verges along taxiways and near the runway.
The solar panels currently supply only 4 per cent of the airport's total energy use.
The panel recommended that CAAS conduct a technical study on the feasibility of deploying solar panels on the airfield, include assessing their impact on radar signals, flight operations, energy yields, transmission losses and economic viability.
For instance, the reflective nature of solar panels could disrupt a pilot's landing view, while debris kicked up from a landing plane could damage nearby panels.
If shown to be viable, CAAS will engage the International Civil Aviation Organization and other industry bodies on standards and implementation.
3. Increase use of renewable electricity
Building on the previous measure involving solar power, the panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to secure imported low-carbon electricity for Changi Airport and set medium-term 2030 and longer-term 2050 targets for the use of renewable electricity.
The Energy Market Authority has issued requests for proposals to bring low-carbon electricity into Singapore, amid its target of importing 4 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2035 to decarbonise the country's power sector.
In the long term, there is potential for the aviation sector to tap on new domestic renewable energy production initiatives such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage, or the use of hydrogen.
4. Make all airside vehicles run on clean energy
Changi Airport currently has a fleet of up to 3,000 airside vehicles, including tow trucks, catering trucks and luggage carts. The airport has electrified about 10 per cent of them, mostly the smaller vehicles.
The panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to facilitate the transition of all airside vehicles towards cleaner energy options.
This can be achieved through three pathways: Electrification of the airside fleet, conversion to hydrogen-powered vehicles and the use of biofuels.
Authorities should conduct a simulation and modelling study, along with technology trials, to better understand the deployment scale, operational challenges, policies and regulations needs for each pathway, the panel said.
5. Set up waste-to-energy facility at Changi Airport
Changi Airport has been adopting circular waste practices to reduce the volume of waste generated and consume less external resources.
Beyond this, the panel recommended a more direct decarbonisation pathway to reduce energy consumption, through an on-site waste-to-energy facility at Changi Airport.
The facility could work by channelling waste - including from arriving planes - as feedstock to generate biofuels or electricity.
CAAS should work with stakeholders to study the potential and feasibility of establishing such a facility, particularly whether there are sufficient economies of scale for such a facility, the panel said.
Authorities should also look into who would operate the facility, the kind of waste streams involved and potential disamenities that could arise.
6. Optimise airport operations
System optimisation at the airport level can improve operational efficiency and reduce carbon emissions systemically, the panel said.
Changi Airport could benefit from developing a digital model that integrates data from various sources to mirror its actual airport operations. This can then be presented in a human-centric interface for advanced predictions, simulation and process optimisation.
The panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to study the feasibility of a digital twin modelling process at Changi Airport.
The study should include planning, design and end-to-end optimisation of airport processes to reduce energy consumption and minimise emissions from aircraft and airside vehicle movements.

      AIRLINE DOMAIN
  

7. Implement roadmap to secure long-term supply of sustainable aviation fuel
The global sustainable aviation fuel market and its production remain nascent, the panel said, stressing the need to boost availability and affordability of the fuel.
Therefore, Changi Airport needs to develop a long-term secured supply in Singapore and the region so more airlines can adopt these fuels, it said.
This entails building up and strengthening the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain and upstream capabilities to establish an ecosystem in Singapore and the region.
Authorities should also invest in new sustainable aviation fuel pathways; explore potential sources of feedstock and align these with global standards, said the panel.
In July, Changi Airport's fuel hydrant system delivered for the first time a blend of sustainable aviation fuel to departing Singapore Airlines and Scoot flights, in a pilot involving CAAS, Singapore Airlines and a Temasek-owned investment platform.
Under this pilot, 1,000 tonnes of neat sustainable aviation fuel would be supplied by oil refining company Neste and blended with refined jet fuel at ExxonMobil’s facilities in Singapore. This is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,500 tonnes, CAAS said in a statement then.
8. Establish ""buyers' club"" of sustainable aviation fuel to create demand
Long-term demand certainty is required to incentivise sustainable aviation fuel suppliers to expand production capacity, the panel said, adding that there is scope to increase demand signals in Singapore.
The panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to establish a Singapore or regional buyers’ club to encourage early adopters of sustainable air travel to take collective action, thereby aggregating sustainable aviation fuel demand and providing stronger demand signals.
""As a global business and logistics hub, Singapore has opportunities to tap on business travellers and air cargo users and encourage them to become first movers by joining the corporate buyers’ club,"" the panel said.
Following this, there is also the potential of collaborating with regional partners to expand the buyers’ club to the broader ASEAN region.
9. Introduce offtake mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel
To create long-term, predictable demand for sustainable aviation fuel, Changi Airport needs to introduce and implement a structural mechanism to encourage sustained adoption among airlines.
The panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to design and introduce a structural offtake mechanism that encourages a self-sustaining ecosystem and flow of funds for sustainable aviation fuel in Singapore.
Major airlines generally have offtake agreements with a range of sustainable aviation fuel suppliers to ensure enough feedstock is available for their needs.
For instance, Delta Air Lines in September signed an offtake agreement with DG Fuels to be supplied with 385 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel from 2026, one of several such agreements it has.
Changi Airport's offtake mechanism needs to consider the unique context and characteristics of the air hub, its airlines and passengers, the funding sources and the metrics used to determine the mechanism, the panel said.
10. Build carbon offset market in aviation sector
To support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector, the panel said there is scope to build a market for aviation carbon offsets, in order to achieve net-zero emissions.
The panel recommended that CAAS work with key players in Singapore’s emerging global carbon services hub to build up the market for aviation carbon offsets.
This includes innovating products and platforms for aviation carbon offsets; developing an ecosystem of carbon support services to improve the reliability, traceability and accountability of aviation industry offsets; and exploring the possibility of raising voluntary demand for carbon offsets among corporates, passengers and cargo users.
11. Ensure Singapore is early adopter of aircraft technology
Singapore would need to remain at the forefront of advancements in aviation technology to reap their full benefits, the panel said.
It recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders to explore setting up a technical centre in Singapore to tap on the country's strong research and development ecosystem.
The centre could collaborate with aircraft original equipment manufacturers, like-minded aviation partners and stakeholders to strengthen its technical capabilities and position itself for the future.
This initiative complements existing efforts to explore the potential use of hydrogen at Changi Airport, the panel said.

      Sustainable recommendations for the air traffic management domain. (Infographic: CAAS)
    






      AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT DOMAIN
  

12. Implement advanced demand-capacity balancing
CAAS has been working with stakeholders to improve the management of air traffic alongside the capacity of Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP).
The panel recommended that CAAS work with stakeholders and partner ANSPs to build on these efforts and introduce advanced demand-capacity balancing initiatives.
These include implementing long-range air traffic flow management to improve coordination and management of longer-haul flights.
However, this is challenging as long-range flights cross multiple flight information regions and are managed by multiple ANSPs, making international collaboration crucial.
Additionally, authorities could strengthen integration between meteorology and air traffic management by conducting translational studies of the impact of weather on air traffic management operations, the panel said.
13. Make airplanes descend continuously
Planes typically descend intermittently before landing at an airport to avoid traffic and weather, but this results in more fuel burn and carbon emissions.
Performance-based navigation initiatives can enable more direct routings and optimise descent profiles for aircraft, making flights greener.
CAAS has conducted operational trials for direct route operations for flights arriving at Changi Airport and is facilitating continuous descent operation when traffic permits.
The panel recommended that CAAS expand on these initiatives by formalising the implementation of direct route operations for Changi arrivals on specific route segments, to provide airlines with the flexibility to plan for the most optimal route in terms of flight and fuel efficiency.
""Smart tools"" should also be developed to facilitate continuous descent operations into Changi Airport, it added.
14. Optimise efficiency during all phases of flight
CAAS has been closely following global advancements that can optimise efficiency during all phases of flight.
This includes trajectory-based operations, where authorities plan flight trajectories ahead of time and execute them more precisely to improve the management of traffic flows, instead of relying heavily on tactical air traffic control.
To optimise runway efficiency, aircraft wake turbulence categories can also be reclassified to reduce separation between aircraft. 
The panel recommended that CAAS collaborate with stakeholders and partner ANSPs to advance these initiatives, optimising the journey from one airport gate to another and increase fuel savings. 
This includes implementing various systems that define the standards, infrastructure and governance concerning the management and sharing of air navigation information.
15. Implement free route airspace
A more medium-term measure, expected to be realised between 2027 and 2032, is the implementation of trajectory-based operations and a free route airspace, in collaboration with stakeholders and partner ANSPs.
A free route airspace allows pilots to choose their most optimal route between destinations, as opposed to the standard practice of following set waypoints designed to organise air traffic and ensure safety.
This advanced concept of operation, made possible with advancements in technology, could revolutionise air traffic management, optimise efficiency and reduce carbon emissions from flights, the panel said.
However, it would require substantial investment in various technology.
The panel recommended that CAAS collaborate with partner ANSPs to conduct demonstrations for such concepts, further developing their ""key building blocks"".

"Cross Island Line, residential development works at Turf City to begin after tenants' lease ends in Dec 2023","The Cross Island Line station at Turf City is among six new stations slated to open in 2032. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/turf-city-cross-island-line-mrt-residential-tenants-lease-dec-2023-2960841,"SINGAPORE: Works on the new Cross Island Line (CRL) station at Turf City as well as preparations for the future residential development at the site will begin progressively after the tenants’ lease ends on Dec 31, 2023, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Friday (Sep 23).
Transport Minister S Iswaran announced on Tuesday that six more stations on the Cross Island Line will be opened in 2032.
The stations are Turf City, King Albert Park, Maju, Clementi, West Coast and Jurong Lake District, forming Phase 2 of the Cross Island Line.  
The Cross Island Line is Singapore's eighth MRT line and the longest fully underground line at more than 50km. It will be constructed in three phases.
The station at Turf City will improve public transport accessibility and connectivity for the area, said SLA and URA in a joint release on Friday.
“The redevelopment of brownfield sites such as Turf City will allow the Government to make optimal use of the land and transport infrastructure,” they added.
Brownfield sites include golf courses and industrial areas with expiring leases.
The authorities said detailed technical studies such as environmental and heritage studies are being carried out to ensure that any development at Turf City will be sensitively integrated with its surrounding environment.
“Where feasible, we will retain and integrate key existing natural and heritage elements into the future master plan for the area,” they added.
Agencies will also engage with relevant stakeholders to share more about the plans for the site and seek their feedback when ready, authorities said.

RESIDENTIAL USE
Turf City in Bukit Timah has been slated for residential use since the 1998 Master Plan.
“This is to cater to future housing demand and provide a variety of housing choices in terms of location, density mix and forms to meet the diverse housing needs and aspirations of Singaporeans,” SLA and URA said.
Last September, tenants at Turf City were given a final 18-month extension of their lease until end of 2023.
In the news release on Friday, SLA and URA reminded tenants that no further extension will be granted as the site is required for future residential development.
Turf City, which has been managed by SLA since 1999, is currently occupied by 15 tenants for various uses including retail, F&B, sports and recreation, childcare centres and motor vehicle showrooms.
The original tenancies for these interim uses were for periods up to Dec 31, 2020.
Since 2019, there have been two successive 18-month tenancy extensions to give tenants more time to firm up their transition and winding down plans, said SLA and URA.
“This provided most Turf City tenants with around a four-year lead time to plan their transition,” they added.
Agencies have already been engaging tenants to assist them in firming up their transition plans and will continue to engage them closely and share information on available sites for open tender, the authorities said.
All tenants can consider participating in open tenders for state land or properties, taking into account the final lease deadline in making their transition plans.
SLA said that it will also work closely with tenants on the return of state land or properties at the Turf City site on or before the Dec 31, 2023 deadline.
Last year, one of the tenants, Bukit Timah Saddle Club was asked to return an area of about 0.8ha from the first half of 2023.
The 0.8ha area within the club's premises is needed for a worksite to support tunnelling works for the Cross Island Line, SLA and URA had said."
Couple say 'I do' in Singapore’s first metaverse wedding,"Avatars dancing the night away in the couple’s themed 1970s disco glam metaverse wedding were all customised, from their personalities to their retro outfits.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/metaverse-wedding-sandbox-virtual-reality-singapore-first-2960256,"SINGAPORE: Avatars clapped and cheered as the digital likeness of Mr Clarence Chan and Ms Joanne Tham sealed their vows with a kiss at a virtual altar during their metaverse wedding – in what they say is the first of its kind in Singapore.
Family and friends, the wedding officiator, and even the bride’s pet dog, were present in pixel form – and also in physical form – at the couple’s hybrid wedding this month that straddled both the physical and digital worlds.
“We actually met in real life,” laughed Mr Chan, when asked if the couple met virtually. “We had this idea of a crossover because we wanted to create scenes that both reflect and exceed what we can do in (real life).”

Mr Chan said this is the first wedding held on decentralised virtual world The Sandbox, and the couple marked the happy occasion by planting the Singapore flag in their digital wedding venue.
“We were the first in the world to do this in The Sandbox and just like Neil Armstrong, we wanted to plant the Singapore flag, being proud Singaporeans ourselves,” said Mr Chan.
AVATARS, SUPER TREES, 1970S DISCO
Avatars dancing the night away in the couple’s themed 1970s disco glam wedding were all customised, from their personalities to their retro outfits.
















“What’s exciting in the metaverse wedding, is that you're not limited to coming in your physical human form or wearing typical clothing. You can come as alien, a robot, a polar bear… the possibilities are endless,” Mr Chan said. 
The wedding venue was decorated with super trees, a Cinderella horse-drawn carriage, and a giant calligraphy sign of the word ""xi"", a Chinese character commonly seen at Chinese weddings meaning ""double happiness"". 
Ms Tham walked down the aisle at the virtual location – a digital recreation of popular wedding venue The Alkaff Mansion on Telok Blangah Hill.
The mansion’s distinctive architecture and recognisable key features like its garden conservatory, European-style water fountains, and broad balustrade stairways were brought to life in their digital forms by design agency Smobler Studios.
The agency said that with the metaverse, celebrations are no longer limited by physical presence or by distance.
""We are thrilled at being able to create Singapore's first ever metaverse wedding ... allowing friends, family and loved ones from afar to join in the celebrations across the globe,"" said co-founder Ms Loretta Chen.















The groom, whose avatar was seen performing a breakdancing sequence during the wedding, said that digital space offers infinite creativity and unique experiences, limited only by imagination.
“Web3 allows us to give things like attendance passes, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which allow us to offer token-gated utilities like VIP access areas or special badges … this kind of enhances the overall wedding experience.”
FRIENDS, FAMILY, WIFE ONBOARD
The couple said that while they still had to hold a conventional physical wedding at a hotel for their aunts and uncles, most of their friends and families were excited at the idea of the metaverse nuptial. 
“The concept was very well received by our guests. I think many are truly excited because this is their first time attending a wedding that combines both physical and virtual metaverse elements,” said Ms Tham.

The bride herself needed no persuading. Ms Tham said that while the virtual wedding was a passion project of Mr Chan’s due to his interest in crypto and the metaverse, she was thrilled to see their physical wedding transformed into virtual reality.
“We’re really excited because we were able to replicate aspects of our wedding onto the metaverse, from our vows to the attendees, right down to the outfits,” the bride said. “We even managed to create a version of my designer gown!”

“THE SKY IS NO LONGER THE LIMIT”
Events and virtual reality businesses said they foresee opportunities for metaverse events, mainly because the digital world offers experiences that are impossible in real life.
“The charm of the metaverse is really about having something where traditional weddings cannot,” said Ms Jessie Tan, marketing representative of The Alkaff Mansion.
“We are exploring merely the tip of the iceberg with this inaugural wedding (by Clarence and Joanne). We cannot wait to see what other couples decide to create in time to come, be it a fairy tale, gravity-defying bohemian, Star Wars inspired or Bridgerton wedding,” Ms Chen said.
“Even the sky is no longer the limit with the open metaverse,"" she said."
"Lim Tean given two more charges, accused of refusing to answer police and pocketing S$5,500",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lim-tean-given-two-more-charges-accused-refusing-answer-police-and-pocketing-s5500-2960596,"SINGAPORE: Lawyer and politician Lim Tean has been given two more charges for refusing to answer a police officer and committing criminal breach of trust as an attorney.
Lim, 57, was on Friday (Sep 23) given one new charge of dishonestly misappropriating a sum of S$5,500 paid by AXA Insurance, therefore committing criminal breach of trust during his business as an attorney.
According to charge sheets, the money was a settlement sum belonging to a woman, that he allegedly pocketed around Apr 3, 2020.
Lim was handed a second fresh charge of refusing to answer a public servant authorised to question. He allegedly refused to answer questions on Jun 10, 2022, at the Commercial Affairs Department about the facts and circumstances of a case involving US$50,000 a person had paid to him in October 2017.
This brings the total number of charges Lim faces to seven. He was previously charged with criminal breach of trust for misappropriating S$30,000 that was entrusted to him in late 2019, that was a sum awarded to a former client as a settlement in a civil suit.
Lim also faces three charges of being an unauthorised person who acted as an advocate or solicitor.
He is also suspected of preparing documents and instruments relating to court proceedings on 33 occasions, acting as an advocate or solicitor when he did not have a valid practising certificate.
Lim also faces an unlawful stalking charge for allegedly harassing an ex-employee of his law firm.
He is set to return to court for a pre-trial conference in October."
Five on Friday: 5 types of MRT passengers we don't want to cross the island with,"In CNA's regular look at what hit the headlines during the week, Five on Friday closes in on some MRT passengers we see on our daily commute. Who are worst? 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/five-friday-mrt-worst-types-passengers-cross-island-line-2956801,"SINGAPORE: With news that six more stations on the Cross Island Line (CRL) will open in about 10 years, commuters in the west - particularly West Coast area - are cheering that they will eventually get better connectivity.
However, this is not the time and space to stoke the flames of the great East side vs West side debate (spoiler alert - it's the East, by the way) or espouse the great merits of Singapore having more MRT lines and stations.
Instead, if you frequently do the commute, you'll notice that there are certain types of passengers - some who make the journey way more difficult than it has to be. 
Here are five types of MRT passengers I would loathe to share a cabin with. 
THE FBI AGENT

Don't look to your left too quickly, but someone's also reading this article with y-
Okay, now they're pretending they weren't staring.
You know this type of passenger well. I call them The FBI Agent. 
These are the people who think they're being discreet while they get all kaypoh (read - nosey) about what you're browsing on your phone, stealing all-too-long glances while you're stalking your celebrity crush, or complaining about your boss to a colleague. 
Here's a tip: Either get a privacy screen protector for your phone or turn to them and say, ""Get your own phone out and read this article for free, this news site doesn't have a paywall.""
THE CHILD ATHLETE

Screaming children in a restaurant? Sure we have seen them around.
How about children swinging on the MRT handrails?
Meet The Child Athlete.
We've seen some gymnast wannabes begging their parents to lift them up to the handrails, parkour enthusiasts sprinting and weaving their way through already packed cabins - what are you, Robin the Boy Wonder?
The last I checked, the MRT isn't a Government Approved™ exercise venue.
So why are parents allowing their kids to practise for their National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test in the MRT cabins? 
For the other commuters' sake, I implore you to take your energy somewhere else.
THE MOBILE DJ

Yes, we get it - your music is straight fire - but so is mine, and I'm not interested in your poorly curated Spotify playlist.
There are two subtypes of The Mobile DJ - first, those who crank up their music so loud that the entire cabin can hear the latest hits through their lousy earphones.
Don't bother complaining, they can't hear you protesting over their ruptured eardrums anyway. It's 2022, cheap noise-cancelling earphones exist, and they help me as much as they can help you.
The second - those who watch videos out loud.
I find it really strange that people think it is okay to share their videos with everyone else in the cabin. These days, most clips have captions so if you aren't carrying any earphones, just read the text. 
Or bookmark it and watch it in your private space. Thank you. 
THE SENIOR OLYMPIAN






      (Photo: iStock)
    






I am in favour of giving up seats to the elderly on public transport and keeping them safe while the bus or train is moving.
But there is also a special group of seniors who will not stay in line and push their way to the front of the queue just before the doors open.
They crash through those who are trying to disembark like wildebeests on the run, and charge towards the priority seats.
These are the people who put the Active in Active Ageing and the Movement into Singapore Kindness Movement.
Bonus points if you spot one who proceeds to complain loudly about youngsters not being gracious towards them after they showcase their feats of strength and agility.
Uncle, auntie, nobody is rushing for those seats. Singaporeans are a relatively decent bunch and will give up their seats to you guys, priority or not - so can you please be more polite about it? 
SIR STAMFORD RAFFLES






      Sir Stamford Raffles statue by the Singapore River. (Photo: iStock)
    






Picture this: It's peak rush hour, and people are surging in and out of the cabins at every stop. Your train pulls into the station, and the nice lady who does the train announcements requests that you stand clear of the doors. The doors whoosh open, and the legion surges forward - however, the unstoppable force suddenly meets an immovable object. 
Like Moses parting the Red Sea, a stalwart protector of That Very Spot Near The Middle Of The Train Doors stands firm, unwavering, against the masses who ... just want to get out of the train.
Say hello to Sir Stamford Raffles. 
No, not the actual British statesman, but the immovable white polymarble statue at the Singapore River.
If you are guilty of being this person, please be kind and move along like the rest of us. Otherwise be prepared to face an unforgiving scrum. 
Sorry, not sorry.

"Man wanted to be paid for attending court during wife's lawsuit against PUB, court rejects him",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-wanted-be-paid-attendance-court-sim-kwang-jui-chan-hui-peng-lawsuit-against-pub-manhole-costs-court-2960326,"SINGAPORE: A court has rejected the payment claims of a man who wanted to be compensated for his time for accompanying his wife to court for her lawsuit against PUB.
His wife, Ms Chan Hui Peng, had sued PUB for S$5 million after falling into an open manhole.
The trial was set for two weeks in November 2020, but Ms Chan accepted an undisclosed settlement offer by PUB on the fourth day.
Ms Chan's husband, Mr Sim Kwang Jui, accompanied her to and from court for the four trial days. He had been subpoenaed by PUB as a witness, but his attendance as a witness was scheduled for the second week, so he never attended court as a witness.
In a judgment issued on Friday (Sep 23), Justice Andre Maniam detailed how Mr Sim sought payment from PUB for attending court on the first day of trial.
He asked for S$34.59 for transport and meal expenses, providing receipts, and S$750 for a day's worth of work. He said he earned S$14,700 a month.
PUB said it was not obliged to pay Mr Sim anything, but the board's lawyers from WhiteFern LLC said they could advise PUB to pay for the transport and meal expenses of S$34.59. Mr Sim did not want this offer.
He said he would be referring the issue of other subpoena fees on his first day of attendance in court to the Law Society of Singapore, but WhiteFern told him this was not the proper forum.
Mr Sim complained to LawSoc anyway, claiming that PUB's lawyers had ""cheated"" him out of payment for attending court on the first day. His complaint was dismissed.
Mr Sim then filed a claim in the Small Claims Tribunals against WhiteFern. He raised his claim to S$3,815.09 and alleged that he had a contract with WhiteFern for the provision of services for that sum. He claimed that those services were for his court attendance as a subpoenaed witness. At this point, he had increased his claim from one day's worth of court attendance to five days.
The Small Claims Tribunals dismissed Mr Sim's claim. At this point, PUB offered Mr Sim S$1,000 to settle the matter, according to court documents.
However, he turned it down and said he would file a lawsuit if he was not paid S$3,932.93 and complained to the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.
PUB then wrote to the trial judge, Justice Maniam, to resolve the issue of whether Mr Sim should be paid for being subpoenaed by PUB. By this time, Mr Sim's claims had risen to S$7,826.28.
This amount included claims for his unsuccessful complaints and claims to LawSoc and the Small Claims Tribunals, and a claim for his time in writing to court.
PUB, LAWYERS NOT OBLIGED TO PAY HIM
Justice Maniam said in his full grounds of decision on Friday that neither PUB nor its lawyers were obliged to pay Mr Sim anything for the subpoena.
""Mr Sim went to court because he was accompanying his wife, the plaintiff. He was not attending court on the subpoena, he was not complying with an order to attend court, and he did not incur time and expenses in complying with the subpoena for which he ought reasonably to be compensated,"" said the judge.
He pointed that Mr Sim intended to attend his wife's trial even before the subpoena was served on him. 
He mentioned his original intention to follow his wife's trial proceedings and ""watch after and take care"" of her during the trial, but complained that he was deprived of his privilege and satisfaction of using his leave to sit in the court hearing to follow the proceeding.
This was because he was subpoenaed as a witness and asked to leave the courtroom while other witnesses testified, as he was a material factual witness.
He had applied for leave from his job on Nov 12, 2020 and it was approved that same day. Three days later, PUB's lawyers served the subpoena on him.
Even before the trial commenced, Mr Sim had written to WhiteFern to ask about the issue of payment for his attendance as a witness. He told the law firm that he needed to apply leave in order to attend court, but did not tell the firm that he had already secured the leave for the first week of trial.
""Mr Sim has spent the better part of two years pursuing payment that he is not entitled to,"" concluded Justice Maniam. ""He should stop chasing after the wind."""
Man accused of killing 79-year-old partner says he wants death sentence but disputes facts,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pak-kian-huat-man-accused-killing-79-year-old-partner-chopper-wants-death-sentence-disputes-facts-2960251,"SINGAPORE: An 85-year-old man accused of hacking his 79-year-old partner to death with a chopper was unable to have his guilty plea for culpable homicide go through on Friday (Sep 23), after he made numerous objections to the statement of facts.
Pak Kian Huat was originally charged with the murder of Madam Lim Soi Moy, 79, in a flat at Block 191, Lorong 4 Toa Payoh in September 2019.
A hearing was convened on Friday for Pak to plead guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
According to the statement of facts read out in court, Pak had four children with Mdm Lim after meeting her when they were both teenagers. However, they never officially married.
He is accused of hacking Mdm Lim to death with a chopper after a dispute with her over which rooms they stayed in in the flat.
Pak made numerous loud objections while the Mandarin interpreter was reading out the statement of facts to him.
He first disputed that it was not true that there was a lot of blood. 
Later, when the interpreter read out the bit in the statement of facts that said 54 wounds were found on the deceased, Pak exclaimed: ""I don't admit. There aren't so many. There weren't so many wounds.""
At this, Justice Aedit Abdullah told him: ""This is the medical officer counting the wounds. Are you saying you counted the wounds after you stabbed your 'wife'?""
Pak replied: ""How will I go and count them, but I reckon I'm not that capable.""
When asked how he knew the number of wounds inflicted was not 54, Pak laughed. ""I can't possibly have killed her so skilfully. I stopped when I saw her stop breathing,"" he said.
The judge then told Pak, whose lawyers discharged themselves earlier that same morning, that if he did not admit the facts, he could not accept the guilty plea.
He would then have to go to trial for the original charge of murder, which is punishable with death.
Pak replied: ""Fine, death penalty.""
When he objected again at another section of the statement of facts, Justice Abdullah told him in a raised voice: ""I have been very patient with you. You will behave in court. You are not in a coffee shop, you are not in any other place, you are in a courtroom, you will behave with proper decorum, you understand?""
He adjourned the hearing for a decision to be made on whether the original murder charge will be restored, or if a Newton hearing has to be convened to settle the disputed information in the current plea offer.
A Newton hearing is done to settle certain issues that both defence and prosecution are unable to agree on."
"DBS, UOB temporarily remove fixed rate home loans amid ongoing review","Banks have been making revisions to their home loan rates this year as global central banks embark on a rate-hike race to tame inflation.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dbs-temporarily-removes-fixed-rate-mortgage-home-loans-2960066,"SINGAPORE: At least two Singapore banks – DBS and UOB – have temporarily stopped offering fixed rate home loans as of Friday (Sep 23).
DBS, Singapore’s largest lender, has removed fixed rate home loans from its website. CNA understands that the local bank is currently reviewing its rates.
UOB said in response to queries that amid a rising rate environment, it is reviewing its fixed rate offerings and will be ceasing its existing two-year and three-year packages.
The US Federal Reserve announced a 75-basis-point increase in its benchmark federal-funds rate on Wednesday, mirroring similarly hefty increases in June and July. 
Lenders have been making revisions to their home loan rates this year, as global central banks embark on a rate-hike race to tame inflation.
Fixed rate packages have seen bigger adjustments. Some foreign banks suspended fixed rate options earlier in the year due to the rising cost of funds.
DBS was previously offering two-year and three-year mortgage loans that carried a fixed rate of 2.75 per annum.
The bank still has floating rate home loans – pegged to either the benchmark Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) or the bank’s six-month average fixed deposit rate – with the lending margins unchanged since its last revision in June.
Likewise, UOB continues to offer a floating rate package that is pegged to the three-month compounded SORA plus a margin of 1 per cent, with a two-year lock-in. It also has an ongoing promotion where new customers get to enjoy the floating rate package at a lower margin of 0.7 per cent for the first two years.
“We are continuously monitoring market conditions and will review our home loan packages to ensure they remain competitive and have a range of options to meet the unique needs of homeowners,” said the spokesperson.
“As buying a property is a long-term commitment and a big-ticket item, homeowners should be aware of the costs, risks and the terms of their home loan. We strongly encourage homeowners to speak with their banks as early as possible to better understand how changes in interest rates will affect their home loans, the steps they can take to mitigate any adverse risk and select a loan package that best suits his or her situation.”
Over at OCBC, mortgage offerings seem to be left untouched as of Friday noon.
The bank still offers a two-year fixed rate package at 2.98 per cent per annum, alongside floating rate packages pegged to the one-month or three-month compounded SORA plus a per-annum lending margin of 0.98 per cent.
“We review our mortgage pricing regularly and ensure that our pricing packages remain competitive. As interest rates are now on the increasing trend, we advise consumers to review their affordability before committing to their home purchase,” said the bank’s head of consumer secured lending Phang Lah Hwa.

FAQ: What home owners in Singapore need to know after another Fed rate hike



















CNA Explains: Where are mortgage rates in Singapore headed and what should home owners do?













PropertyGuru Group’s vice-president of PropertyGuru Finance Paul Wee said banks in Singapore “seem to be treading carefully” around their fixed rate packages and are opting for a “wait-and-see” approach.
""Existing packages are now scheduled to be taken off the shelf, with no replacement packages yet. Floating rate packages are still being maintained,"" he added.
The latest announcement by the US Fed marks its fifth rate hike this year, with further increases likely to rein in decades-high inflation. 
“The recent rate hike was expected, as the Fed had signalled that they are going to continue being hawkish until the inflation numbers turn and start trending down,” said Mr Wee.
Rate hikes by the Fed will translate into upward pressure on interest rates in Singapore, given how Singapore is an “interest-rate taker”, experts have said.
For example, the three-month compounded SORA has risen from 0.1949 at the start of the year to 1.9009 as of Sep 23.
“With further upward adjustments in short-term Singapore-dollar interest rates to keep pace with the hawkish Fed, there could be more pressure emerging on property mortgage rates and refinancing costs for corporates going out into year-end and into early 2023,” said OCBC’s chief economist and head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling."
"Singapore's core inflation rises to 5.1% in August, inching towards 14-year high",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-core-inflation-august-cpi-food-services-2959851,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's core inflation rose further to 5.1 per cent in August, driven mainly by stronger increases in the prices of food and services, official data showed on Friday (Sep 23).
This is higher than the 4.8 per cent in July as the inflation figure inches towards a 14-year high.
The last time Singapore reported higher year-on-year core inflation growth was in November 2008, when it stood at 5.5 per cent.
Core inflation excludes accommodation and private transport costs. The August figure of 5.1 per cent was slightly higher than a Reuters forecast of 5 per cent.
The headline consumer price index, or overall inflation, rose to 7.5 per cent year-on-year in August, surpassing the 7 per cent reported in July.
""The rise in headline inflation largely reflected higher private transport inflation, in addition to the pickup in core inflation,"" said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a joint media release.
OVERALL INFLATION INCREASES
Overall inflation increased in August mainly due to higher inflation for private transport, food and services.
Food inflation came in higher due to steeper increases in the prices of both food services and non-cooked food, hitting 6.4 per cent in August.
Accommodation inflation also picked up alongside a faster pace of increase in housing rents, hitting 4.7 per cent in August.
Services inflation rose to 3.8 per cent in August as the cost of holiday expenses saw a larger increase.
Private transport inflation rose to 24.1 per cent from 22.2 per cent in July due to a stronger pickup in car prices.
Prices of retail and other goods also registered a faster pace of increase, coming in at 2.9 per cent in August, as inflation for household durables and clothing and footwear edged up.
Meanwhile, inflation for electricity and gas dipped to 23.9 per cent in August, compared with 24 per cent in July, on the back of a smaller increase in gas prices.
For the full year, overall inflation is expected to come in at 5 per cent to 6 per cent, while MAS core inflation is projected to average at 3 per cent to 4 per cent.
""Fresh shocks to global commodity prices, as well as domestic wage pressures remain as upside risks to inflation,"" said the authorities.

SUPPLY CHAIN FRICTIONS EASE SLIGHTLY
Globally, supply chain frictions have eased slightly and some commodity prices have levelled off, MAS and MTI said.
But they added that global inflation is likely to stay elevated in the near term as key commodity markets continue to face supply constraints and labour markets in many major economies remain tight.
Additionally, the recovery in domestic demand in some regional economies as COVID-19 restrictions are eased could lead to higher inflation in these economies. Upward pressures on Singapore’s import prices could therefore persist.
""On the domestic front, the labour market remains tight, keeping wage growth strong,"" MAS and MTI said.
""Amid firm consumer spending, businesses are likely to pass on increases in labour costs and the prices of fuel, utilities and other imported inputs to consumer prices.""

CNA Explains: How the Russia-Ukraine war drove up LNG prices and what this means for Singapore,"As the war in Ukraine drags on, LNG prices will remain elevated, say analysts. How will Singapore be affected and are there viable energy alternatives?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lng-prices-rising-ukraine-invasion-russia-gas-impact-singapore-asia-2957781,"SINGAPORE: Global energy markets have been impacted by Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a military mobilisation, sending prices higher and threatening to tighten fuel supplies even further.
The war in Ukraine has already made goods and commodities more expensive around the world, with everything from fuel to food and even paper affected.
And as winter approaches with Russian gas supplies restricted for ""unfriendly"" countries, a scramble is under way in Europe to secure more liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The impact of this increased demand is evident in the price of LNG exports from the United States, which has increased by close to 70 per cent since the start of the year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
What are the knock-on effects on Singapore and other countries in the region? CNA spoke to energy analysts to find out.
What is LNG and why is it growing in importance?
LNG is natural gas that is stored and transported in liquid form at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of -162 degrees Celsius, according to Singapore's Energy Market Authority (EMA).
Liquefying natural gas reduces its volume by 600 times, making it easier to store and transport. LNG is transported in purpose-built tanks by double-hulled ships and must be re-gasified for use once it reaches its destination.
This is in contrast to natural gas delivered by pipes, which Europe has been heavily reliant on.
""Europe has been quite reliant on Russian pipe gas up to (the first half) of this year,"" said Mr Alex Siow, lead Asia gas analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).
""When this source of gas was halted – or severely reduced – Europe had no choice but to rely on LNG to replace Russia's pipe gas.""
Domestic production and pipe imports from other countries such as Norway, Algeria and Azerbaijan could not be increased to levels that would make up for the lost Russian gas, he added.

Why are prices rising?
This new-found need for LNG has sent prices on an upward trajectory.
""LNG demand has grown exponentially in light of the decrease and ultimate shutdown of Russian supplies to Europe, as it was a main source of energy historically,"" said Trident LNG's global head of trading and advisory Toby Copson.
""As such, with Europe's demand increasing, this has taken spot availability away from Asian participants, who have ramped up procurement.""
He added: ""Prices have consistently gone up, in line with a supply shortage and tight market; with Europe bidding against Asia, prices have and will remain at very elevated levels.""
Mr Siow explained how Europe came to rely on spot LNG.
""The way the LNG supply works is that you have to contract it quite early as the financing of LNG projects is backed by long-term buyers. Thus, Europe has to turn to spot LNG – that is, leftover LNG cargoes that are uncommitted to any buyers,"" he said.
""And because these spot LNG cargoes are very limited, Europe's demand quickly ended up (placing it) in a price war with all other countries that have been using spot LNG all along. Spot LNG prices quadrupled in a matter of months.""
Europe's demand for spot LNG shows no sign of abating, Mr Siow added.
""We see no sign that Europe is slowing down in trying to buy up as much spot LNG as possible, though its gas storage level is decent,"" he said.
""LNG is used (as) a heating fuel in northern hemisphere countries, so there is always a seasonal spike as we go closer into (the) year-end. North Asia and Europe are the nations that will need it most during winter months.
""The spot prices are generally climbing higher as we go into winter months, but it is also pretty volatile depending on certain events, for example, Russia further reducing the flowrate of existing pipes.""
The effect of Europe's demand for LNG is already visible in Asia, said Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Asti Nuraini Asra.
""Europe's LNG demand has surged as the region seeks to replace lower Russian piped gas. This means it now competes with Asia for (the) global LNG supply, and (is) therefore driving up prices as more LNG is being pulled into Europe,"" she said.
""As a result, Asian LNG demand has already fallen by 7 per cent year-on-year.""
Ms Asti noted that gas has become a major issue for governments ahead of the winter months.
""Energy security is (at) the top of governments' agendas as gas is a crucial fuel to meet heating and power demand,"" she said.

How will Singapore be affected?
According to EMA, Singapore currently relies on natural gas to generate 95 per cent of its electricity.
Traditionally, most of Singapore's natural gas supply has been piped in from Indonesia and Malaysia. However, LNG began to play a bigger role in power generation from 2013 when Singapore's LNG terminal began operations.
The cost of LNG can therefore affect the cost of electricity here.
""Naturally, energy pricing trickles down. As such, nations will have to contend with rising prices to support the cost of generation fuels,"" said Mr Copson.
However, electricity prices in Singapore should be somewhat protected from volatility in LNG prices because of the nature of the country's contracts for gas, said Mr Siow.
""Generally, Singapore gas demand is fulfilled through long-term contracts, whether it's pipe gas or LNG,"" he said.
""If we compare this to Europe, I would say Singapore electricity prices should be fairly insulated from the volatile spikes in spot LNG price.""
Different power producers might have different LNG or gas purchasing strategies, however, which might open them up to more spot exposure.
""Spot LNG exposure is very expensive at the moment,"" Mr Siow noted.
""Even if the power producer is not exposed to spot LNG, there is a general rise in contracted LNG (and) gas prices due to the overall rising commodity prices, For example, Brent oil has risen above US$100 (per barrel) this year,"" he added.
“This would translate to higher gas (and) LNG prices as well, as long-term contract prices (are) usually oil-linked. When gas prices (are) higher, Singapore's electricity price will go up as it is almost entirely generated by gas (and) LNG.""
Ms Asti shared the same view and highlighted other circumstances under which turning to the spot market may be required.
""The majority of (the) gas supply to Singapore is under long-term contract, either through pipeline imports or LNG. This should help shelter the Singapore market from high spot LNG prices,"" she said.
""However, there may be a need to purchase the higher-priced spot LNG if gas demand increases beyond contracted supply or if there are disruptions in pipeline supply from either Indonesia or Malaysia. We saw this happen previously in Q4 2021.""
Beyond electricity prices, the industrial sector will also be hit by rising LNG prices, as will any company that uses gas or LNG, Mr Siow said.
""Petchems as well, though its percentage in Singapore's gas sectoral consumption is pretty low,"" he added.
Affected companies may try to pass the additional costs to their end users, which will add to inflationary pressure, Ms Asti said.
She added that, going forward, Singapore will have to manage its exposure to prices as LNG demand increases. 
""Commodity price shocks have happened in the past, but Singapore's LNG demand ... only started in 2013 with its first LNG imports,"" she said.
""By 2030, we expect 90 per cent of Singapore's gas demand will be met by LNG, so it will need to manage that growing exposure to LNG prices.""

What alternatives to LNG does Singapore have?
One way for Singapore to make up for any shortfall in its LNG supply is to seek more piped gas from its neighbours, Ms Asti said.
""Apart from LNG, Singapore also imports gas via pipelines from Indonesia and Malaysia. It could seek to boost volumes from these suppliers, but it will require negotiations with the upstream operators and likely the governments too,"" she said.
Singapore's reliance on natural gas is something that has only emerged over the past two decades.
According to EMA, natural gas only accounted for 26 per cent of Singapore's electricity production in 2001, with oil being the preferred fuel at the time.
One option then is to turn back the clock.
""Dirtier and less costly fossil fuels such as coal, petcoke, fuel oil and crude"" could be options for Singapore should its LNG supply be affected by demand elsewhere, said Mr Copson.
""There are other sources of power generation and it's something the government shall have to make a decision on,"" he said.
Mr Siow also pointed out the possibility of returning to previous fuel sources while highlighting green alternatives.
""This is a big topic being discussed by all leaders, everywhere. The answer can lie in nuclear, renewables, (going) back to oil (or) coal, geothermal, hydrogen,"" he said.
""(It) can be anything, but I think diversification is important so that we don't get caught up in any single commodity (or) fuel.""
He expressed his doubt, however, that solar power could be generated at a scale to replace gas.
One other promising renewable is hydropower.
""Singapore has already started importing hydropower from Laos of up to 100 MW,"" said Ms Asti, who added that the country is also looking to import renewable power from neighbouring markets such as Indonesia and Australia in order to diversify its generation mix and meet its net-zero targets.
""Several memorandums of understanding have been signed involving companies and governments too to help facilitate and support these large power development plans.""

Is there any end in sight?
While Ukraine has been retaking territory in recent weeks, Putin's announcement of a military mobilisation would indicate that the conflict won't be resolved anytime soon.
And with the West remaining at odds with Russia over the war, LNG prices will remain elevated.
""I cannot see how prices can stabilise if Russia continues to weaponise gas against Europe. Europe is scrambling to find a total replacement for Russian pipe gas, but it's proving to be a daunting task,"" said Mr Siow.
""This winter will be okay because the total gas storage level in Europe had (reached) a decent level even before Russia started to severely constrain its export flow. But what about the coming summer? Where can Europe find alternative gas to fill up its gas storage?
""Spot LNG prices, in my opinion, will continue to be volatile in the foreseeable few years.""
Mr Copson said that the stabilisation of LNG prices would be ""wholly dependent upon market dynamics"", and that demand in North Asia would be a key factor in pricing.
""Should North Asia feel they are not sufficiently well stocked, they will continue to buy – a major deciding factor will be China's decision to return to the spot market and how aggressively they will compete,"" he said.
""Regardless, (the war is) going to drive prices up as all the major buyers and countries compete for energy security.""
Ms Asti also expects the current situation to be the status quo in the near future, although she highlighted some upcoming projects that may boost the global supply of LNG.
""The market will remain tight until mid-decade assuming Russian pipeline flows to Europe remain curtailed,"" she said.
""The market will rebalance and prices soften once new supplies start entering into the market. Qatar's North Field Expansion volumes will be a huge part of that wave of new supply, but equally important will be all the new projects on the US Gulf Coast.
""Globally, so far this year, 28 mmtpa (million metric tonnes per annum) of new LNG capacity has been sanctioned, with at least another 100 mmtpa expected to take FID (final investment decision) by the end of 2024."""
"Commonwealth double deaths: Man who killed his mother, grandmother to be detained indefinitely","Gabriel Lien Goh was acquitted of two charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the grounds of unsound mind.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/commonwealth-double-deaths-man-killed-mother-grandmother-detained-indefinitely-2959816,"SINGAPORE: A 25-year-old man will be detained indefinitely at the President's pleasure after killing his mother and grandmother in 2019 while he was of unsound mind.
Gabriel Lien Goh was acquitted on Friday (Sep 23) of two charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, on the grounds of unsound mind. 
The judge ordered that he be kept in safe custody in prison and for the case to be reported to the minister. According to Section 252 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the minister may then order him to be confined in a psychiatric institution, prison or another suitable place of safe custody during the President's pleasure.
Goh killed his mother, 56-year-old Lee Soh Mui, by stabbing her chest on the morning of Oct 27, 2019 at Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue. Soon after, he killed his 90-year-old grandmother, Madam See Keng Keng, by punching her head multiple times.
Goh had consumed two tabs of lysergide or LSD before attacking his mother and grandmother. He took the second tab as he felt ""curious"" and wanted to see more psychedelic colours, Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said.
As a result, he was under an acute hallucinogen intoxication, the court heard. He was in an acute psychotic state, experiencing distortions of shapes and time sense, with anxiety and panic symptoms.
He retained only the most fragmentary and sketchy recollections of what happened, the court heard. When he came to his senses, he felt acute dysphoria as he came to terms with his acts and their consequences, said the prosecutor.
DAY OF THE INCIDENT
The court heard that Goh was serving his National Service at the time of the incident in October 2019. He stayed in a flat in Commonwealth with his mother, grandmother and a domestic helper.
On Oct 27, 2019, Goh took a tab of LSD after lunch by placing it under his tongue for about half an hour. He experienced sensory changes and took a second tab about one-and-a-half hours later.
Sometime that evening, he left home and returned with a knife. The maid heard Goh's mother telling him that she wanted to talk to him in his room, and she later heard the woman shouting Goh's name.
The maid then saw Goh standing in front of his mother, who was on the floor. He had stabbed his mother in the chest and again in the head.
The maid fled with Goh's grandmother. A neighbour saw the maid outside and noticed Goh walking towards them. 
He opened his door to let Goh's grandmother and maid into his flat, but before they could enter, Goh punched his grandmother in the face.
She fell and hit the railing, and the neighbour told Goh to calm down, but Goh punched him and caused him to fall.
The maid took Goh's grandmother into the neighbour's flat. She was bleeding from her face and sat on a stool. Goh followed them and grabbed the maid's wrist.
She broke free and ran out of the unit, calling her friends and Goh's older brother to ask them to call the police.
Goh's grandmother asked for tissues as she was bleeding, but Goh refused and stared at the neighbour before punching him multiple times. The neighbour fell to the floor and curled up to protect himself.
Goh then punched his grandmother multiple times while she was seated on the stool. He left the flat after she was covered in blood.
The neighbour called the police. Before Goh was arrested that evening, he continued attacking other neighbours and members of the public before being pinned down by four people.
Goh's urine samples contained LSD. The court heard that Goh began consuming the drug in December 2018 and had done so three times before the incident. He would usually buy LSD tabs for S$30 to S$35 each.
Autopsies showed that his mother died of a fatal stab wound to her chest and Goh's grandmother died of head injuries. She was found with multiple fractures on her face.
A senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Health assessed Goh and found that he was under acute hallucinogen intoxication at the time of the incident, resulting in clinically significant problematic behaviour.
This includes paranoid ideation of harm and persecution, impaired judgment and reality distortion. He also experienced depersonalisation and derealisation.
He knew full well the effects of LSD as he had previously researched it, but wanted to take a second tab out of curiosity, said the prosecutor.
Goh had experienced paranoia after taking LSD a few months before the incident. The court heard that Goh was in an acute psychotic state characterised by waves of exultation, alternating with fear and terror after consuming the second LSD tablet.
He experienced distortions, including of shapes and time, and was acutely paranoid. He was possibly hallucinating when he scuffled with his neighbours and the members of the public he met downstairs.
Because of his state, he was deprived of the mental capacity to know and appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his acts, said the prosecutor.
The court heard that Goh had also previously experimented with cannabis and nitrazepam, and had alcohol dependence.
Goh listened to proceedings with his head down most of the time. He gave a nod to his family members who were in the public gallery when he was first brought in.
In early court hearings after Goh was first charged in 2019, he apologised to his relatives, saying what happened was an accident and that he ""never intended for those things to happen""."
Worth watching: Talking Point’s special on teenage vaping,"Talking Point delves into the world of vaping to find out why more and more teens are getting hooked on vaping, and how they are getting their hands on vapes. Host Munah Bagharib goes on a hunt for the source of illegal vape pens.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/why-teens-vape-singapore-talking-point-special-2954496,"“Tim” (not his real name) picked up his first vape when he was 14 years old. He was hooked on cigarettes. So hooked, that in an attempt to make him quit, his dad gave him a vape.  
But it led to another addiction. Tim couldn’t get enough of vaping. He was puffing at home, in school, and even in class during lesson time.
“Sometimes I would feel like I need to take a smoke break, but I can’t leave the classroom, so I will just take a puff and then blow it into my bag, or like blow it into my shirt, because the smoke kind of like dissipates. It doesn’t smell,” he admits to Mediacorp current affairs show Talking Point.
Tim is not the only teen hooked on vaping.
In 2021, more than 4,600 people in Singapore were caught for buying, using and or possession of vapes. That’s more than triple the number, from the year before. A third of these vapers caught were under the age of 18.
What exactly is a vape? Essentially, it’s an e-cigarette, filled with liquid that comes in a cocktail of flavours so enticing with names like Pumpkin Spice and Bandung – it’s little wonder kids are lured.
In Singapore, vapes are banned. You can’t buy, own, or smoke a vape. But yet teens are getting their hands on it.
In a two-part Talking Point special, host Munah Bagharib delves deep into the world of vaping. She investigates how our youths are getting access to something so contraband and what happens if one starts vaping at such a young age.
She meets Tim and other teens who vape and finds out just how accessible the contraband devices are.
“Kelly”, who started vaping at 16 years of age told her: “It’s easier to get a vape than for me to go out and buy cigarettes because I’m still underage.
""Like (at) 7-11, you have CCTV and stuff. So much easier to get like a vape.”
Karen Lim, a student health advisor at the Health Promotion Board whose work involves helping kids to quit smoking, says about half her caseload now involves students who vape.
Despite authorities weeding out and shutting down social media listings which sell vapes in Singapore, Talking Point managed to find many others, including thriving Telegram chatrooms, which are even hawking vapes containing juice laced with THC.
THC is the main psychoactive compound found in marijuana. So what exactly are our kids inhaling? Talking Point worked with Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority to get some confiscated vapes sent to a lab for testing and the results are shocking.
Among the chemicals found was formaldehyde, a cancer-causing agent used in the process of embalming. They also discovered nicotine levels surpassing a stick of cigarette. 
Dr Aneez DB Ahmed, senior consultant surgeon for thoracic surgery at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital says he is starting to see cases of teen vapers with inflamed lungs.
“The earlier you start, definitely the higher the risk of you getting cancer and lung injury,"" he adds.
“If you turn yourself into a closet vaper, you will probably be taking more nicotine. It definitely affects the younger people. It affects the development of the brain in a younger age group.” 
















In part 2 of the special, Talking Point host Munah heads across the Causeway to track down the source of some of the vapes getting into Singapore. She also delves deeper into how exactly vape companies are luring youths.The second part of the special airs 9.30pm, Thursday (Sep 29), on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

"International order imperfect, but by far the best bet for small states: PM Lee","Small states must participate actively to strengthen a multilateral system which they depend on for security and survival, says Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/international-order-imperfect-best-bet-small-states-lee-hsien-loong-2959621,"SINGAPORE: The global order is imperfect but still the best bet for small states looking to secure their place in the world, said Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Sep 23). 
Speaking in a recorded video message at a reception for the Forum of Small States during the ongoing United Nations (UN) General Assembly, he noted that small states depend on the multilateral, rules-based system for security and survival. 
“This international order is imperfect, but it is by far our best bet,” said Mr Lee. “If we regress to a world where ‘might is right’, small states would find it impossible to survive and even big countries will not be better off.”
The Forum of Small States is an informal grouping of more than 100 small countries that was launched by Singapore in 1992. Mr Lee last addressed the Forum publicly when he hosted a reception for members in 2019.
This year, the grouping is commemorating its 30th anniversary amid heightened geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, he said, noting that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine undermines the rules-based order, and that rising food and oil prices and supply chain disruptions continue to worsen poverty. 
“Small states face immense challenges. Our external environment has become more troubled and dangerous,” said Mr Lee.
Tensions between the United States and China raise the risk of conflict between major powers and climate change, novel pathogens and cyber threats endanger the safety, security and well-being of people around the world, he added.
“These uncertainties and threats can pose grave dangers to the economies, societies and very existence of small states like us. We are inherently vulnerable, with very little buffer against shocks.
“But small states are by no means without agency. What we lack in size, we can make up for through agility, resourcefulness, and cooperation,” said Mr Lee, pointing out that small states can be effective at the UN by supporting and upholding the multilateral rules-based system. 
They must participate actively to strengthen this system, said the Prime Minister, as he emphasised the need to “maintain as level a playing field as possible, to protect the interests of small states”.
They also need to work together on specific interests like sustainable development, climate change, cyber security and other emerging issues like the governance of oceans and outer space, he noted. 
“We can work on them through both existing and new international instruments. We should participate in shaping the international agenda,” said Mr Lee. 
“Right from the start, the concerns and interests of small states should be taken into account. Small states often lack the resources and capacity to engage effectively across the whole range of international issues.” 
Calling the Forum of Small States a “valuable platform for informal exchange and mutual support”, Mr Lee noted that many members are making significant contributions to the UN, with representation in important bodies such as the UN Security Council. 
“We need to support each other’s candidatures for UN elections,” he added. “It is vital that small states always have a voice in the key bodies making up the UN system.”"

The death sentence used to be mandatory until January 2013, when the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012) came into operation, said Ms A Meenakshi, an associate at IRB Law.
The amendment allowed the court to have the discretion to sentence a person to life imprisonment with caning instead of death for certain murder offences.
The first factor that determines whether an accused person receives the death penalty or life imprisonment is the selection of the charge against him or her, said Mr Johannes Hadi, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.
""The Penal Code sets out a hierarchical rubric for the categorisation of homicide offences,"" he explained. 
At the top of this hierarchy is Section 300(a) – murder with the intention to cause death. This is the most serious and carries the mandatory death penalty, said Mr Hadi.
""This means that if one is convicted of a Section 300(a) charge, the only possible sentence is death.""
There are three other types of murder offences: Section 300(b), (c) and (d). Section 300(b) is where the act is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury that the offender knows is likely to cause death. 
Section 300(c) is if the act is done with the intention to cause bodily injury to a person, and the injury intended is sufficient to cause death. Section 300(d) is where the person committing the act knows it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or an injury likely to cause death, and commits such an act without any excuse for incurring the risk of death. 
Anyone convicted of these three offences can be sentenced either to death or to life imprisonment and caning.

Man gets life imprisonment and caning for murdering fellow jogger in Punggol during 'circuit breaker'













Even for Section 300(a), there are two exceptions to the mandatory death penalty, said Ms Tania Chin, litigation partner at Withers KhattarWong.
These are: Where the offender was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder, or where the offender was pregnant at the time of sentencing.
The first case in Singapore where the Court of Appeal dealt with the issue of when a court can and should impose the death penalty for murder was the case of Kho Jabing, said IRB Law's Ms Meenakshi.
In that case, he was sentenced first to life imprisonment for murder. However, the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's decision and sentenced Kho to death. He has since been executed.
The Court of Appeal held that the death penalty is warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community, and where there is viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life, said Ms Meenakshi.
Several factors go towards deciding on blatant disregard, lawyers said. These include the mental state of the offender at the time of the attack, his role or participation in the attack, and his age and intelligence.
Who decides which murder charge an accused person receives?
The prosecution has the discretion to decide which charge to bring against an accused. 
""The prosecution could well prefer a charge with discretionary death sentence, even if the mandatory death penalty charge under Section 300(a) can be made out,"" said Ms Chin.
The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, she added.
""Due to the high degree of culpability required, and the high threshold of proving an intention to kill under Section 300(a), the prosecution may in certain situations choose to proceed with Section 300(b), (c) or (d) instead.""
Ms Chin gave an example of where a person stabs a victim twice in the thigh and the victim dies. In such a situation, the prosecution is more likely to allege an intention to cause bodily injury that is likely to cause death – under Section 300(b) – or the intention to cause bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death – Section 300(c). This is because it is easier to prove than an intention to kill, even if the victim did die as a result.
The prosecutor would primarily be guided by the evidence in a case when deciding whether to prefer a Section 300(a) charge against an accused person, said Mr Hadi of Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.
Other than considering whether the person intended specifically to cause the victim's death, another important consideration would be the assessment of the public interest demands of the case, he said.
Even if the prosecution selects a charge without the mandatory death penalty, it can still submit that the appropriate sentence should be death, said Mr Hadi. The court will ultimately make the decision.
Commenting on the case of the Punggol jogger murder, he said it appears that the offender's multiple mental disorders, intellectual limitations, lack of previous offending and relatively young age may have been relevant considerations.
Ms Meenakshi pointed to the case of Daryati, who murdered her employer. The former maid was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death.
In sentencing her, the High Court judge noted: ""The specific nature of the incident did not reflect a cold and calculated killing, but rather, intense panic and distress in executing her plan to return home. I therefore exercised my discretion to impose a term of life imprisonment.”

Teenager who killed Anthony Ler’s wife gets clemency; released from jail after 17 years 
























Is life imprisonment really for life?
A sentence of life imprisonment in Singapore means the offender will be imprisoned for the duration of his or her natural life, said Withers KhattarWong's Ms Chin.
However, the Prisons Act 1993 provides that after such an offender serves 20 years in jail, the Minister of Home Affairs must review the case. The minister may then direct the Commissioner to make a remission order. 
If a life sentence is remitted, various conditions will be imposed on the offender. The life sentence will be suspended, said Ms Meenakshi, and cancelled when the offender dies.
If the offender is found unsuitable for a remission order, the Prisons Act mandates that the minister must review the decision periodically, at least once a year, said Ms Chin.
However, in reality, there's no guarantee of release, said lawyer Josephus Tan. 
Asked if he knew of cases where an offender linked to a murder was released on remission, he pointed to the Anthony Ler case. A teenager who murdered Ler's wife on Ler's instructions was granted clemency in 2018, after serving 17 years in jail.
However, this was under the old legal regime, where the offender was detained at the President's pleasure. This has since been repealed and substituted with life imprisonment for offenders who committed murder below the age of 18 at the material time, said Mr Tan.
""For post-1997 cases, I've not personally seen a release after 20 years,"" said Mr Tan."
"Daily round-up, Sep 22: Singapore fresh fish prices to keep increasing; analysts say Putin preparing for long war in Ukraine; Taiwan eyeing end to COVID-19 quarantine",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-fish-prices-putin-ukraine-war-taiwan-travel-covid19-immunity-antibody-test-2957751,"Let's get you up to speed with the day's stories.
Singapore fresh fish prices up 20% this year; more increases expected until Chinese New Year
Average prices for fresh fish from Malaysia and Indonesia have risen by about 20 per cent so far this year. Industry players are expecting prices to continue increasing over the next few months, as the monsoon season shrinks supply, and the upcoming holiday period intensifies demand.
A dwindling catch from commercial fishing has made the situation worse, with fisheries citing climate change as a contributor to the unpredictable supply.
Costs were made even higher for Indonesian fishermen this month when fuel prices, already soaring since the Ukraine war, were hiked by about 30 per cent as the government reined in energy subsidies.
Some consumers have turned to cheaper options, such as frozen or farmed fish, a seafood shop owner told CNA. He added that some businesses absorb rising costs in the initial stages, but will transfer the costs to consumers once it is no longer sustainable.
Russia's mobilisation indicates Putin preparing for long war in Ukraine: Analysts
President Vladimir Putin's mobilisation of 300,000 military reservists an indication that he is preparing for a long, drawn-out war in Ukraine, said analysts.
One expert said the mobilisation, Russia's first since World War II, can be seen as an act of desperation that will prolong the war, but won’t change its outcome.
Others added that this signalled Putin's recognition that his invasion has not gone according to plan - and that despite dangling incentives to attract volunteer soldiers, Russia is facing a manpower crunch on the frontline.
Russia’s reservists are unlikely to be hardened forces as most have been out of the service for a long time, and Moscow would need to spend time and reserves training them, said one analyst. He said that this would likely give Ukraine a chance at making further headway in regaining more territory.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has demanded that the United Nations punish Russia for its invasion and strip it of its Security Council veto.
Taiwan eyes mid-October end to COVID-19 quarantine on road to reopening
Taiwan aims to end its mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for arrivals from around Oct 13 and will ease other restrictions from next week as it continues to reopen to the outside world.
Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng told reporters that from next Thursday (Sep 29) visa-free entry will be resumed for citizens of all countries that previously had that status. The government will also increase weekly arrival limits for international travellers by 10,000 to 60,000, with no more PCR tests for arrivals.
If ""everything is under control"", the government is aiming to end mandatory quarantine for all arrivals from around Oct 13, he said.
Singapore scientists develop blood test kit to detect immunity against COVID-19 in 10 minutes
A team of scientists in Singapore has developed a blood test kit that can tell in 10 minutes if a person has immunity against COVID-19, with up to 93 per cent accuracy. 
The kit was developed by a team from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU). 
It requires a drop of blood and can detect if a person has antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – in 10 minutes, compared with 24 to 72 hours needed for conventional laboratory testing.
Based on the antibodies detected in the test, it can tell a person how cautious they should be about potential infection before a booster, and when a booster should be taken. The test kit can also be adapted for new variants of concern and other diseases in the future, the scientists said.
Further development of the test kit is underway to meet necessary regulatory approvals and manufacturing standards for public use."
"Probation for man who sexually assaulted 2 girls in his youth group, stalked ex-girlfriend","The man was also part of the SG Nasi Lemak Telegram group, which circulated explicit photos and videos of women. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/21-months-probation-man-sexual-assault-teenage-girls-youth-group-harass-ex-girlfriend-explicit-photos-2957931,"SINGAPORE: A man sexually assaulted two teenage girls who were part of his youth group when he was 16 years old, taking advantage of one when she was ill and the other as she comforted him.
The man, now 22, had also harassed an ex-girlfriend, threatening to upload her explicit photographs and videos.
The Singaporean man was given 21 months of probation on Thursday (Sep 22) after previously pleading guilty to six charges relating to sexual penetration of a minor under 16, unlawful stalking and threatening to distribute intimate images or recordings. Another eight charges were considered for his sentencing.
In addition, he will have to perform 60 hours of community service and attend psychological treatment among other conditions.
None of the parties in this case can be named due to a court-imposed gag order.





TOOK ADVANTAGE OF GIRL WHO WAS COMFORTING HIM
One of the girls he sexually assaulted was 13 years old then. The man knew that she had a crush on him. However, the pair never dated.
He asked this girl home in 2016, claiming that he needed someone to confide his personal problems in. While in his bedroom, the man began to cry and hugged the victim.
The victim reluctantly hugged him back, believing that she was consoling him. However, the man abruptly kissed her lips before sexually assaulting her.
“The accused then told (the victim) that he knew (the victim) wanted to have sex with her. (The victim) told the accused that he was mistaken, because she had not even kissed anyone before the accused had suddenly kissed her without her consent,” court documents read.
Ignoring the girl’s protests, the man pinned her down and sexually assaulted her.
After the incident, the man ignored the girl and treated her coldly. It dawned on the girl that the man was not interested in a relationship and was only using her to satisfy his lust.
The man also sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl whom he dated for two months. They began dating in June 2016 but the girl broke up with him after discovering that he had been cheating on her.
The pair agreed to meet for breakfast one morning in June 2016. However, the girl came down with a fever. Instead of cancelling the date, the man got the victim to rest at his home before they went out.
The girl rested on his bed intending to take a nap, but the man sexually assaulted her. The girl was unable to fend him off in her weak state, court documents stated.
The offences came to light in 2018 when the man shared with his mentor at the youth group that he had had sex with three girls in 2016.
The mentor lodged a police report on May 21, 2018.

The man also harassed an ex-girlfriend and her family.
The two began dating in February 2018 but the girl, whose age was undisclosed, soon came to realise that the man kept texting other girls. She initiated a breakup but the man would threaten to kill himself. When those threats lost effect, the man would turn up at the girl’s workplace uninvited.
Even when the girl left for an overseas internship in 2019, the man would harass her colleagues and family members when she did not respond to his messages.
“The aim of these messages was to force (the victim) into texting the accused, by disrupting her work at the internship until she acceded to his demands,"" said court documents. 
""In his messages to her colleagues and family members, the accused threatened to repeatedly call (the victim’s) office and make sure that she would not be able to do her work, or even falsely informed her colleagues that (the victim) was either skipping work or even resigning.
“The accused also cast aspersions on (the victim’s) character by sending profanity-laden messages ... To cause further alarm, the accused also threatened to make a police report on the false allegation that (the victim) was being harassed by her male boss.”
In 2020, the girl broke up with the man but lodged a police report after the man threatened to expose her compromising photos and videos online. The man had refused to delete them after the relationship ended.
The victim felt alarmed as she had found out that the man was a member of the SG Nasi Lemak Telegram group that shared obscene media of women.
She lodged several police reports against the man over the harassment."
Man who paid S$500 to have someone else take basic theory test on his behalf gets jail,"Goh Ah Hock was caught after the tester noticed that the imposter did not look like Goh in his work permit photo. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-paid-s500-agent-imposter-take-basic-theory-test-jail-2957441,"SINGAPORE: Worried that he would fail his basic theory test for a driving licence, a Malaysian man hired someone else to do it for him.
Goh Ah Hock’s ruse came to light when the tester asked the imposter to remove his mask and noticed that the imposter’s face looked different from the photo on Goh’s work permit.
Goh, 52, was jailed for two months on Thursday (Sep 22), after pleading guilty to abetting the offence of cheating by personation with Zhang Zhongliang, who had been hired to take the basic theory test.
The incident took place at the Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) at 2 Woodlands Industrial Park E4 in June.
Zhang was jailed for two months on Jul 21 for the offence of attempted cheating.





The court heard that Goh formed the impression that the use of foreign vehicles in Singapore would be banned in July.
At the time, Goh, who worked at a construction company, was using his Malaysia-registered motorcycle. As he was going to work here for the long term, he decided to buy a Singapore motorcycle and convert his Malaysian licence to a Singapore licence. 
To do so, Goh needed to take the basic theory test, but he was not confident of passing it.
Instead, Goh decided to engage an unidentified agent through his colleague to facilitate the conversion of the driving licence. In return, he would pay S$500.
On Jun 28 this year, Goh met and paid the agent S$500 outside SSDC. Goh was informed someone would take the test on his behalf and was asked to hand over his work permit. He then left to wait at a coffeeshop.
Meanwhile, Zhang, a 28-year-old Chinese national, had been hired after he responded to a WeChat advertisement to take the test on behalf of another person for S$200.
He met the agent outside SSDC, and was instructed to take the test on Goh’s behalf. Upon completion, Zhang was supposed to meet the agent outside SSDC to receive his payment.
At around 9am on Jun 28, Zhang entered the holding room to wait for his turn for the test. The tester called out Goh’s name and Zhang replied, before presenting Goh’s work permit as his own.
The tester then asked Zhang to take off his mask and noticed that he looked different from the photo on the permit. Zhang was also unable to state Goh’s FIN number upon request.
Suspicious, the tester requested other documents for identification. Zhang then left the room and returned with Goh. The police were later called in. 
""Had Zhang been successful in the deception, (the tester) allowing Zhang to take the (basic theory test) on Goh's behalf would have been likely to cause harm to the reputation of (the tester),"" said the prosecution. 
Goh’s lawyer Lim Kim Song argued for one month’s jail for his client, submitting that his culpability was lower than Zhang’s.
According to the lawyer, Zhang was playing the active role while Goh was “passive”.
For cheating by personation, Zhang could have been jailed for up to five years, or fined, or both."
Life imprisonment for man who stabbed roommate after fight over spending habits,"After stabbing his roommate, Naing Lin left the flat without checking on the victim and only returned the next morning. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stabbed-roommate-after-argument-over-spending-habit-life-imprisonment-2956791,"SINGAPORE: After an argument over his roommate’s spending habits, a man went to prepare some food but ended up stabbing his roommate with the knife he meant to cut ingredients with.
Naing Lin, a 51-year-old Myanmar national, was intoxicated when he swung his knife at compatriot Myo Kyaw Thu, stabbing him several times in his chest and abdomen in their flat at Bedok Reservoir Road on Apr 2, 2021.
He left the flat and did not return until the next morning when he saw the victim lying motionless in the bedroom in a pool of blood.
Naing Lin was sentenced to life imprisonment on Thursday (Sep 22) after pleading guilty to one count of murder.
The court heard that the victim, 49, was a senior technician in Singapore but had been on a short-term visit pass at the time of his death.
In the afternoon before the incident, both men had a drinking session with friends. Naing Lin had five to seven large cans of beer.
The pair returned separately to the room they shared at Bedok Reservoir Road. 
ARGUMENT OVER SPENDING HABITS
As Naing Lin entered the bedroom, he saw Myo Kyaw Thu sitting on his bed using his phone. They began quarrelling over the victim's spending habits. 
""The accused told the deceased that it was shameful that the deceased borrowed money from others, including the accused himself, despite being an engineer,"" said the prosecution. 
Myo Kyaw Thu retorted that he would settle his own issues without asking Naing Lin for money. 
At this point, according to the prosecution, Naing Lin left for the kitchen, wanting to fry an egg with onions. He picked up a kitchen knife and was preparing to cook when he realised he did not have his phone with him.
He returned to his bedroom to get his phone with the knife still in his hand. 
When the victim asked why he was holding the knife and scolded vulgarity at him, Naing Lin swung the knife at him, slashing his face.
He continued stabbing his roommate in his chest, abdomen and upper left arm, causing the victim to collapse.
Naing Lin then changed his clothes, took his mobile phone and wallet and left the unit at about 6.20pm, without checking on his roommate.
Over the next few hours, Naing Lin contacted several friends and asked them to get in touch with the victim. Naing Lin also tried to call and text Myo Kyaw Thu. 
Accompanied by a friend, Naing Lin finally made his way back to the unit at around 9.20am the next day. He initially remained in the lorry he was driving while the friend tried to enter the flat and called out to the victim.
Both men later saw the victim lying in a pool of blood through the bedroom window. Naing Lin surrendered to the police. 
The victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was found to have died from ""haemorrhage due to stab wounds of chest and abdomen"", according to an autopsy report. 
An assessment by the Institute of Mental Health found that Naing Lin was intoxicated at the time of the crime but had no major mental disorder, was not intellectually disabled and was not of unsound mind. His intoxication was not to the extent that he would not have known what he was doing was wrong. 
The prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutors Teo Lu Jia and Seah Ee Wei, did not object to life imprisonment based on the circumstances of the case. ""The accused did not exhibit viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life in the commission of the offence,"" the prosecution added. 
Describing Naing Lin’s remorse, his lawyers Sanjiv Rajan and Minn Naing Oo cited a portion of their client’s statement to the police where he said: “I should have called for the ambulance, then my friend would not have died.
""In my moment of drunk state and confusion, I left the house and drove away. I am very sad about what happened. I did not plan or expect this. He is a close friend and drinking buddy. Although we have disagreements I mean no harm to him. This was accidental.”
His lawyers pointed out that he had voluntarily surrendered and substantially cooperated with the authorities. 
Noting that Naing Lin would be missing the formative years of his son in Myanmar, Mr Sanjiv said: “Hopefully we can move on a trajectory that gives my client some hope or some prospect … of being reunited with his family one day.”
For murder, Naing Lin could have been sentenced to death, but Justice Valerie Thean said that the facts of the case did not merit the death penalty."
Singapore scientists develop blood test kit to detect immunity against COVID-19 in 10 minutes,"The serology test, which is up to 93 per cent accurate, paves the way for personalised vaccination strategies where people are vaccinated or given booster shots when necessary, said the scientists.

The test kit can be “easily adapted” for new variants of concern and other diseases in the future, the scientists said, describing the test as “low cost”.
The test can be administered by a person without medical training and does not require any specialised laboratory equipment. This will pave the way for ""large-scale testing of vulnerable subsets of the population"", such as the elderly, said the news release.

The test kit detects COVID-19 immunity based on the antibodies detected in the blood sample, the scientists said. This is different from antigen rapid test kits, which look for the presence of viral proteins produced during COVID-19 infection. 
Based on the antibodies detected in the test, this can inform a person about how cautious they should be about potential infection before a booster, and when a booster should be taken.
“It paves the way for personalised vaccination strategies, where people are only given vaccinations and booster shots when necessary, depending on their variance in antibody levels and immune response,” the researchers said.
As of Tuesday, 93 per cent of Singapore's population has completed the full vaccination regimen. About 80 per cent of the total population has received a booster shot.
Further development of the test kit is underway to meet necessary regulatory approvals and manufacturing standards for public use, said SMART and NTU.
The team at SMART that worked on the test kit has set up a start-up named Thrixen, which is developing the test into a commercially ready product.

Malaysia Chiak! food court at Northpoint City suspended for 2 weeks due to cockroach infestations,"The licensee of Malaysia Chiak! was also fined S$800.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/malaysia-chiak-food-court-northpoint-city-shopping-mall-yishun-suspended-infestation-2956716,"SINGAPORE: The licence of Malaysia Chiak! food court at Northpoint City has been suspended for two weeks from Wednesday (Sep 21) due to cockroach infestations, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said.
The licensee has also been fined S$800 after accumulating 12 demerit points in a year. It was given six demerit points each for two offences of failing to keep the premises free of infestation.
The first offence was committed on Mar 23, SFA said on Friday in response to CNA's queries. The operator engaged pest control services to conduct additional ad hoc pest control treatments following each offence.
There has not been any food-borne illness that has been linked to the lapses, SFA said.
A licensee who accumulates 12 or more demerit points within a year may have its licence suspended for a period of either two or four weeks, or the licence may be cancelled.
The suspension of the food court's licence will run from Wednesday to Oct 4.
In response to CNA's queries, a spokesperson for Malaysia Chiak! apologised for the inconvenience to customers.
The spokesperson said it received notification of the suspension on Sep 1 and put in place plans during the temporary closure to refurbish the food court's layout so as to ""better facilitate outlet cleaning and upkeep"".
""To prevent similar occurrences of such incidents, we will be sending all our food handlers for retraining on food safety and hygiene,"" the spokesperson added.
""Since April, we have also doubled the number of inspections with our pest control vendor and will be actively working with them to implement an effective solution.""
A spokesperson for Northpoint City said that it is aware that the food court's business operations have been temporarily suspended.
""The health and safety of our staff, tenants and shoppers is important to us, and we have reminded all our F&B tenants to maintain strict levels of hygiene at all times,"" added the spokesperson. 
CNA has contacted SFA for more information.
All food handlers working in the suspended premises will be required to re-attend and pass the Food Safety Course Level 1 before they can resume work, said SFA.
The licensee is also required to ensure that all food hygiene officers working in the suspended premises, if any, re-attend and pass the Food Safety Course Level 3, added the agency.
""SFA takes a serious view of these offences and would like to remind food operators to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times, and to engage only registered food handlers,"" it said.
""SFA will not hesitate to take firm action against anyone found to be in violation of the Environmental Public Health Act.""
The agency also advised members of the public who come across poor hygiene practices in food establishments not to patronise such outlets and provide feedback to SFA.

New council formed to revamp Singapore's outdoor adventure education sector,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/council-outdoor-adventure-education-safety-infrastructure-2955191,"SINGAPORE: A council has been formed to spearhead the development of Singapore's outdoor adventure education sector by setting national standards for operations and safety, among other tasks. 
Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong made the announcement on Thursday (Sep 22) at the inaugural Outdoor Education Conference held at Republic Polytechnic. 
The 18-member Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) Council is part of efforts to support the growing demand for outdoor activities. 
An estimated 218,000 students per year take part in OAE programmes run by the Education Ministry and Outward Bound Singapore and private operators, the National Youth Council (NYC) said in a press release. 
There are about 40 commercial OAE providers who run programmes for schools and also cater to thousands of others who take part in adventure activities like hiking, rock climbing, kayaking and ropes courses.
GUIDELINES FOR ""TRANSPARENT, CONSISTENT, SAFE"" PRACTICES
The council will oversee the development of national standards and technical references for Singapore's OAE sector, NYC said. 
""These will guide specifications for the design and conduct of OAE activities, including the installation, operation, and maintenance of OAE facilities, infrastructure, and equipment,"" it added. 
The council will also work towards recommending core competencies and professional certifications required for local instructors. This is so that ""the public can be assured of transparent, consistent, and safe OAE practices across the sector"". 
""Experiencing the outdoors spurs our youth to grow well, equipping them with skills to meet challenges, enjoy teamwork and to embark on life with confidence,"" co-chair of the council, Adjunct Associate Professor Tan Lai Yong said. 
He added that the council ""seeks to make outdoor learning relevant, to engage stakeholders as we think safety alongside robust activities, and to craft purposeful careers for instructors and ‘outdoor’ entrepreneurs"". 
The council includes representatives from the Ministry of Education, Outward Bound Singapore, Outdoor Learning and Adventure Education Association, Republic Polytechnic, Sport Singapore and technical experts.
Last year, a 15-year-old student from ACS (Independent) died from multi-organ failure while participating in a high-element rope course at SAFRA Adventure Sports Centre in Yishun.
A man has been charged in relation to the teenager's death. According to his charge, he committed a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide by illegally omitting to ensure that both of the leg straps of the student's safety harness were properly buckled and adjusted before dispatching the teenager onto the rope course.

Singapore fresh fish prices up 20% this year; more increases expected until Chinese New Year,"Industry players are expecting prices to continue increasing over the next few months, as the monsoon season dwindles supply, and the upcoming holiday period intensifies demand.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fish-prices-increase-inflation-monsoon-malaysia-chinese-new-year-2954296,"SINGAPORE: Fishmonger Mr Lee Yit Huat used to clear his daily fish stock ahead of closing time. But these days, with rising prices putting off some customers, he often still has about 10 per cent of his daily offerings left on the counter at 7pm, when his stall at Tekka Market winds down.
Spanish mackerel, known locally as batang, used to cost between S$15 and S$20 per kilogramme at Mr Lee’s stall two months ago. Today, the price of this popular fish commonly used in soup and porridge has risen by S$5 to between S$20 and S$25.
As a result, Mr Lee is seeing a 5 per cent to 10 per cent decrease in customer numbers, as well as smaller portions purchased.
“No choice, now the economy also not very good. So everyone will buy less, buy a bit, don't buy a lot,” said Mr Lee. “Sometimes I tell them the price, (and they reply) ‘So expensive, I don't eat today,’ or ‘I eat some other small fish, cheaper’,” said Mr Lee.
Average prices for fresh fish from Malaysia and Indonesia have risen by about 20 per cent so far this year. Industry players are expecting prices to continue increasing over the next few months, as the monsoon season shrinks supply, and the upcoming holiday period intensifies demand.
















CLIMATE, FUEL, INFLATION PUSH UP COSTS
""Fishermen today tend to get less fish,” said Mr Eric Lee, owner of Lee Chuan Seng Fishery. “There's less fish in the sea nowadays; (it's) getting less and less, you can see it's quite obvious.”
A dwindling catch from commercial fishing has made the situation worse, with fisheries citing climate change as a contributor to the unpredictable  supply.
“Nowadays it’s difficult to predict the harvest. Maybe due to global warming. It used to be certain month you get certain fish, but nowadays we can’t predict,” said Mr Daniel Pe, chairman of the Punggol Fish Merchants Association.
Costs were made even higher for Indonesian fishermen this month when fuel prices, already soaring since the Ukraine war, were hiked by about 30 per cent as the government reined in energy subsidies.
“If the monsoon is too strong, (the fishermen) don’t go out so they don’t waste the diesel. When the monsoon comes, we cannot get fish,” said Mr Lee, who added that this contributes to rising expenses as merchants still have to cover utilities and manpower costs, but have lesser fish to sell.
Some consumers have turned to cheaper options, such as frozen or farmed fish. Inflation is more obvious in more expensive fish as the price difference seems substantial, said Alfred Goh, owner of Guang's Fresh Mart.
“Over a long period of time you realise there's been a significant increase in prices. This is probably worse off for hot ticket items like snapper, mackerel, cod and salmon. Those have seen much greater, more significant increase in prices as compared to cheaper fishes like kembong, kuning, and seabass,” said Mr Goh.
At Mr Goh’s shop, salmon now sells for between S$30 and S$40 per kilogramme, about S$10 more expensive than before, while cod costs almost S$50 per kilogramme, compared to close to S$40 in the past.
“So you do see consumers shifting towards cheaper varieties of fish. Because I think during these days where it's global inflation, everyone's feeling the pinch,” said Mr Goh.
FISHMONGERS, TOO, FEEL THE PINCH
Fishmongers at Geylang Serai Market told CNA that they have been placing fewer orders for more expensive varieties such as red snapper, which can cost around S$12 per kilogramme. Instead, they have been placing more orders for cheaper options like the Indian mackerel, which costs around S$7 per kilogramme.
“Fish supply has been really unstable as of late, prices fluctuate from day to day,” said Mr Goh. “For items that are more expensive, everyone just orders less of it. If you go around the markets, all the fishmongers are ordering in larger quantities cheaper items.”
Mr Goh said that some businesses absorb rising costs in the initial stages, but transfer the costs to consumers once it is no longer sustainable.
“We've been absorbing the increasing costs in terms of delivery, right along the supply chain, and to a point where it’s no longer affordable. And then we have to revise our prices up to take into account all of these rising (expenses),” said Mr Goh.
With some suppliers asking merchants for a 15 per cent to 20 per cent rise in prices to even out fuel costs, some in the industry are adapting by diversifying their sources for fish and looking to suppliers from other countries such as Thailand, India, and Myanmar, said Mr Pe.
PRICES ON UPTREND UNTIL CHINESE NEW YEAR
As the monsoon season approaches, fish prices are expected to climb even higher, up to after the holiday period in late January, industry players said.
“If the rainy season persists, and I mean, you know we're experiencing global warming, weather's really unstable. So if it does persist, then we do expect prices to go up, I think potentially by another 10 to 15 per cent probably over the next two months,” said Mr Goh.
The price of white snapper is forecast to increase about 10 per cent over the monsoon period, with mackerel likely to see a higher jump of about 30 per cent, said Mr Lee.
“Once the monsoon season is over, it’s the holiday season. So since demand during the year-end is likely to be better, prices probably won't go down,” said Mr Goh.
“Once the New Year is over, I think maybe once Chinese New Year is over in late January, then you generally start to see prices dipping.”

"Singapore shares reverse losses, bucking falls in Asia after US Fed delivers another big rate hike","Most Asian bourses traded in the red after the Fed announcement, as two other central banks in Asia followed through with rate hikes.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-shares-asia-markets-us-federal-reserve-rate-hike-2956546,"SINGAPORE: Singapore shares reversed earlier losses to end little changed on Thursday (Sep 22), bucking the sea of red in the region and overnight on Wall Street after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates and signalled further hikes ahead.
The Straits Times Index (STI) finished at 3,263.07, up 0.04 per cent or 1.28 points, after having fallen as much as 0.39 per cent in early morning trade. Losers outnumbered gainers 257 to 230, as 1.02 billion securities worth S$1.09 billion changed hands.
“The tilt towards risk-off has dominated early market performance,” said OCBC’s chief economist and head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling.
Banking stocks were among the day's heavily traded stocks in terms of value.
All three counters trimmed their losses towards the end of the trading session with DBS finishing little changed at S$33.52. OCBC shed 0.32 per cent, or S$0.04, to S$12.31, while UOB dropped 0.54 per cent, or S$0.15, to S$27.53.
Real estate investment trusts (REITS), which are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations given the impact on yield spreads and borrowing costs, were mixed.
Mapletree Logistics Trust and Suntec REIT declined about 0.6 per cent each, while Ascendas REIT advanced 0.36 per cent.
Inflight caterer and ground handler SATS tumbled 5.13 per cent, or S$0.21, to S$3.88. The company had on Wednesday said it was in discussions to acquire air cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services, although no definitive terms or formal legal documentation have been agreed upon.
In the region, most stock bourses traded in the red, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan at its lowest since May 2020.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.58 per cent after the Bank of Japan said on Thursday it would maintain its ultra-low interest rate and dovish policy guidance.
South Korea's Kospi index finished down 0.63 per cent, or 14.9 points, lower at 2,332.31, after falling as much as 1.62 per cent in early trade. The index marked the lowest close since Jul 15.
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index dived 1.61 per cent, or 296.67 points, to 18,147.95. Earlier in the day, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised its base rate charged through the overnight discount window by 75 basis points. Hong Kong’s monetary policy moves in lock-step with the United States as the city’s currency is pegged to the greenback.
Two other central banks in Asia followed through with rate hikes on Thursday – the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas announced a well-anticipated hike in its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point and Bank Indonesia raised its seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points.
The Philippine stock market was last seen trading 0.63 per cent lower on Thursday afternoon, while Indonesia’s benchmark Jakarta Composite Index edged up 0.43 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Fed’s announcement also sent the US dollar up to a fresh two-decade high, hitting new records against currencies such as the euro, pound and the yen.
The Singapore dollar lost as much as 0.23 per cent against the greenback to hit 1.4203 - its lowest since April 2020 - earlier in the trading day. It has since clawed back to 1.4174 per US dollar by late afternoon.
A strong dollar is likely to persist as the Fed continues with its aggressive rate hikes, but monetary policy tightening efforts among most Asian central banks should help to limit the extent of depreciation among regional currencies, said Mr Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan Asset Management.

A MORE HAWKISH FED
The US central bank announced its third consecutive interest rate increase of 0.75 percentage point on Wednesday, continuing forceful action to tamp down inflation that has surged to the highest in 40 years.
US stocks seesawed following the announcement and later finished the session in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.7 per cent at 30,183.78 on Wednesday. The S&P 500 slid 1.71 per cent to 3,789.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dove 1.79 per cent to 11,220.19.
Markets had been expecting another big interest rate increase, but were caught off guard by the Fed's outlook as far as the need for additional hikes.
The latest Fed statement included interest rate projections for the end of 2023 and 2024 that are higher than the previous forecasts, signalling that the US central bank now sees the need for a more prolonged monetary tightening cycle in light of inflation trends.
A ""more hawkish narrative” by Fed officials underscores the central bank’s “willingness to sacrifice growth to get inflation lower”, said analysts from ING Economics while pointing to how officials have cut their forecasts for several economic indicators.
“The Fed is effectively acknowledging that a recession is coming, but inflation will not fall quickly and there will be a lot of pain,” they said in a note.
Globally, the outlook has also dimmed.
Sustained interest rate hikes, coupled with existing pressures such as Europe’s energy crisis and heightened geopolitical tensions, might put the global economy at risk of a recession within the next year, said TD Ameritrade Singapore’s chief executive Greg Baker.
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INVESTORS OR HOME OWNERS
Mr Tai said the near-term outlook for equities will remain challenging amid the more hawkish path for interest rates. On the other hand, high-quality bonds with an intermediate to long duration may be more attractive within the fixed income space.
“The rate hike … (supports) our emphasis on portfolio stability and a more defensive stance on asset allocation. For Asia, the Fed’s outcome is also likely to keep pressure on risk assets in the near term, especially for export-oriented companies,” he said.
With major indices around the world reacting more sensitively to global macroeconomic indicators, Mr Baker said investors should keep their sights on the long term and maintain a diversified portfolio that can weather short-term market volatility.
In Singapore, short-term Singapore-dollar interest rates are likely to see further upward adjustments in order to keep pace with the hawkish US central bank, said OCBC’s Ms Ling.
“There could be more pressure emerging on property mortgage rates and refinancing costs for corporates going out into year-end and into early 2023,” she added.

CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?



















Beyond Singapore Savings Bonds and fixed deposits, what other low-risk investments are there?"
"Beyond Singapore Savings Bonds and fixed deposits, what other low-risk investments are there?","Beyond fixed deposits and Singapore Savings Bonds, experts say investors can also consider Treasury bills and short-term government securities bonds as low-risk investment options.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/treasury-t-bills-government-securities-bonds-sgs-investments-low-risk-2948356,"SINGAPORE: Rising interest rates on fixed deposits have attracted those in search of safe returns, with some customers enduring hours-long waits to secure promotional rates put out by several banks.
While squirrelling away money in fixed deposits appears to be an attractive option, there are other low-risk alternatives that investors can consider.
These include the Singapore Savings Bonds, which have seen hot demand in recent months. Short-term Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bonds have also been tossed up by some experts as an alternative to holding cash.
Before deciding where to park your money, consider and compare investments that offer similar risks, said Providend’s senior client adviser Tan Chin Yu.
“The higher rates (for fixed deposits) are definitely attractive, but they should be compared with other similar instruments such as Singapore Savings Bonds, Treasury bills or even short-term SGS bonds,” he said.
WHAT ARE T-BILLS AND SGS BONDS?
Like the Singapore Savings Bonds, Treasury bills (or T-bills) and SGS bonds are debt securities issued and backed by the Singapore Government.
These domestic debt securities are issued for various purposes. For example, the Singapore Savings Bonds provide retail investors with a flexible and risk-free investment option.
T-bills, which have maturities of one year or less, and SGS bonds, with longer durations ranging from two to 50 years, are issued to develop the debt market.
All three have seen rising yields, like all other major economies’ bond yields, as global central banks go on a rate-hike race to curb inflation. Among them, T-bills offer the highest rate of return for now.
The latest six-month T-bill gave a yield of 3.32 per cent – the highest this year and up from 0.48 per cent in January. Likewise, T-bills with a one-year maturity have seen rising returns from 0.75 per cent to 3.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, the most recent issuance of two-year SGS bonds offered a coupon rate of 2.7 per cent, while the five-year equivalent issued earlier this month had a return of 2.92 per cent.
The Singapore Savings Bonds, whose rates have been dipping since hitting a record high of 3 per cent in its August tranche, have a 10-year average return of 2.75 per cent for October.

THE PROS AND CONS
With their comparatively higher yields, T-bills and short-term SGS bonds are worth considering for investors looking to generate returns amid volatile market conditions, financial advisers told CNA.
Fully backed by the Government, they are also generally considered safe investments.
It is also likely that investors will get the amounts they apply for, unlike the Singapore Savings Bonds which have seen smaller allotment sizes amid red-hot demand, said PhillipCapital’s associate financial services manager Elijah Lee.
The Singapore Savings Bonds have a limit of S$200,000 per investor across different tranches, but for the August issue, the quantity ceiling – applied when applications exceed the issuance size – was S$9,000. 
Investors can put in up to S$1 million for each T-bill application and S$2 million for each SGS bond application. Retail investors typically get the amount they apply for, said Mr Lee.
In addition, there are no penalties for liquidating a T-bill or SGS bond before maturity, said Mr Tan, although he cautioned that doing so via a sale in the secondary market might carry the risk of capital losses.
T-bills and SGS bonds are tradable debt securities, meaning they can be bought or sold on the secondary market before maturity, although their prices are highly sensitive to interest rate movements. In general, bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions so if interest rates rise, bond prices will fall and vice versa.
Apart from market risk, liquidity could be an issue if there are few interested buyers.
“The bond market is not like the stock market … so it can be very hard to find a taker,” said Mr Lee. “You may have to offer a drastic, fire-sale kind of price … but it is unlikely that you are willing to lose that much so you will probably just hold on to it.”
He added: “Six months (for a T-bill) may seem like a short time, but it can feel like an eternity if you’re caught in a sticky situation.”
And upon maturity, Mr Lee, who specialises in retirement strategies, said investors will have to start shopping around for investment options and face the possibility of interest rate risk.
Using the example of a six-month T-bill, he said: “The rates have been very attractive but after six months, what’s next? 
“You will have to contend with the fact that every time you renew, you are hoping that the rates are still good.”




Listen:














TO INVEST OR NOT
For those deciding whether to invest in T-bills or short-term SGS bonds, experts recommend looking beyond the yield or return rate.
“An investor should always consider their time horizon which in general (means) the shorter the time horizon, the lesser risk one should take,” said Mr Tan. For instance in this case, one could opt for T-bills or short-tenor fixed deposits, instead of SGS bonds with maturity dates of two years and longer.
“Additionally, one should also consider the liquidity of the instruments, meaning how quickly they can access their capital if needed and if there are any risks in doing so,” he added.
“The best is to plan out properly the timeline when the money is required, then buy accordingly to your time frame.”





      Things to note if you’re investing in T-bills and SGS bonds
  

A minimum of S$1,000 is required to invest in both SGS bonds and T-bills, with investment amounts in multiples of S$1,000.
The difference lies in how the returns are paid out – while the SGS bonds pay a fixed rate of interest twice a year, T-bills are issued at a discount and investors receive the full face value at maturity.
Both securities are issued via auctions where competitive and non-competitive bids are placed. As the name suggests, a competitive bid allows applicants to specify the yield they are willing to accept, while a non-competitive bid is one where investors only specify the amount they want to invest but not the yield.
For retail investors, especially those exploring T-bills and SGS bonds for the first time, a non-competitive bid will be their best bet, according to experts.
“Retail investors will have little influence on the price and have to accept the market price. Big institutions that are the majority of buyers will be the price setters,” said Mr Tan from Providend.
When it comes to deciding whether to tap on cash or funds in one’s Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) or Central Provident Fund (CPF), Mr Lee recommends the first two given how they are “low-hanging fruits”.
“I will say use spare cash that you have and SRS funds first because they are yielding close to nothing.”
Mr Tan has a different opinion on SRS funds as they can only be withdrawn without penalty when one hits the statutory retirement age. Given the longer time horizon before these funds can be used, they can be better deployed into instruments such as equities, to better hedge against inflation.
Meanwhile, with funds in one's CPF Ordinary Account currently earning an interest rate of 2.5 per cent, experts said that T-bills may be a possible alternative to earn even higher returns, although investors will have to pop by a bank branch to make an application.
Online applications for T-bills are currently only available for cash and SRS funds, said Mr Lee.
 


 Collapse 
Expand






Asked for his preference, Mr Lee said investors in search of risk-free investments should consider the Singapore Savings Bonds as their first choice, given the instrument’s “very good balance” of liquidity and decent returns.
Investors are free to withdraw or redeem the savings bond at any time even though the product is issued with a 10-year maturity term. There are no penalties involved and accrued interest will not be forfeited.
The interest rate for the next tranche of Singapore Savings Bonds could also be headed higher, given how average SGS yields have inched back up this month after the decline in August, Mr Lee said. The interest rates of each Singapore Savings Bond issuance are based on the average SGS yields in the month before applications open.
However, T-bills can still be a good option for those with funds that they would like to set aside for near-term expenses, such as downpayment for a house, and do not want to take big risks, experts said.
But ultimately, with returns from lower-risk options unlikely to keep pace with inflation, investors may need to take a longer-term view by, for example, having a part of their portfolio in risky assets, such as equities.
“People have different goals. Some goals are more immediate and some are for the long term. So if yours is a long-term goal, you should find the right long-term asset class to invest in, and vice versa,” said Mr Lee.
“I know it may sound like general advice but you really need to consider all your assets and ask yourself what the money is for.”
Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story said that T-bills and SGS bonds can be bought or sold on the Singapore Exchange. Only SGS bonds can be traded on the Singapore Exchange. We apologise for the error."
"Moderna’s bivalent COVID-19 vaccine also creates antibodies against BA.4, BA.5 variants, says its chief medical officer","Singapore will receive the Moderna 1273.214 booster, which primarily targets the original strain and the BA.1 Omicron variant.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moderna-bivalent-covid-19-booster-vaccine-antibodies-ba4-ba5-omicron-2954956,"SINGAPORE: Moderna's updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that will be used in Singapore as a booster shot will help create antibodies against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants as well, Moderna’s chief medical officer said on Wednesday (Sep 21).
Earlier this month, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) granted interim authorisation to Moderna’s bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine, which targets both the original strain and the BA.1 variant of the coronavirus.
The BA.1 variant was the dominant strain in Singapore in the early parts of the Omicron wave, but the numbers of BA.4 and BA.5 cases have risen.
On Wednesday, Moderna’s chief medical officer Dr Paul Burton told reporters that the company has two boosters – the mRNA-1273.214 that Singapore is receiving, and the mRNA-1273.222.
The mRNA 1273.214 booster targets mainly the original strain and BA.1 variant. It has been authorised in Singapore, the UK, Switzerland, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.
The other booster targets the later BA.4 and BA.5 variants, and is only authorised in the United States.
Dr Burton said the bivalent vaccine that Singapore is receiving also creates “very high” antibody levels against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
He said both boosters are “excellent”, and they target critical members of the Omicron strain. It comes down to what countries or regions want, he added.
Data from the firm was ""extremely reassuring"" that the BA.1 booster also creates high antibody levels against BA.4 and BA.5, said Dr Burton.
HSA said preliminary data from an exploratory analysis suggested that the BA.1 booster may stimulate antibodies against other variants, including the Omicron BA.4, BA.5, Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma.
“(This is) so important, because already now we’re seeing new Omicron subvariants coming along. We already know about this BA2.75.2 variant that has almost complete immune escape against antibodies generated either by natural infection or by early versions of the vaccine,” he said.
“So it’s important that people get vaccinated now and begin to … rebuild that immunity against these new variants.”
As of Tuesday, 93 per cent of Singapore's population has completed the full vaccination regimen, while 80 per cent have received booster shots.
When asked how vaccines will keep up with an evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus, Dr Burton said the original Moderna vaccine created antibodies against the Delta variant, even though it was not created specifically to target Delta.
By creating a bivalent booster that targets both the original virus and BA.1, a broad set of antibodies will be created.

Singapore grants interim authorisation for first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine













Dr Burton said that while there is talk about Omicron being a “mild variant”, that is not true for children. In the first eight months of this year, there were more deaths in children due to COVID-19 than there were in the first eight months of 2020 and 2021 combined.
He added that it will become “absolutely necessary” to have a new vaccine, or an adapted vaccine, every year.
In February this year, Moderna announced plans to set up a new subsidiary in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Dr Burton said there have been “amazing talent” in the region, and people have been appointed.
“I think they are imminent … we have contracts and offers going out to people,” he said, adding that it is on the verge of making an announcement in the “coming weeks”.
IS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC OVER?
Earlier this week, President Joe Biden declared the pandemic over in the United States. Statistics showed that nearly 400 people in the US on average are dying from the virus each day.
Dr Burton said the world is going through a “period of stability”, coming down from very high death rates.
But the coronavirus continues to evolve, taking on characteristics of increased transmission and rapid reproduction, and will “cause problems”, he warned.
“I think we have to be very vigilant and be very mindful about where the virus is going … I would just reiterate to get boosted now and we can’t get our guard down. We have to continue to monitor this virus,” the chief medical officer added.

Restaurant with 'screaming children surcharge' says it has yet to impose fee on guests,"Angie’s Oyster Bar and Grill along Outram Road implemented the S$10 surcharge “a little over a month ago” following increasing complaints from diners.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/angies-oyster-bar-grill-screaming-children-surcharge-diners-complaints-2954911,"SINGAPORE: A restaurant that has imposed a “screaming children surcharge” said that it has yet to impose the fee on any guests and that there have been fewer complaints about misbehaving children since the implementation of the dining policy.
In response to CNA’s queries, Angie’s Oyster Bar and Grill along Outram Road said on Wednesday (Sep 21) that parents have also been “a little more mindful and also make a greater effort to ensure their children are not disturbing other patrons”.
The restaurant implemented the surcharge “a little over a month ago” following increasing complaints from diners. 
A screenshot of a reservation confirmation text message sent to news platform Mothership showed that diners were warned that they will be charged S$10 for screaming or uncontrolled children.
“Prior to the introduction of this policy, we were receiving comments or complaints from other customers on a weekly basis,” the restaurant said.
It added that it “purposefully informs” parents and caretakers of the restaurant's policy when they make a reservation, noting that “99 per cent of our guests are extremely respectful and very understanding of the policy”.
“Majority of our guests understand the policy was introduced with good intentions and appreciate our efforts to make the dining experience enjoyable for everyone and not just a select few,” it said.
While there have been parents or caretakers who disagree with the policy, the restaurant said they see it as “a forewarning” and prepare for the diners’ arrival.
“We understand that we can't please everyone, but we can do our best to deter egocentric behaviours and encourage reciprocal respect between all our guests,” it said.
In a post on review website TripAdvisor on Aug 25, a customer said that they tried to make a reservation at Angie’s, and was told about the surcharge when they indicated that they would be bringing children.
Angie’s reportedly added that they were not “a kids friendly restaurant”.
“This was the first time we were informed of this even though we had been on other occasions,” the customer said. “While I understand that a screaming child would disturb other guests, I thought Angie’s could have taken a more polite approach.”
They added that they were “pretty put off by the reply” and will not return to the restaurant.
In response to the review, Angie’s said the restaurant had received “an increasing number of complaints of children running around unattended or disturbing other people during the service period”.
“Not only is this dangerous as servers are often moving around with hot food and sharp cutlery, but it is also disrespectful to other diners who may wish to dine in a quiet and comfortable atmosphere,” it said.
In its response to CNA queries on Wednesday, the restaurant said its “top priority” has always been to provide a comfortable dining atmosphere for all guests.
“We honestly believe this approach is a win-win for everyone,” it added. 
“We seek parents' and caretakers' kind understanding to take the necessary measures to tend to their children as we aim to provide as many pleasant and memorable dining experiences for as many customers as possible. 
“As long as there is mutual respect from all our guests, everyone has the opportunity to enjoy their dining experience.”

"Driver who beat red light, drove along pavement of park connector for 1.2km jailed","The van driver, who held two jobs, had fallen asleep at the wheel after working overnight. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/van-driver-fell-asleep-wheel-beat-red-light-drove-park-connector-2954366,"SINGAPORE: A van driver who beat a red light after falling asleep at the wheel and drove 1.2km along a pavement of a park connector was jailed for six days on Wednesday (Sep 21). 
Muhammad Ibrahim Abdullah, 27, was also disqualified from driving for 15 months. 
The Singaporean pleaded guilty to one count of driving in a rash manner which endangered human life. 
The court heard that on Apr 19, 2020, Ibrahim drove his van along Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 when he beat a red light at the traffic junction. The van then mounted a curb along the park connector and came to a halt at around 12.30pm. 
Due to his failure to stop, another driver had to brake to avoid colliding with Ibrahim's van. This driver parked his vehicle and approached Ibrahim's side of the van. The driver saw Ibrahim with his head over the steering wheel. 
He knocked on the driver's window and Ibrahim woke up.
""The accused wound down the window of the van, and the ... witness asked the accused if he was okay. The accused replied that he was feeling tired and just wanted to head home,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jocelyn Teo. 
Although he knew that he had mounted the curb, instead of reversing back onto the road, Ibrahim continued driving along the pavement of the park connector for 1.2km. 
After reaching the end of the park connector, Ibrahim came to a stop. A passer-by asked him if he was okay and noted that Ibrahim replied in a slurred manner. 
The passer-by asked him to wait for the police. However, Ibrahim drove back to the road, hitting a railing and a bollard in the process. 
The low concrete wall along the park connector sustained minor graze marks, while the bollard was dented due to Ibrahim's actions. 
No one was injured in the incident. 
The police was alerted to the incident and managed to trace the licence plate of the van to a company. The company informed that Ibrahim was the assigned driver at the time - a fact confirmed by Ibrahim himself later on. 
""The accused explained that he had been working as a lorry driver in his first job from about 10.30pm (on Apr 18) to about 6.30am on Apr 19 and continued in his second job as the driver of the van on Apr 19 at 8am to deliver food parcels,"" said Ms Teo. 
Ibrahim had been on his way home at noon when he fell asleep at the wheel. 
Ibrahim's lawyers A Meenakshi argued that a five-day jail term and a disqualification period of a year would suffice for her client, against the prosecution's proposed sentence of one to two weeks' jail and two years of disqualification. 
Ms Meenakshi said that her client was deeply remorseful and had been forthcoming with the authorities. 
Ibrahim was also the main breadwinner of his family, supporting an ailing mother and mentally ill sister. 
As a delivery rider, Ibrahim relied ""heavily on his ability to drive for his source of income"", said the lawyer. However, this source of income would be affected by the disqualification period. 
For driving in a rash manner to endanger human life, Ibrahim could have been jailed up to a year, or fined up to S$5,000, or both."
"Free health screenings, vaccinations among plans for those enrolled under Healthier SG initiative",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/free-fully-subsidised-health-screenings-vaccinations-singaporeans-under-healthiersg-2951181,"SINGAPORE: As part of a new strategy to drive preventive healthcare for Singapore citizens, those who enrol with a family doctor could get fully subsidised recommended health screenings and vaccinations. 
The Ministry of Health (MOH) submitted a White Paper on the Healthier SG strategy to Parliament on Wednesday (Sep 21) following a public engagement with residents, healthcare professionals, community partners, insurers and other stakeholders over the past six months. The White Paper will be debated in Parliament in October. 
The Healthier SG initiative, which aims to have citizens take charge of their own healthcare, involves having residents enrol with a single doctor, either a general practitioner (GP) or a polyclinic doctor, who will support residents in their health needs throughout their lives. 
Under the plan, residents who enrol in Healthier SG - which is voluntary - can schedule a face-to-face onboarding health consultation, which will be paid for by the Government. Residents will then develop health plans with their doctors, who will continue to monitor the resident's progress via follow-ups.
Health plans will include an overview of the resident's health status, medical needs and health goals and will be followed by an action plan, such as lifestyle adjustments or weight management.
On Wednesday Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told reporters the ministry had consulted thousands of people and taken into consideration feedback from GPs and residents to design the initiative.
Announced during MOH's Committee of Supply Debate 2022 in March, Healthier SG will be open to those 60 and above - roughly 1 million people - to enrol in the second half of 2023. It will gradually be made available to those between 40 and 59 years old in the next two years. 
The strategy is part of the Government's effort to tackle two main challenges - an ageing population and the rising impact of chronic disease - through preventive care. 
By 2030, one in four citizens is expected to be 65 and above, up from one in six today. Chronic diseases, such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, have risen to high levels, at 32 per cent and 37 per cent of the population respectively, said MOH.
The ministry noted that while people who visit a regular family doctor are generally healthier and have fewer visits to emergency departments and hospitals, only three in five Singaporeans have a regular family doctor. 
""We invite residents to go to a GP of your choice. You can choose one near your home. Choose one which is part of your panel of doctors in your company. And then commit to a one-resident, one-doctor or one-clinic relationship,"" said Mr Ong.
He added that a lasting resident-doctor relationship was necessary for preventive care to work.
""Then the doctor will really know your conditions well, and better still know the conditions of your family well, and can do the necessary counselling, persuasion, nagging to help you keep to your health plan.""

RESIDENTS' CONCERNS
According to MOH, two in three of the 6,000 residents consulted for Healthier SG were in support of anchoring with one doctor. Three in four supported having a health plan.
During its engagement with residents, one of the main concerns raised was the cost of regular screenings. 
The Government is addressing this by fully subsidising nationally recommended screenings and vaccinations for Singaporeans. 
As part of the push, MOH is also proposing to waive the requirement for residents to co-pay part of their bills in cash when using MediSave for chronic care management.
Residents suffering from chronic diseases may also get their drugs from the GP clinics they enrol with at prices comparable to polyclinics, as the Government will introduce a new Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) drug subsidy tier for a whitelist of chronic disease management drugs. 
Residents will be allowed to choose a family doctor. They can also switch doctors up to four times in the first two years of enrolment and once a year after that. 
Existing mobile applications HealthHub and Healthy 365 will be enhanced to support the initiative. Through HealthHub, residents will be able to track their health outcomes and key points of discussion with their doctors, while Healthy 365 will be able to track physical activities and diets, as well as support access to community activities. 
Those who complete their first consultation under Healthier SG will receive Healthpoints upon completion. 
As part of the resident's overall health plan, family doctors may refer their residents to community partners that have activities to encourage a healthier lifestyle. 
MOH will provide more services and additional support for seniors through Eldercare Centres by expanding the number from the current 119 to 220 by 2025.

Costs, flexibility in choosing doctors among concerns raised about Singapore’s healthcare reform initiative













HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' CONCERNS
The 1,000 healthcare professionals consulted cited a need for a viable business model to manage the scope of care of patients under them. They were also concerned about the administrative workload and the cost of IT support. 
As part of the proposed plan, family doctors in private practice will receive annual service fees for Healthier SG enrollees based on their health risk profile and the scope of care they need.
The Government will also provide a one-off grant to family doctors to offset the costs of IT adoption to facilitate the sharing of clinical notes, data and the monitoring of patient outcomes. 
Singapore's three healthcare clusters - National Healthcare Group, National University Health System and SingHealth - will support GPs in their region. Clusters will get a pre-determined fee for every resident assigned to them.
This form of payment on a capitation basis - for each enrolled resident rather than for each healthcare service rendered - simplifies funding and allows Healthier SG to be implemented at scale, said Mr Ong.
""Because it is one bundled standard payment, it inherently balances between the GP providing what is needed for the residents, and at the same time, observing cost discipline,"" he said.
MOH said it is working with primary care leaders to develop 12 care protocols to guide the approach to screening, vaccination and managing key chronic conditions, with more to come over time.
Mr Ong said that GPs' recruitment into the initiative has been ""encouraging"" so far. He added that MOH will beef up Singapore's nursing manpower to cater to the increasing demand for healthcare services."

Threat of terrorism remains 'high and increasingly fluid' as networks have grown in sophistication: Ng Eng Hen,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/terrorism-threat-high-fluid-networks-sophistication-mindef-ng-eng-hen-counter-terror-facility-2953446,"SINGAPORE: The threat of terrorism remains ""high and increasingly fluid"" as terror networks have grown in sophistication, said Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen. 
Dr Ng was speaking at the inauguration ceremony for the opening of the Counter-Terrorism Information Facility (CTIF) on Wednesday (Sep 21).
The multilateral, inter-agency facility brings together ""like-minded"" countries to share intelligence and provide early warning against terrorism in the region, said the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).
While much of the facility's operations remain classified for regional security reasons, MINDEF added that it is crucial to ""synergise"" counter-terrorism efforts with the use of collective intelligence and data-driven methods.

Dr Ng said that the CTIF initiative was only possible because of the invaluable contributions of all partners, which demonstrates the ""collective resolve"" to deal with terrorism. 
He also commended the facility on its achievements in detecting the speed of extremist ideologies in the region, which has led to follow-up actions by regional security agencies. 
Since beginning its operations in January 2021, CTIF has produced timely intelligence products with partner nations, and has assisted the region in the collective effort against terrorism, said MINDEF. 
Dr Ng also met representatives from partner nations at the inauguration ceremony and thanked them for their strong support.

Man on trial for sexually assaulting younger man who lay on his floor drunk,"Jeffrey Pe took advantage of the fact that the younger man had just broken up with his girlfriend, and was looking to meet other women, said the prosecution. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sexual-assault-drunk-younger-man-celebrating-ord-2953796,"SINGAPORE: The trial for a man accused of sexually assaulting a man half his age and fresh out of national service opened on Wednesday (Sep 21), with the prosecution charging that the older man had exploited the alleged victim's  trusting nature. 
Jeffrey Pe, a 45-year-old Singaporean, faces three charges of sexually penetrating the victim, then aged 20, as he lay inebriated on the floor of Pe's flat on Aug 9, 2017. 
The victim cannot be named due to a gag order protecting his identity. 
Opening its case on Wednesday, Deputy Public Prosecutors David Khoo and Tay Jia En said that Pe had sexually assaulted the victim when he was at his most vulnerable. 
""The accused had learnt that the victim had recently broken up with his girlfriend and was therefore looking to meet new people (girls in particular). 
""The accused thereafter gained the victim’s trust by showing that he was a sociable and extroverted person who could introduce the victim to people to expand the victim’s social network,"" said the prosecution. 
However, at a night out to celebrate the victim's completion of his full-time national service, Pe allegedly sexually assaulted the victim. 
""Every Singaporean son will fondly remember his Operationally Ready Date, where he is formally released from full-time National Service duties.
""Alas, not so for the then 20-year-old victim. Instead of fond memories, the victim is instead left with indelible scars of National Day 2017, and he had to seek professional help to overcome the trauma he received from the incident,"" said the prosecution. 
According to the prosecution, Pe and the victim first met at a pub around Jul 23, 2017. 
At the time, the victim had just broken up with his girlfriend and wanted to know more women. He befriended Pe who appeared connected with a woman he was interested in.
The two exchanged numbers after Pe invited both the victim and the woman to his birthday party on Jul 29, 2017. They conversed over WhatsApp in the meantime. 





Pe met the victim at a bar on Jul 30 to celebrate the former's birthday.  
On Aug 6, 2017, the victim allegedly wanted to meet Pe to drink, but the older man fell asleep before they could meet. Pe apologised and both agreed to meet two days later for drinks. 
On Aug 8, the victim met Pe at night and they consumed alcoholic drinks in the Chinatown area before the victim allegedly asked to sleep at Pe's residence. 
The prosecution said it would lead evidence to show that on Aug 9, Pe made the victim an alcoholic drink and offered the younger man a change of clothes and his bed to sleep in. The victim allegedly declined the clothes and the bed, falling asleep on the floor of Pe's bedroom in his own clothing. 
He awoke sometime later to find that his jeans and underwear had been pulled down, and Pe was sexually assaulting him, the prosecution alleged. 
Drifting in and out of consciousness, the victim mustered the strength to push Pe away. The victim then went to the toilet to wash himself, disgusted with what had happened, the prosecution continued. 
The victim later called a friend and confided that Pe had ""raped"" him. The victim called the police on Aug 9, at about 5.47am, stating: ""A guy just tried to rape me. I have known him for a few weeks, he was very intoxicated. He is at home right now."" 
Pe was arrested at his apartment at about 10.30am. 
The prosecution will lead evidence from analysts from the Health Sciences Authority to show that while the victim's blood sample contained 40 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood, no ethanol was detected in Pe's blood sample when it was taken. 
An Institute of Mental Health consultant will give evidence that the victim was likely to have been intoxicated between 4.15am and 5.30am on Aug 9, and was therefore unable to consent to the sexual acts. 
A psychiatrist will testify that she diagnosed the victim with generalised anxiety disorder with possible post-traumatic stress symptoms following the incident. 
The victim testified in camera on Wednesday. The prosecution will lead evidence from 26 witnesses in total. 
Pe is represented by lawyer Amarjit Singh. The trial continues on Wednesday afternoon. 
If convicted of sexual assault by penetration, Pe may be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned."
Deadline for companies to conduct mandatory safety-time out extended to Sep 30: MOM,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mandatory-safety-time-out-deadline-extended-sep-30-mom-workplaces-2953701,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has given companies 15 more days to conduct a mandatory safety time-out, after receiving feedback that more time is required to review safety procedures. 
This extends the deadline to Sep 30. From Oct 1, the Manpower Ministry will conduct compliance checks and will take debarment actions against companies that are found to have not completed their mandatory safety time-out, said the ministry in a Facebook post. 
MOM announced earlier this month that companies in higher-risk sectors would be required to conduct a mandatory safety time-out to review safety procedures from Sep 1 to Sep 15, as part of the measures introduced under the heightened safety period. 
Companies that failed to do so would be debarred from employing new foreign employees for a month. It was the first time a mandatory safety time-out had been imposed. 
The requirement applies to all companies in the construction, manufacturing, marine, process or transport and storage industries as well as industries that use heavy or industrial vehicles. 
MOM said on Wednesday that the ministry and the Workplace Safety and Health Council had received feedback that the industries were supportive of the heightened safety measures but needed more time to comply with the mandatory safety time-out to carry out a thorough review of their safety procedures. 
""Safety is our priority and MOM will partner the industries to build safer workplaces.""
The ministry added that those that need guidance can refer to the safety time-out checklist at go.gov.sg/stochecklist. They can also sign up for the StartSAFE programme for a consultant to conduct a risk assessment at the workplace. 
A total of 28 people died in workplace incidents in the first half of the year, putting the fatality rate per 100,000 workers higher than two six-month periods prior.
More than half of the deaths reported from January to June this year were a result of falls from height and vehicular-related incidents . 
MOM said it was concerned with the high rate of fatality and called for a six-month period of heightened safety from Sep 1 to Feb 28, 2023.

Man who stabbed ex-girlfriend to death in Jurong East gets jail,"The man continued to attack his ex-girlfriend even after a passer-by rode a personal mobility device into him.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-stabbing-ex-girlfriend-death-jurong-east-2953621,"SINGAPORE: A 37-year-old man was sentenced to 12 years' jail on Wednesday (Sep 21) after he stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death in Jurong East in February last year.
Zheng Xianfeng attacked his ex-girlfriend Tham Mee Yoke and continued swinging his knife at her even though a passer-by rode a personal mobility device (PMD) into him in an attempt to stop the assault.
Tham died of her injuries after she was taken to hospital.
Zheng, a Chinese national, was jailed on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to one count of culpable homicide not amounting to the murder of Tham.
Four other charges, including causing annoyance while drunk, causing hurt to his brother, and injuring Tham with a penknife in an earlier incident, were taken into consideration for the sentencing. 
Zheng and Tham first met as flatmates in December 2018 and they began dating after a dinner gathering.
Their relationship went smoothly until August 2020 when they began quarrelling, arguing over minor issues and suspecting each other of cheating. 
On Nov 17, 2020, after an argument, Tham wanted to break up with Zheng and packed her bags to move out. Zheng, who was then intoxicated, took out a penknife and stabbed himself in the right thigh.
He also pinned Tham down and attacked her, and she suffered a 15cm cut from the assault. Zheng was arrested for causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.
After the incident, Zheng sought Tham at her new residence in a bid to salvage the relationship. In one such meeting, Zheng saw that Tham was texting another man on her phone and assaulted her again. 
On the morning of Feb 16, 2021, Zheng took leave from work as he was thinking about his ongoing court cases and his relationship issues. He headed home at noon and started drinking beer.
He received a message from Tham, telling him not to harass her in the future.
""The accused messaged the victim, stating that she appeared happy after they broke up, while he felt unhappy and lonely,"" Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia told the court. 
Zheng continued drinking beer before leaving his house with a 26.5cm-long knife tucked into his trousers. He bought snacks and more alcohol and drank in public. 
At around 10pm, he went to a residents' corner near the victim's residence and resumed drinking while waiting for her. The victim arrived at the void deck of Block 308, Jurong East Street 32, near midnight.
Three men who were in the area witnessed Zheng walking quickly towards Tham. One of them called the police as he spotted the knife tucked into Zheng's pants. 
Tham raised her hands while backing away from Zheng. He then took out the knife and began stabbing her multiple times in the chest and abdomen.
One of the three witnesses rode his PMD into Zheng to try and stop him. 
""In response to the impact, the accused momentarily stopped his attack, but thereafter quickly resumed stabbing the victim’s upper body repeatedly again. The accused repeatedly stabbed the victim in her chest and abdomen with the intention of causing her death,"" Ms Teo said. 
Tham's screams caught the attention of six other residents, some of whom called the police.
After realising that Tham was motionless, Zheng ran away with the knife. He cut himself on his left forearm twice. 
He then removed his clothes and passed out on a grass patch near Block 307, Jurong East Street 32. One of the three men gave chase but lost sight of Zheng. Another man, who was training as a nurse, applied pressure on Tham's neck.
Paramedics took Tham to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where she died of her injuries at about 1.30am on Feb 17, 2021.
An autopsy report showed she suffered at least 19 stab wounds and 10 incised wounds, along with three rib fractures.
Zheng was arrested by police officers and a blood sample was taken from him. According to court documents, he was in a state of acute alcohol intoxication at the time of the offence.
The man was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health and diagnosed with major depressive disorder.
The major depressive disorder and acute alcohol intoxication did not compromise Zheng's awareness that his actions were morally and legally wrong, according to court documents. He was also aware of the ""nature, quality and wrongness"" of his actions, the documents added.
Ms Teo sought 10 to 12 years' jail for Zheng, while his lawyer Leo Cheng Suan, argued for a term of between eight and 10 years. 
Mr Leo said that his client came to Singapore to earn a living and started working as a car painter, which was why he had a penknife. 
He said that the couple had rekindled their relationship but they quarrelled often. Zheng had also been troubled by another girlfriend in China, who had bought a house with his money and became uncontactable. 
""After he killed her he did a bizarre thing - he slashed himself, took off all his clothes (and) just wanted to die. He had all these suicidal thoughts. When I visited him he wanted the death penalty, he was just so remorseful after the events,"" said Mr Leo. 
For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Zheng could have been jailed for life and caned, or jailed for up to 20 years, fined, or caned."

"Singapore, India to cooperate in new areas, including food and energy security: Lawrence Wong","The Deputy Prime Minister said the inaugural India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable can serve as the new platform for regular meetings between both sides and coordination of new areas of partnership moving forward.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-india-cooperate-new-areas-food-energy-security-lawrence-wong-2952341,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and India have agreed to cooperate in several new areas, ranging from food and energy security, green technology to digital connectivity, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Sep 20).
Speaking to journalists after a five-day visit to India, he added that the inaugural India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable can serve as the platform for regular meetings between both sides and to coordinate new areas of partnership moving forward.
Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, said Singapore has been in talks with India on how to strengthen the relationship between both countries, but the COVID-19 pandemic put many of these plans on hold for the past two and a half years.
“With the COVID situation improving in both our countries, we were able to resume discussions,” he said, adding that both countries eventually decided on a new high-level ministerial roundtable as a way to strengthen cooperation.
“That’s why I was very happy this time to be able to come here to launch the roundtable and to meet with my counterparts.
“We had very candid, very wide-ranging discussions across a wide range of areas, and we also agreed on several new areas of cooperation, including on food and energy security, on green technology, particularly green hydrogen, on digital connectivity and skills development,” he said.
Mr Wong noted that Singapore and India have “complementary strengths” in several areas.
Citing financial technology (fintech) as an example, he described India as having “considerable potential” given its efforts in digitalisation and “explosive growth” in the start-up space.
Singapore has also been growing its fintech ecosystem. While Singapore may be “a much smaller market”, the country serves the broader region given its role as a financial centre, said Mr Wong.
This means possibilities for both sides to collaborate in fintech – an area that will be given a boost by the new agreement signed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and India’s International Financial Services Centres Authority over the weekend.
 
“(Fintech companies) can experiment, they can test, they can innovate through a regulatory sandbox in both Gift City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) and Singapore, and potentially scale their solutions in both jurisdictions,” he added.
Mr Wong also expressed his hopes for the high-level ministerial roundtable, held for the first time as part of his visit, to be an annual event moving forward.
“We want the ministerial roundtable to be a standing arrangement for ministers on both sides to meet on a regular basis,” he added, although he stressed that the meeting will take on a “flexible” format that can adapt to changing needs and demands.
For example, the Deputy Prime Minister was joined by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong, and Minister for Transport and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran at the roundtable. The Singapore ministers met their Indian counterparts in the three areas of foreign affairs, finance and trade and industry, but future meetings could include more ministers depending on the areas discussed, said Mr Wong.
The ministers were also joined by business leaders from both countries this time.
“We are working out the frequency of the meetings, but it is likely to be an annual event. The format of it – who are the participating ministers, whether business delegations are joining us – these are things that we will evolve and adjust from year to year,” Mr Wong said.

Singapore and India to partner in fintech innovations













Asked about the role that India can play in the region, the Deputy Prime Minister noted that India has increased and intensified cooperation across multiple fronts with regional countries since it announced its “Look East” policy in the early 1990s.
The policy was later renamed “Act East” in 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.
“There is broad recognition in India that a significant part of India’s interest lies to the east of India,” said Mr Wong. “So, we welcome India's participation in the broader region. We see India playing a larger role in this evolving regional architecture for Asian cooperation.”
A growing economic weight – which some reports have estimated for India to become the world's third-largest economy after the US and China by 2030 – could also see India taking on a larger role in regional and international affairs, he added.
Meanwhile, India will be assuming the presidency role for the Group of 20 meetings next year, meaning that the country will play a bigger leadership role in tackling global issues, be it climate change or pandemic response, Mr Wong said.
“On Singapore’s part, we have always believed in India as a strategically important partner and that’s why we’ve had close ties all these many decades, and it’s a relationship built on deep reservoirs of mutual trust,” he added.
“As country coordinator for ASEAN-India relations (from 2021 to 2024), we hope to see India be engaged in ASEAN in a more constructive and systematic manner and we … look forward to India becoming an important player in this evolving regional architecture.”

"'Flexibility is key': Why MNCs, government offices are turning to co-working spaces",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/co-working-space-wework-justco-iwg-office-space-2944271,"SINGAPORE: Ms Mildred Ang, who works at Klook Singapore, will sometimes head to a “hideout” at the co-working space where her company is based, for some alone time to think about “abstract stuff”.
This hideout could be a wellness room or an outdoor rooftop garden, where she can be away from her co-workers for one or two hours, she said.
“I then have the ability, or the flexibility, to come up to our team to continue the discussion or have a different brainstorm session,” said Ms Ang, who is the travel e-commerce firm’s partnership and affiliates lead.
“I think that's one of the greatest benefits.”
Klook, which employs about 100 people in Singapore, has been leasing one floor from a co-working space here for the past two years. Employees can also use desks at all the branches of the co-working chain, which Klook requested not to name.
Ms Cary Shek, the firm’s vice-president for people and culture, said that when Klook entered the Singapore market a few years ago, employees worked out of a shophouse. But as the team expanded, that became impractical.
It wanted a space that would better facilitate collaboration and mingling among team members, and found that a co-working space could also provide more flexibility compared with leased office premises.
“As a fast-moving company, efficiency is so important to us. Time (is) required to set up a new office and … maintain it. We do need to make a call - where do we want our people to focus on,” she said.
“A co-working space provides us with the scalability … (and) allows us to optimise the space, like when our business keeps expanding.”
MULTINATIONALS, LARGE COMPANIES
Besides companies like Klook, multinational companies are also shifting to co-working spaces.
Mr Michael Sim, vice-president and head of JustCo in Singapore and Korea, said that half of JustCo’s members are from MNCs, while the other half are a mix of start-ups and SMEs.
“Unlike a few years ago, nowadays we have observed more and more MNCs embracing flex space as a primary option for their office space usage,” he said.
Standard Chartered Bank’s 10,000 employees in Singapore can work at offices nearer their homes, provided by flex space provider IWG, while the bank maintains primary offices at Marina Bay Financial Tower 1 and Changi Business Park.
“The way we work has evolved during the pandemic and through actively listening to our colleagues, we have taken a more agile approach to our real estate strategy,” said a bank spokesperson.
Through its arrangement with IWG, the bank’s workers have access to 3,500 IWG office locations around the world.
Mr Brian Richards, Standard Chartered’s head of resourcing in Singapore, said he meets up with colleagues at the bank’s primary offices, and at times, uses co-working spaces as an alternative to working from home and for team off-site meetings.
“I appreciate the availability of diverse conducive spaces to support my various work needs, and the change in environment is refreshing and boosts productivity,” said Mr Richards.
DEMAND FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS
IWG said that there is increased interest from companies of all sizes – MNCs, SMEs or start-ups – for co-working spaces.
In Singapore, IWG’s on-demand membership sales rose by 85 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022.
“In fact, 83 per cent of the Fortune 500 use our services, and a fair share of them have multi-market presence that includes Singapore,” said Mr Darren Rogers, country manager for IWG here.
WeWork, which just opened a new 220,000 sq ft space at Collyer Quay, has also seen demand grow. In the second quarter of this year, it had close to 90 per cent occupancy in Singapore, a 25 percentage-point increase from the previous quarter, said Mr Balder Tol, general manager for Australia and Southeast Asia.
And enterprises make up more than half its business in Singapore, Mr Tol said.
“What I have noticed is that companies of all sizes are still in the process of redefining their workplace strategies,” said Mr Tol. 
“What we are seeing across all businesses is the preference for flexible leases to reduce their reliance on traditional real estate, driven by rising operational costs.”
Like IWG, their clients range from MNCs and large enterprises to SMEs and start-ups. Both firms said that there is great demand from the finance and tech sectors.
In addition, Mr Tol noted that there is also interest from the pharmaceutical industry and even government agencies, for example the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth is using flexible space at WeWork.

Open Government Products, a division of GovTech, is operating out of WeWork City House at Robinson Road.
Mr Joshua Tan, senior manager of corporate operations, told CNA that the division's more than 110 workers moved from Mapletree Business City to WeWork at Funan, then to City House in March this year.
Mr Tan said that the offices that were offered to the division for lease were not as conducive for work, citing “cubicles and drab hospital walls, low ceilings”.

WeWork also offered services that would have required it to hire more people to manage office space, he said. Like Klook, one other consideration was scalability as the Open Government Products team was rapidly expanding.
“Many people on our team go to various WeWork (spaces) around the island, or even around the world,” he said.
“Ultimately we believe in providing the best spaces for our team to effectively work, communicate and bond whether this is physical, virtual or hybrid.”
DECENTRALISATION, WORK ON WEEKENDS
Co-working spaces said that there is also a growing preference to have offices closer to homes.
Visits to IWG centres outside the city centre jumped by close to 60 per cent between February and August this year, said Mr Rogers. 
Visits to its latest Regus centre, at Hiap Hoe Building in Balestier, jumped by 240 per cent since its opening in April.
JustCo’s Mr Sim said that in the past, most users tended to work from a selected primary JustCo centre, but now more users are “toggling” among its 18 locations in Singapore. 
“This is clearly a reflection of the increasing popularity of work-from-anywhere.”

Mr Rogers said that more customers are also using IWG centres on the weekends, and for some spaces, weekend visits could reach up to 50 per cent of weekday visits.
Analysts agreed that flexibility was a decisive benefit for companies that opt for co-working spaces.
“Flexibility is a key advantage as it allows co-working space users the option to scale up or down, while traditional office leases lock a tenant down for a minimum three years, coupled with the consideration for a longer amortisation period for their fit-outs,” said Mr Desmond Sim, CEO of real estate consulting firm Edmund Tie.
A co-working space may also give the smaller companies convenient access to a prestigious address, which is “key for talent attraction”.
When asked to compare the costs of using a co-working space versus leasing an office, he said that it varies for location and extent of use, but there is less upfront cost when using a subscription model.
“In general, a typical cost plan for a co-working space may be quite even and spread out, paid on an annual basis, while a traditional lease will have to incur higher setup costs … at the lease commencement,” he said.

Commentary: Professional networking should not look the same in this hybrid work era













Ms Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy at JLL Singapore, said that flexible workspace operators have resumed their expansion paths in 2022 after a couple of lean years due to the pandemic. 
“The current uncertain operating climate including the still evolving future of work has helped bolstered the demand for flexible workspace,” she said.
The Work Project is to open a new 50,000 sq ft facility at Battery Road in October, and JustCo has plans for a new 50,000 sq ft facility at International Plaza in end-2022 or early 2023. The Great Room will also be opening a new facility at South Bridge Road at the end of the year.
Besides their rising popularity with MNCs and large corporates, other companies may look to flexible space as an interim solution while they determine how they intend to occupy space in the medium to long term, Ms Tay added. 
“There are also occupiers who are unsure of what the future of work looks like to them and chose to experiment with hybrid working within a co-work space to avoid spending unnecessary capital expenditure altering existing spaces,” she said.
Much of this is driven by the move towards hybrid work post-pandemic, both analysts and company representatives said.
Ms Shek said that for Klook, the COVID-19 pandemic “reinforced” the benefits of using a co-working space.
“Pre-pandemic, no one will expect that we can work virtually five days a week from home or from anywhere,” she said.
“The pandemic further reinforced the benefits of using a co-working space for our (company’s) stage of development. It may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it really depends on the organisation’s needs and business needs.”"
"Property prices near new MRT stations on Cross Island Line expected to rise, higher en bloc potential: Analysts","King Albert Park, Clementi and West Coast areas will likely see a slight boost of up to 3 per cent in prices and more price gains of up to 5 per cent, says a property analyst.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-prices-near-mrt-stations-cross-island-line-phase-2-rise-en-bloc-potential-analysts-2951916,"SINGAPORE: The completion of six more MRT stations on the Cross Island Line (CRL) will likely boost property prices in the areas and older condominiums may now have higher en bloc potential, said property analysts.
Transport Minister S Iswaran announced on Tuesday (Sep 19) that six new stations - Turf City, King Albert Park, Maju, Clementi, West Coast and Jurong Lake District - will form Phase 2 of the Cross Island Line.  
Construction is expected to start next year and the stations will open by 2032. Once completed, it is expected to benefit about 40,000 households living in those areas. 
Property analysts CNA spoke to said the announcement is expected to lift the property prices of private homes near the new stations while older condominiums may also see higher en bloc potential. 
Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, said the announcement will give buyers a firmer timeline on when the stations are expected to be completed, which will help them make more informed decisions. 
“Prices of some condos near MRT stations may also rise when the MRT stations are completed. This is because the value of a project is being enhanced when these homes are leased for rental income in the future and projects near MRT stations are usually popular among tenants,” she added.
Mr Lee Sze Teck, Huttons Asia's senior director for research, estimated that the King Albert Park, Clementi and West Coast areas will see a slight boost of up to 3 per cent in prices and more price gains of up to 5 per cent when the stations are completed in 2032.
He noted that the six stations are planned either in future housing areas or in existing high-traffic areas. 
Property analyst Ong Kah Seng said that before the announcement, prices of homes near the new stations were already expected to grow by about 5 per cent over the next 10 years.
But with the news confirming the MRT locations, he expects prices to increase by about 15 per cent over 10 years.
""With this official announcement, the net effect on future price gains will be more pronounced, visible and tangible,"" he added.
""For those properties that are slightly away from the MRT stations, their prices are expected to grow by about a total of 8-10 per cent in the next 10 years.""











Spanning 15km, the six stations will improve connectivity for residents in the west, including areas such as Sunset Way and West Coast that are not currently served by an MRT line, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) earlier on Tuesday. 
Two of the stations will be interchanges, with King Albert Park connecting to the Downtown Line while Clementi will link to the East-West line.
Having an MRT station at Turf City comes as no surprise as the area had already been identified as a future housing area, said Mr Lee, adding that land parcels in Turf City could be offered for sale as early as 2026 and 2027. 
The 140ha site in Bukit Timah had been slated for residential use as part of the 1998 Master Plan. 
Ms Sun said: ""There could be a possibility of public housing especially since their lease is coming to an end in 2023 and the site is slated for residential use.""
""The MRT station will boost connectivity in Turf City and increase the attractiveness of homes in the area ... The public housing may be located away from the Good Class Bungalow areas,"" said Mr Lee. 
Mr Ong said future housing developments at Turf City could be similar to those in Woodleigh, for instance, where there are major condominium developments along with HDB flats. 
Turf City is currently occupied by 15 tenants for various uses including retail, F&B, sports and recreation, childcare centres and motor vehicle showrooms. 
Tenants at Turf City were given a final 18-month extension of their lease until Dec 31, 2023, last year. 
People staying in the east and north-east will benefit the most from the launch of the new MRT stations, said Ms Sun.
""There has been quite a number of new condos and public housing built in Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Pasir Ris. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance their connectivity with the rest of the island,"" she said.
The Cross Island Line is Singapore's eighth MRT line and the longest fully underground line at more than 50km. It will be constructed in three phases.

"Two adults given undiluted COVID-19 vaccine at Hougang clinic, one discharged after hospitalisation: MOH","The clinic under ProHealth Medical Group and the doctor who administered the COVID-19 vaccine have been suspended from the national vaccination programme until further notice.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/two-adults-undiluted-covid-19-vaccine-hougang-clinic-hospitalised-moh-2951911,"SINGAPORE: Two adults were each given a full vial of the undiluted Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic in Hougang, with one needing hospitalisation after experiencing headache and increased heart rate, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Sep 20).
Responding to CNA’s queries, the ministry said that it was alerted to the incident on Monday, which took place at a clinic under the ProHealth Medical Group on Sep 15.
“One was hospitalised after experiencing headache and increased heart rate and has since been discharged. The other patient did not report any adverse reaction,” said MOH.
MOH said that it takes a serious view of this incident and is carrying out a thorough investigation.
“The clinic and doctor who administered the vaccine have been suspended from the National Vaccination Programme until further notice,” the ministry added.
After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contain six doses of 0.3ml of vaccine, according to Singapore's Health Sciences Authority.
Speaking to Mediacorp's Channel 8 News, Mr Lim Tau Chiew, 57, said he had experienced headache and increased heart rate.
""I felt the side of my body cramping up, even to the point I felt my pulse quickening and my heart beat was increasing,"" said Mr Lim.
""I called my daughter for help and we waited for the ambulance to send me to the hospital.""
According to Channel 8 News, the doctor involved is a locum and comes in twice a month. She has been working at the clinic for around two years.
CNA has contacted the clinic for more information.
In a separate incident last year, MOH said it was conducting a ""thorough investigation"" after a 103-year-old woman was erroneously given a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
The woman was admitted to Changi General Hospital for pneumonia and hyponatremia, and was subsequently also diagnosed to have suffered a stroke. She died the following month.
Last year, an employee at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine due to a human error.
Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects, SNEC had said.

"Doctor who took more than 3,200 upskirt videos struck off medical register","Chu Ben Wee was sentenced to three years’ jail in December 2020 after he was convicted of four charges of outrage of modesty for taking upskirt videos of women using a shoe he had modified to conceal a camera.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-who-took-more-3200-upskirt-videos-struck-medical-register-disciplinary-tribunal-2951726,"SINGAPORE: A doctor who was found to have taken more than 3,200 upskirt videos was struck off the medical register in July, a disciplinary tribunal for the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) said.
In grounds made available on Tuesday (Sep 20), the tribunal said the strike off order against Chu Ben Wee would “not only be proportionate” to the severity of his offences but also “necessary for it to be a strong deterrence”.
“We had to consider whether the reputation of the profession would be placed at risk, if members of the public became aware that a member of the profession who has committed these offences on so many occasions, is still allowed to remain on the rolls after a disciplinary hearing,” they said.
A striking off order removes a medical professional from the official register, which bars them from practicing their profession. 
Chu was sentenced to three years’ jail in December 2020 after he was convicted of four charges of outrage of modesty for taking upskirt videos of women using a shoe he had modified to conceal a GoPro camera.
He took the videos at places like hospitals, malls and junior colleges – including an incident in which he wore a uniform to pose as a student during a career fair at Victoria Junior College (VJC) while on bail. 
In total, he was arrested three times.
In view of his offences, the SMC proposed that Chu’s name be removed from the Register of Medical Practitioners, as well as to pay the costs and expenses related to the proceedings, including the costs of solicitors for the Council.
Chu countered in his mitigation plea that a suspension of 13 months – with “the other usual consequential orders” – is “fair and appropriate”. His lawyer also proposed a suspension of 13 to 14 months.
“PREMEDITATED AND ELABORATE MANNER” OF OFFENCES
However, the tribunal said in its grounds that there were factors in his case that caused harm to public confidence in the medical professions. 
They noted that he recorded the videos on at least 630 occasions, aggravated by the fact that the offences took place in multiple locations and over a long period of time. It was also highlighted that he reoffended twice after he was first arrested in January 2018.
In their submissions, lawyers for the SMC said Chu’s actions had “severe consequences as they erode public confidence in the medical profession to a serious extent because of the large number of victims, potential harm caused to those victims, and that the victims included students in a junior college within their own school campus”.
They also pointed out the “premeditated and elaborate manner” in which he went about recording the videos to avoid detection.
The tribunal had considered the “extent and nature” of Chu’s actions in issuing the striking off order and recognised the fact that the offences were committed in both a professional and a public setting.
“We were particularly disturbed by the extent of the deception which he employed to keep his criminal activity under wraps,” the tribunal said.
They noted that the methods he used “demonstrated extreme sophistication” in enabling him to record the videos and avoid detection and punishment.
“What was particularly disturbing to us was that after his Jan 18, 2018 arrest and while investigations are ongoing, (Chu) not only failed to stop in his criminal conduct, he continued to perpetuate it,” the tribunal said, adding that his lack of self-awareness and insight led to his second arrest.
“Unfortunately, (his) conduct did not stop even after he was out on bail. Just three months later … he was found to have put up an extremely elaborate ruse to move around undetected in a junior college.”
The tribunal pointed out the advance planning he took to purchase a uniform and equipment, as well as choosing the day of the career fair “as it would be easy for him to go into the school and move around undetected”.
Chu not only “failed to express remorse at an early stage”, but also allowed his urges to get the better of him and continued to offend, allowing it to escalate to the incident at VJC.
The tribunal added that Chu’s actions showed that he “lacked insight”, as he had more than ample opportunity to reflect on his conduct and seek help to control his urges after his first two arrests.
While they acknowledged that he may be under the impression that there is stigma associated with seeking psychiatric help, they did not agree that there is “sufficient excuse of justification” for him not to do so between arrests.
“If he knew that it was a problem, he could and should have sought help at an early stage,” they said. “Instead, he allowed his misconduct to escalate which was extremely unfortunate.”
The tribunal, however, said that the striking off order does not mean the end of Chu’s medical career, adding that he could apply to restore his name to the register three years after the date of his removal.
ARRESTED THREE TIMES
Chu was first arrested on Jan 18, 2018, at Novena Square 2 mall, where he used his shoe to record an upskirt video. Police found at least 2,900 upskirt videos on Chu’s devices during a search of his home the following day, including several taken at two hospitals. 
They also seized his modified shoes – a black pair from Decathlon with a small hole on the right side – and a camera. 
On Apr 27, 2019, while still under investigation for the prior offences, he was arrested again at Plaza Singapura for using a GoPro camera concealed in his shoe to record upskirt videos. Police seized several items from Chu, including an iPhone, the GoPro, the shoes and a memory card.
He was arrested again for the same offence on Jul 31 at VJC, while out on bail. He had bought a VJC round collar t-shirt and a pair of long pants to disguise himself as a student and took 97 upskirt videos of students using a camera inside his shoe.
He was caught after two students alerted a teacher to him. A group of teachers found him behind the school hall, during which he claimed to be from the Ministry of Defence and that he was manning a booth at the career fair. After further questioning, he changed his answer and said he was just a visitor.
Teachers called the police, who questioned Chu. He then claimed that he was simply there to attend the career fair and wore the VJC attire to avoid standing out.
SMC’s lawyers argued that there was a “high” culpability in Chu’s case, due to his intentional and deliberate state of mind. 
However, Chu’s lawyer submitted several mitigation factors, namely that he pleaded guilty “at the first earliest opportunity” and fully cooperated with the investigations and disciplinary tribunal proceedings.
He also noted that Chu suffers from paraphilic disorder, specifically a voyeuristic disorder, which was agreed upon by two doctors. 
He had “never stopped seeking treatment” and sees the prison psychologist weekly. Additionally, Chu “practices medication and continues his research on further steps he can take to address his disorder”, his lawyer said.
However, the tribunal did not agree with Chu’s lawyer, who said that there was only moderate harm because Chu “acknowledged that his offences would undermine public confidence to the medical profession” and because “there was no patients involved and no actual injury or harm caused”. 
“We found this argument both flippant and factually wrong,” they said."

Consumers of pre-packaged drinks may have to pay 10-20 cent deposit under proposed recycling scheme
Consumers of pre-packaged beverages may have to pay 10 to 20 cents more as a deposit for their drinks if a proposed scheme is implemented. 
In its initial stages, it will likely involve only metal cans and plastic bottles, with a flat deposit amount applied to each container regardless of size. 
Consumers will be able to get their deposit back upon returning the can or bottle to designated return points.
The proposed beverage container return scheme is currently in its consultation phase. After details are firmed up, the scheme will likely be rolled out by mid-2024.
The scheme will not apply to drinks prepared on the spot, such as bubble tea. Other recyclable materials, such as beverage cartons and glass bottles, may be considered at a later phase. 
Woman who brandished knife at police during stand-off in Tampines to be charged in court
The woman who stabbed herself during a stand-off with the police outside St Hilda's Secondary School in Tampines on Monday (Sep 19) will be charged in court with possession of offensive weapons in a public place.
Two knives were seized from the 53-year-old.
The offence of possession of an offensive weapon carries a jail term of up to three years and caning. However, she cannot be caned as she is a woman.

'Small handful' of safe-distancing ambassadors left, almost all have returned to other sectors: MSE
Only a ""small handful"" of safe-distancing ambassadors in Singapore are left, due to contractual arrangements, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said on Tuesday (Sep 20). It added that almost all have returned to other sectors.
Since April this year, the ministry has been stepping down the deployment of safe-distancing ambassadors and helping them seek alternative employment.
However, enforcement officers will continue to be deployed to conduct checks and investigations on violations of safe management measures.
Only such officers have the authority to conduct enforcement against violations of safe management measures."

The 53-year-old will be charged with possession of offensive weapons in a public place, said the police in a media release on Tuesday.
Police were called to the scene along Tampines Street 82 at about 6.30pm on Monday. 
“During the engagement with the officers, the woman purportedly brandished a knife at the officers, and used the same knife to stab herself in her abdomen,” police said.
""Despite verbal commands to the woman to place the knife down, the woman allegedly disregarded the officers’ instructions, continued to brandish the knife and placed the knife on her neck and threatened to harm herself further.""
One of the officers then deployed a Taser on the woman, the police said, adding that two knives were later seized from her.

When CNA arrived at the scene at around 7pm, the woman was seen screaming in pain. She was in a green shirt, which was stained with what appeared to be blood around the torso region.
At least two police cars and about 10 police officers were there. Some of them were seen carrying what appeared to be submachine guns.











Eyewitnesses told CNA the woman was waving around an object that looked like a knife. She was shouting at the police who told her to drop her weapon.
Shortly after at 7.40pm, the woman was put on a stretcher and taken into an ambulance.

"Woman fined S$100,000 for lapses in workplace safety that led to her worker's fatal electrocution",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-fined-lapses-workplace-safety-measures-electrician-died-electrocuted-court-2951061,"SINGAPORE: A woman was fined $100,000 by a court on Tuesday (Sep 20) in relation to the death of a worker who was electrocuted while replacing a roller shutter.
Lee Ee Ten, 65, was the employer of the deceased electrician, Mr Tong Baorong. She pleaded guilty to one count of failing to take measures necessary to ensure the safety and health of her employees at work, thereby causing Mr Tong's death.
The court heard that Lee was a partner at Tan Kim Seng Roller Shutters, which repaired and replaced motors of roller shutters.
In early November 2019, a construction company hired Tan Kim Seng to replace the motor of a roller shutter at the Tritech Building in 31 Changi South Avenue 2.
Lee, who was in charge of her company's operations and safety and health matters, deployed a team comprising Mr Tong and two other workers to the site.
At about 9.30am, on Nov 7, 2019, they arrived at the building. Mr Tong climbed an aluminium ladder to turn off the isolator of the roller shutter's motor and began replacing the motor.
The ladder was about 5.9m long and was placed at an angle against the frame of the roller shutter. The other two workers helped Mr Tong by holding onto his ladder and giving him the replacement motor.
About 10 minutes later, Mr Tong successfully mounted the motor and connected it to the isolator. As the metal frame of the motor was connected to the live terminal of the main electricity supply, the frame and all conductive materials including the aluminium ladder became live when Mr Tong turned on the isolator.
He fell of the ladder instantly and landed face down on the ground, court documents said. He was taken to hospital but died later that morning of electrocution with multiple injuries.
""At all material times, Mr Tong did not open the isolator cover to check the wiring configuration,"" said the prosecutor. 
""He had assumed that the electricity supply from the isolator was single-phase when it was in fact three-phase. Mr Tong connected the replacement motor to the isolator based on this incorrect assumption. The switch for the main electricity supply was turned on at that time.""
As the employer of the team, Lee failed to take several necessary measures. She did not properly conduct a risk assessment to identify the electrocution hazard and associated risks, nor to establish and implement safe work procedures to minimise and control the risks.
She had conducted a risk assessment, but it identified only the hazards of being struck by falling objects and falling from height. The assessment failed to identify the hazard of electrocution, even though the job involved working with live electrical apparatus.
As part of safety measures, Lee should have identified the hazard of electrocution and implement control measures.
This includes checking if the electricity supply was three-phase or single phase, wearing insulative protective equipment and maintaining a safe distance from energised parts.
Investigations revealed that Lee had failed to ensure that her team had adequate instruction, information and training that was necessary for them to finish the job.
Although she carried out toolbox meetings with her employees, she was unfamiliar with the works they performed and the safety precautions they must take.
None of the employees in the team had completed the required training course before erecting scaffolds and were untrained and unqualified, court documents stated.
Lee was allowed to pay the fine in instalments by February 2023.

Six more MRT stations will be built in Phase 2 of Cross Island Line; to open by 2032,"The stations are Turf City, King Albert Park, Maju, Clementi, West Coast and Jurong Lake District, forming Phase 2 of the Cross Island Line.  
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mrt-stations-cross-island-line-phase-2-west-coast-turf-city-jurong-lake-district-late-2950841,"SINGAPORE: Six more stations on the Cross Island Line (CRL) will be built and are slated to open in 2032, Transport Minister S Iswaran announced on Tuesday (Sep 20).
The stations are Turf City, King Albert Park, Maju, Clementi, West Coast and Jurong Lake District, forming Phase 2 of the Cross Island Line.  
Spanning 15km, the stations will improve connectivity for residents in the west, including areas such as Sunset Way and West Coast that are not currently served by an MRT line, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).
Two of the stations will be interchanges, with King Albert Park linking to the Downtown Line and Clementi to the East-West Line.

The Cross Island Line is Singapore's eighth MRT line and the longest fully underground line at more than 50km. It will be constructed in three phases.
Phase 1 of the line, which was announced in 2019, comprises 12 stations from Bright Hill in the Sing Ming area to Aviation Park in the east. It stretches through areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon North, Defu, Tampines North and Loyang. 
Phase 2 will shorten travel times for commuters in the west, particularly for those in West Coast.
For instance, a student travelling from Hougang to Ngee Ann Polytechnic on Clementi Road will take 35 minutes on the CRL, down from more than one hour of travel time currently, said LTA.
Giving another example, LTA said a commuter travelling from West Coast to Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park could save up to 40 minutes. The trip currently takes an hour and 10 minutes, and will be cut to 30 minutes on the CRL2.

Construction for CRL2 is expected to start next year and the stations are to open by 2032. It is expected to benefit 40,000 households living in those areas.
LTA said this will help it achieve its target of having eight in 10 homes within a 10-minute walk to a train station.
""By connecting key commuting corridors across Singapore, the Cross Island Line will also help to redistribute passenger movement across rail lines, thereby improving the overall public transport experience,"" said Mr Iswaran on a visit to the East Coast Integrated Depot, which is under construction and due to be completed in 2025.
""The wider and denser network will strengthen resilience at the system level.""











Mr Iswaran said that Singapore's rail network will expand at a scale ""unprecedented in our nation's history"", and commuters can expect a further 50 per cent expansion of the network from 245km now to 360km by the early 2030s.
The Cross Island Line will also serve as a ""key enabler"" for the economy and support hubs of economic activity outside the central business district, he said. These include the Jurong Lake District, Punggol Digital District and Changi region.
It will thus bring jobs closer to homes, the minister said. By improving connectivity, reliability and convenience, the MRT line can also make the switch from driving to public transport more attractive.
""We also want to encourage public transport as it is an environmentally sustainable commuting mode that can serve our urban mobility needs,"" Mr Iswaran said, adding that taking the MRT instead of driving an internal combustion engine car can reduce one's carbon footprint by almost 90 per cent.

LAND TO BE ACQUIRED
To facilitate the construction of CRL2, three part lots of private land will be acquired.
They include two industrial units owned by JTC that are currently leased to private entities at Pandan Loop Industrial Estate. Compensation will be based on the market value of the acquired land/subterranean.
A third plot is a stratum of subterranean space under part of a car park, taking up 18 parking lots, at Casa Esperanza Condominium on Bukit Timah Road.
The surface land above the subterranean space will be returned to the land owner on completion of CRL2 works, which could take about six years. Replacement car park spaces will be provided in the meantime.
LTA said that the Environmental Impact Study and Heritage Impact Assessment for CRL2 have been completed and the reports will be published on the websites of LTA and the Urban Redevelopment Authority in October for public feedback.
Engineering studies for Phase 3 of the CRL are ongoing and more details will be announced after the studies are complete. 
Since March, all the civil contracts for CRL Phase 1 have been awarded. Construction has started and is expected to be completed by 2030.
An extension connecting Pasir Ris to Punggol was announced in 2020 and is expected to be up and running in 2032.

Man gets jail for using forged State Courts payment slip to claim traffic fines were paid for his boss,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-gets-jail-using-forged-document-state-courts-logo-pay-traffic-fines-boss-chua-chee-siang-2950976,"SINGAPORE: A man claimed he had helped his boss pay his traffic fines in court, handing his boss a forged payment slip with the State Courts logo on it as proof.
In reality, he had gone to court for his own case and a warrant of arrest was later issued for his boss, who was a no-show.
Chua Chee Siang, 42, claimed trial to one count of using a forged document as genuine in a case the prosecution called ""ridiculous"". He was convicted last month and sentenced on Tuesday (Sep 20) to two months' jail.
According to court documents, Chua was working as an administrator for Mr Heng Cheng Hock, the director of A-TEC Motorz at the time of the offence.
In February 2019, Mr Heng was charged in the State Courts in his capacity as director of A-TEC Motorz for various traffic offences. He directed Chua to handle the matter and ensure that the fines for the charges were paid.
However, Chua did not settle the case with the Land Transport Authority (LTA). A warrant of arrest was issued for Mr Heng when he did not show up for his court case, and when Mr Heng learned of this, he demanded documentary proof from Chua that the case had been settled.
On May 10 2019, Chua handed Mr Heng a payment advice chit dated Apr 16, 2019. The document contained the logo of the State Courts and stated that a court fine of S$300 imposed by Court 25 had been paid.
BOSS WENT TO COURT WITH THE FAKE SLIP
Mr Heng went to court on May 28, 2019 and presented the document Chua had handed him. However, discrepancies were noted in the slip and investigations were mounted. The document was found to be forged.
At trial, Chua claimed that he had gone to court on Apr 16, 2019, to plead guilty on behalf of his boss and pay the fine of S$300 imposed by the court.
""Curiously, the accused has persistently maintained this claim, from the outset when his police statements were recorded, all the way till the end of trial,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Melina Chew.
This was despite the fact that it was not possible for Chua to plead guilty on behalf of his boss. Even though his boss was mistaken in directing Chua to attend court on his behalf, if Chua did go to court to represent Mr Heng, the court would have refused to accept the plea and asked Mr Heng to attend court himself.
Second, it is not possible for the court to sentence an offender when a warrant of arrest is active against them. A warrant of arrest was issued against Mr Heng on Mar 5, 2019 because he had not attended his case. This means there was no fine levied by the court for Mr Heng.
Mr Heng later paid a composition sum of S$250 for his charges and was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal by LTA.
The State Courts' internal finance management system showed that the payment reference number on the forged payment chit Chua obtained was for a case involving another man, where a fine of S$700 was imposed by Court 14.
At the time, the courts did not issue payment advice chits or any documentary proof of payment of fines for LTA cases. The courts did not have any arrangement with LTA to collect fine payments by offenders on LTA's behalf. 
""Further, a payment advice chit only serves to advise an offender on the fine amount which they are supposed to pay and does not serve as proof of payment of a fine,"" said the prosecutor.
She said that Chua did go to court on Apr 16, 2019, but it was for his own LTA case.
""For exact reasons that would remain only known to the accused, the accused decided to lie to (Mr) Heng and tell him that his LTA case had been settled, when in fact it was not and there was an active warrant to arrest for (Mr) Heng,"" said Ms Chew.
She quoted Chua's claim that ""the amount of S$300 ... to do such a thing is definitely ridiculous"".
""The evidence presented before this honourable court, however, leads to the inevitable conclusion that the accused did do the 'ridiculous',"" she said.
She said the nature of the forgery showed that the chit could not have been issued due to an oversight or administrative error and slammed the underlying suggestions that an officer of the State Courts would have engaged in forgery.
Ms Chew had asked for about three months' jail, noting Chua's lack of remorse as evident from his ""fanciful defence"".
He was allowed to defer his sentence to October.
For using a forged document as genuine, he could have been jailed for up to four years, fined, or both."
"'Small handful' of safe-distancing ambassadors left, almost all have returned to other sectors: MSE",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/small-handful-safe-distancing-ambassadors-left-covid-19-mse-2950676,"SINGAPORE: Only a ""small handful"" of safe-distancing ambassadors are left due to contractual arrangements, with almost all having returned to other sectors, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) on Tuesday (Sep 20).
Safe-distancing ambassadors were employed by the Government during the COVID-19 pandemic to guide and advise businesses and people to comply with safe management measures.
Since April this year, it has been stepping down the deployment of safe-distancing ambassadors and assisting them to seek alternative employment.
""Some private companies have also deployed their own personnel on their premises to perform similar roles to the Government’s safe-distancing ambassadors,"" said MSE in response to queries from CNA. 
CNA has contacted the ministry for more information about the remaining safe-distancing ambassadors.
MSE said that the Government will continue to deploy enforcement officers to conduct checks and investigations on violations of safe management measures.
""Only enforcement officers, who are public officers currently employed by government agencies, police officers and auxiliary police officers, have the authority to conduct enforcement against safe management measures violations,"" said MSE.

Woman with schizophrenia acquitted of murdering her 8-year-old daughter on grounds of unsound mind,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-schizophrenia-psychosis-acquitted-murder-daughter-court-2950611,"SINGAPORE: A woman suffering from untreated schizophrenia listened to voices telling her that her eight-year-old daughter was an evil spirit and needed to be killed.
She stabbed her daughter to death in front of her younger daughter, who was four at the time. The woman, who is now 36, cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity.
She pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Sep 20) to one count of murder, but was acquitted of the charge under Section 251 of the Criminal Procedure Code as she was of unsound mind at the time of the offence.
The judge ordered that she be kept in safe custody in prison and for the case to be reported to the minister. According to Section 252 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the minister may then order her to be confined in a psychiatric institution, prison or another suitable place of safe custody during the President's pleasure.
The court heard that the Singaporean woman entered into a relationship with a man in 2007, and they had two daughters. They did not get married.
Around 2014, the woman's boyfriend returned to China to continue working there, while the woman stayed in Singapore with her daughters.
Before travel restrictions were imposed in China and Singapore because of the COVID-19 pandemic, either the woman or her boyfriend would travel to visit each other. However, when the pandemic broke out, they would only video-call each other.
In 2020, the woman and her daughters moved to live with their family members in a unit in Geylang.
FAMILY NOTICED HER STRANGE BEHAVIOUR
Their family members noticed that the woman behaved strangely between 2018 and August 2020. For instance, she suspected her phone and laptop were hacked, and that people were following her.
She was often suspicious that others would harm her, and would throw away food and drinks that her family members prepared, preventing her children from consuming them as well.
She also monitored her family members' cooking to ensure no poison was added, the court heard. The woman stopped sleeping with the air-conditioning on, as she would fall asleep very deeply and fail to notice if someone wanted to harm her.
She said someone wanted to kill her and her daughters, and said she needed to protect them.
In the two days leading up to the murder, closed-circuit television cameras at train stations captured her behaving erratically.
Two days before the murder, she entered Aljunied MRT station alone and took the train to Somerset. She left the station for several minutes before returning, but tapped out again after going through the gantry.
She later took the train to Tanjong Pagar, exiting and entering again after a few minutes. According to court documents, she travelled in this way as she was instructed by a voice to do so.
A day before the murder, she took her younger daughter to Aljunied MRT station in the morning and tailgated a commuter to enter the station with the four-year-old girl in her arms.
She went to Tampines MRT station, where she tailgated another commuter to exit the station. She behaved erratically in the area near Tampines MRT station for several hours, wandering aimlessly before sitting on the floor in the foyer of Tampines Mall with her daughter for about half an hour.
According to court documents, she was instructed by a voice to look for her house in Tampines and the voice told her not to bring her older daughter along.
Because of what the voice said, the woman brought only her younger daughter with her. She left her older daughter near the train station and asked her to leave them. The eight-year-old girl then went to her grandparents' coffee shop nearby.
WOMAN'S NIECE HEARD HER TALKING INCOHERENTLY
On Aug 10, 2021, the woman was in her bedroom with her two daughters. Her brother, sister-in-law, niece and nephew were also at home, while her parents were working in their coffee shop.
Sometime before 11.38am, the woman's niece was eating breakfast in the living room when she heard the woman talking incoherently in Mandarin in her room, referring to names of Chinese historical figures.
The woman's niece went to her parents' room and told her mother what she had heard, but her mother said she did not hear anything. The niece then went back to the living room to continue her breakfast.
She later heard the woman's two children crying and decided to record the woman's rants, as she felt it would be useful if the woman were to seek medical help.
As the woman was speaking very loudly and incoherently, her brother went to her room to check on her. When he opened the door, he was shocked to see the victim lying motionless on the floor. There was a lot of blood, and the woman was naked and holding a pair of scissors.
The woman's brother shouted at her, and she walked towards him. He asked his family to call the police. He saw a blood-stained knife in the room, and he quickly took it and threw it towards the kitchen before closing the door.
He took pillows to protect himself before re-entering the woman's room. She was waving the pair of scissors, and he found her younger daughter hiding behind the door.
He grabbed the girl quickly and went to his bedroom to hide with his wife and children. His wife called the police, and he made a phone call to ask his parents to return home quickly as the woman had stabbed her daughter.
The police and paramedics arrived at about noon. Two officers entered the woman's room and saw her holding onto a pair of scissors, while her older daughter was lying motionless on the floor.
After assessing that the woman did not pose an immediate danger, the officers escorted her out of the bedroom.
The victim was motionless and had no pulse or breath. She was taken to hospital with multiple wounds on her body and neck, but died later that day despite resuscitation efforts. Her cause of death was determined to be stab wounds to her neck and torso.
The girl's mother was clothed and arrested.
WOMAN SUFFERED FROM UNTREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA
Investigations revealed that the woman was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the offence. It had gone untreated for several years and worsened in severity as time progressed. At the time of the murder, she was suffering her first psychotic episode.
She began hearing voices in March 2021. They started out soft and infrequent, but became louder and the content more distressing. The voices told her that her food, water and cooking were poisoned.
They also told her to harm herself and her family. Specifically, the voices told her to kill her older daughter, as she was an evil spirit that needed to be killed.
On the day of the incident, the woman was with her daughters in her room when the voices again told her that her daughter was an evil spirit that needed to be killed.
Acting on the instruction of the voices, the woman stabbed her daughter to death and stopped only when the voices told her to stop, the court heard.
After this, the voices told her to take off her clothes and the woman complied, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia. The voices also told her to kill herself. Subsequently, her brother came in.
Ms Teo said that the woman was of unsound mind at the time of the offence and was hardly aware of what was going on. She was suffering from hallucinations and was mentally incapacitated such that she did not know what she was doing was wrong.
The woman is at high risk of self-harm and requires long-term supervision and psychiatric care, the court heard.
A psychiatrist assessed the woman and said she was severely psychotic at the time of the offence and was incapable of knowing the nature of her acts. Her psychosis caused her thinking and judgment to be so distorted and out of touch with reality that she was unable to differentiate between right and wrong, both morally and legally.
The woman is currently fit to plead in court.
The prosecutor asked for a court order for the woman to be kept in safe custody and for the matter to be reported to the minister.
It is undisputed that she caused her daughter's death, but in the circumstances, the prosecution urged the court to acquit the woman of her murder charge on the basis of an unsound mind.
Defence lawyers Choo Si Sen and his daughter Choo Yean Lin agreed with the prosecution's submissions. 
""A young innocent life is lost. That cannot be undone,"" said Ms Choo. ""However, moving on, we pray that the (woman) could recover speedily so she can be reunited with her aged parents and her youngest daughter.""

Consumers of pre-packaged drinks may have to pay 10-20 cent deposit under proposed recycling scheme,"The deposit will be refunded to consumers who return the cans and bottles at designated points. 
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nea-beverage-container-deposit-recycling-scheme-refund-can-plastic-bottle-2943576,"SINGAPORE: Consumers of pre-packaged beverages may have to fork out 10 to 20 cents more as a deposit for their favourite drinks if a proposed scheme meant to encourage recycling and reduce waste is implemented. 
In its initial stages, it will likely involve only metal cans and plastic bottles, with a flat deposit amount applied to each container regardless of size. 
This means that if a deposit amount is 20 cents, a can of coke that originally costs S$1.20 in a convenience store will retail for around S$1.40. 
Consumers will, however, be able to get their 20 cents back upon returning the can to designated return points that have yet to be confirmed.
The proposed beverage container return scheme is currently in its consultation phase.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) on Tuesday (Sep 20) invited the public to give feedback on the scheme's parameters, such as the amount of deposit to be charged. 
After details are firmed up, the scheme will likely be rolled out by mid-2024, with a grace period for producers to ensure that pre-packaged beverages comply with the new packaging requirements.
The scheme will not apply to drinks prepared on the spot, such as bubble tea.

Singapore to ‘relook’ timeline of beverage container return scheme following feedback: Amy Khor













THE SCHEME'S RATIONALE
The scheme was first announced at the 2020 Committee of Supply debates. It aims to reduce packaging waste, which forms about a third of domestic waste. About 60 per cent of such waste is plastic. 
More than 1 billion pre-packaged beverages are supplied domestically every year. 
In 2020, around 660 million metal cans and 390 million plastic bottles were used and according to NEA's figures, only 4 per cent of plastic waste was recycled that year. 
The beverage container return scheme is a step towards the goal of reducing the amount of waste sent to Singapore's only landfill, hence extending its lifespan beyond 2035. 
The goal, under the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the Zero Waste Masterplan, is to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill per capita per day by 20 per cent by 2026, and 30 per cent by 2030, and to increase the national recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030.
The beverage container return scheme will also be the first phase of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) approach to manage packaging waste. The approach aims to make beverage producers - which includes manufacturers and importers - more responsible for the collection and end-of-life management of their products. 
Speaking to reporters about the scheme on Tuesday, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor stressed that the scheme was not a ""tax"" on pre-packaged drinks. 
Dr Khor was speaking outside a Sheng Siong outlet at Block 451 Bukit Batok West Avenue 6, one of the supermarkets expected to have a beverage container return point when the scheme is rolled out.
Asked to address concerns about a potential price hike in pre-packaged drinks, Dr Khor said: ""I would like to emphasise that this deposit really is not a tax on the beverage because consumers will be able to get a full refund of the deposit paid as long as they return the used container. So the idea really is to encourage them to return to get back the deposit, inculcate recycling habits."" 
She added that the government did not expect a ""significant increase"" in beverage prices from the scheme due to competition amongst importers and manufacturers. 
""(Consumers) can choose different beverages as well as buy from different retail channels, and price competition really will moderate any changes in beverage prices.""

FINDINGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, PAST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTS
Singapore's scheme takes reference from similar programmes under different names in around 50 other jurisdictions.
CNA observed one such programme in Sydney, called the Return and Earn scheme, through which consumers received a 10-cent refund for each container they dropped off at return points such as automated depots. 
Other countries such as Norway, Germany and Lithuania have generally seen return rates of more than 90 per cent. Their deposit amounts ranged from the Singapore equivalent of 10 cents to 40 cents. 
In addition to overseas precedents, Singapore sought feedback from those with vested interest in the industry, such as beverage producers, retailers, waste management companies, environmental groups and members of the public.  
Most participants in focus group discussions and a dialogue session agreed to include plastic bottles and metal cans due to the ease of recovery and large quantities used. These materials are also easier to collect and compact. 
Other recyclable materials, such as beverage cartons and glass bottles, may be considered at a later phase. 
To avoid confusion, all beverages - including alcohol and dairy products - that come in metal cans and plastic bottles will be eligible.
Based on past feedback, the deposit will likely be a flat amount of between 10 cents and 20 cents that will apply to all containers regardless of size. 
A higher deposit amount may discourage consumers from buying beverages, while a lower rate may fail to motivate consumers to recycle.

WHAT THE PROCESS MAY LOOK LIKE
The scheme will likely be managed by a not-for-profit entity that will take charge of operations, such as the collection of used containers, and the handling of deposits.
This operator will be required to report its operations and performance, and achieve a return target set by the NEA, which will regulate and monitor its compliance. 
In similar overseas initiatives, producers of pre-packaged beverages are legally responsible for the collection and recycling of used containers. They register as a member with the scheme operator to collect and recycle beverage containers on behalf of the operator and also fund the scheme. 
Barcodes of pre-packaged drinks must be registered with the operator. This helps the operator track the numbers and types of containers covered and also serves to prevent consumers from claiming a refund for inapplicable containers, such as those bought overseas. Barcodes can also be scanned when returned to reverse vending machines.
Apart from a barcode, containers will be labelled with a deposit mark to help consumers identify those that are covered under the scheme. 
As to where the containers can be returned, the Government is mulling mandated return points at large supermarkets with a total area of more than 200 sq m. These supermarkets - of which there are around 400 - are also the preferred return locations for survey respondents.
Other return points will be considered after balancing their convenience and accessibility to consumers against the operational costs of an extensive collection network. 
Return points could take the form of over-the-counter manual returns handled by cashiers, or automated reverse vending machines. The scheme operator will pay these return points handling fees to compensate for associated costs.
As to how food and beverage operators may carry out the scheme, Dr Khor said that operators may choose to pour the beverage into cups for customers and keep the containers, or they might hand the container over to customers themselves. 
Upon return of the containers, consumers may get their refunds through electronic transfer, cash, cash vouchers or may also opt to donate the amount to charity. 
Based on the past survey, cash and electronic transfers were the most preferred options. 
The public is invited to give their feedback and views, particularly on the type of beverage containers to include, the deposit amount and return point locations, via go.gov.sg/nea-bcrs. The survey will close on Oct 14, 11.59pm.
Editor's note: This story has been amended to remove the reference that supermarkets where the containers can be returned to account for one-third of prepackaged drinks sold in Singapore. We apologise for the error."
CNA Explains: When a lucrative job offer turns into a con - how do you avoid falling for such scams?,"Job scams were the most common type of scam in Singapore in the first half of 2022, with 3,573 cases reported and S$58.5 million lost.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/job-scam-police-singapore-overseas-job-offer-malaysia-cambodia-2948306,"SINGAPORE: That online advertisement promising a handsome salary for easy work overseas? If it is too good to be true, it probably is.
Sixteen Malaysians found out the hard way, duped by lucrative job offers on Facebook as customer service officers in Cambodia. The victims were whisked illegally into the country, stripped of their travel documents and forced to scam others without getting paid a single cent.
The victims, aged between 19 and 43, were rescued in April with the help of local and international authorities. One Malaysian who fell for this job scam told CNA that he was at the mercy of four syndicates for a month before being saved.
He worked late into the night, getting beaten and tasered if he could not scam at least one person each week. Those who wanted to be released had to pay RM50,000.
These human trafficking victims experienced a ""living hell"", one United Nations official said, often resulting in torture and even death. Victims come from places like China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam. Some remain trapped in countries like Cambodia and Myanmar.

‘I thought it would never happen to me’: How one victim lost S$300,000 in jobs scam













While the job scams in Singapore typically do not involve physical violence, they are hardly benign.
This type of scam was the most common in the first half of 2022, with 3,573 cases reported and S$58.5 million lost. It was also the most common scam in the whole of 2021, with 4,554 cases reported compared to just 132 cases in 2020.
In May, police warned about unsolicited spoofed messages offering job opportunities purportedly sent by Lazada. There have been at least 50 victims since May, with losses amounting to more than S$430,000.
Here is how you can guard against job scams:
What are some common types of job scams?
In most of these cases, victims came across online advertisements or received unsolicited Telegram or WhatsApp messages from unknown numbers, offering part-time jobs with high salaries that could be done from home.
One common variant requires the victim to make advance purchases to help e-commerce merchants and get a commission in the process. The scammers would ask victims to provide a screenshot of the item in their shopping cart, then instruct them to make payment for the item to a specific bank account.
Scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the item and the commission, but would later claim to have encountered issues with the refund and stop paying the victims.











In other variants, victims who contact the number provided in the job advertisement would be instructed to complete tasks online, such as liking social media posts, or reviewing hotels and restaurants on a website, for a commission. 
And in a Ponzi-like variant, victims would be asked to buy expensive memberships before taking part in lucrative job tasks. They would often do so until the soaring membership costs forced them to stop.
Many realised they had been scammed when they were told they could only get their money back after finishing all the tasks, police said.
Where are these scammers located?
In October last year, two job scam syndicates based in Johor and Kuala Lumpur were busted in a joint operation by the Singapore Police Force and the Royal Malaysia Police.
Authorities raided an apartment in Johor and another in Kuala Lumpur, and arrested 10 Malaysians aged between 21 and 32.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the group had targeted Singaporean and Malaysian victims and laundered their criminal proceeds in Malaysia. The syndicate is believed to have targeted more than 390 victims reported in Singapore and cheated them of S$5 million.
How to avoid getting duped?
The police have urged job seekers to be wary of online advertisements that promise the convenience of working from home and being paid a high salary for ""relatively simple"" job responsibilities. 
Legitimate businesses will not require job seekers to make upfront payments to secure job offers and earn commissions or utilise their own bank accounts to receive money on the businesses’ behalf, the police said.
""These acts are common ruses used by scammers to lure individuals into participating in their schemes or scams,"" it added.
If you receive an unsolicited job offer, always verify the authenticity of the offer with the hiring company through their official channels, according to scamalert.sg. You can check the information against the ""recruitment"" section on the corporate website or by emailing the HR department.
The anti-scam website also urged the public not to respond to dubious job offers or download unverified apps from unknown sources to apply for a job.
Why do some still fall for it?
Beyond initially getting paid for the work, victims are often added to a WhatsApp group with members who are purportedly doing the same job.
These people would chat about their daily lives, share screenshots of the attractive sums of money they got, and actively deny that the job was a scam. These create an air of legitimacy for the victim.
When approached individually about whether it was a scam, the people would go to extra lengths to convince otherwise, telling the victim that they were ""crazy"" and that nobody had doubted the legitimacy of the job before, a CNA investigation in January revealed.
The front company in the scam would also have a legitimate and professional-looking website, complete with details like a phone number.
Can you get your money back?
Like in every type of scam, time is of the essence when it comes to tracing and recovering money lost.
The money will typically be routed through multiple accounts to evade detection, and if it leaves Singapore, it will become even more challenging to get back.
The police can freeze bank accounts and have successfully recovered money that was transferred overseas. But this is not a guarantee, especially as some jurisdictions could require victims to go through complicated and expensive legal processes.
The police have also consistently reminded people to reject requests to use their personal bank accounts to receive and transfer money for others, or risk getting implicated in money laundering activities."

From Westminster to Windsor, Britain's Queen Elizabeth makes the journey to her final resting place
King Charles and other senior British royals were joined by world leaders and monarchs in bidding farewell to Queen Elizabeth II at her state funeral at Westminster Abbey on Monday (Sep 19).
This is Britain's first state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. 
 After the state funeral, the procession set off for Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner. There, the coffin was placed in a hearse to travel to Windsor, where the queen will be buried with her husband, Prince Philip.
Hundreds of thousands of people crammed into central London to witness the ceremony for Britain's longest-serving monarch.
Here's a breakdown of what is expected throughout the day, which has been declared a public holiday in the UK for the occasion.
Typhoon Nanmadol batters Japan with record rain, killing two
Typhoon Nanmadol, one of the biggest storms to hit Japan in years, has killed at least two people and disrupted transport and forced manufacturers to suspend operations.
Japan's 14th typhoon of the season made landfall near Kagoshima city late on Sunday before hitting the western island of Kyushu and moving onto the main island of Honshu on Monday morning.
Local media said one man was found dead inside his car, which was submerged to the rooftop in the middle of a field, while another man died after being caught in a landslide.
Intermittent bouts of heavy rain lashed Tokyo but businesses in the capital were largely operating as normal.
More layoffs at Shopee, three months after previous round of job cuts
E-commerce giant Shopee cut more jobs on Monday (Sep 19), citing ""ongoing efforts to optimise operating efficiency with the goal of achieving self-sufficiency across our business"".
The retrenchments were announced internally in the morning in town halls with staff.
Earlier this month, the e-commerce firm rescinded dozens of job offers, and in June, Shopee laid off some employees in its food delivery ShopeeFood and online payment ShopeePay teams in Southeast Asia, as well as staff in Mexico, Argentina and Chile. 
In a letter to employees of parent company Sea last week, CEO Forrest Li said that the company had made “some difficult announcements” lately, citing a turbulent period for the tech industry. 
Sea reported a net loss of US$931 million in the second quarter, more than double the loss it made in the same period a year earlier.
Woman who caused commotion with knife at Tampines St 82 arrested for possessing offensive weapon
A woman who caused a commotion with a knife outside St Hilda's Secondary School in Tampines on Monday (Sep 19) evening was arrested for possessing an offensive weapon.
Witnesses said they saw her swing and wave the blade, and get more agitated as police officers approached her.
Police said the woman stabbed herself in the abdomen and threatened to further harm herself.
An officer fired a Taser to prevent her from further injuring herself, police said.
The woman was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon and suspected drug offences, and also apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act.
She was taken to hospital conscious and in a stable condition.

" Police officer found with gunshot wound at Bayfront Avenue believed to have fired three shots, the third to his head: SPF","Based on preliminary investigations, the police do not suspect foul play.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-officer-dead-gunshot-bayfront-avenue-boardwalk-fired-three-shots-2949271,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) officer who was found with a gunshot wound at 1 Bayfront Avenue and later pronounced dead was believed to have fired three shots, said the police on Monday (Sep 19) evening.
“The officer had reported for duty in the morning of Sep 19, 2022, and had drawn his service pistol from the armoury,” said the police in a news release, adding that the officer later went to the boardwalk along 1 Bayfront Avenue, where Marina Bay Sands is located.
The police said they were alerted to three gunshots heard along the area at 9.44am.
“The officer was later found with a gunshot wound to his head. He was believed to have fired two shots into the air, before firing the third shot to the right side of his head,” said the police.
The 29-year-old officer was sent unconscious to the hospital, where he was subsequently pronounced dead.
No other person was reported to be injured, said the police, adding that the service pistol was found at the scene.
The case has been classified as unnatural death and investigations are ongoing. So far, the police do not suspect foul play.
The officer joined the police force in September 2014 and was with Central Police Division.
“Based also on preliminary checks, he had not sought help from his unit, supervisors, or counsellors,” the police said.
“SPF officers undergo training by the Police Psychological Services Department (PPSD) on how to identify possible signs and symptoms of distress and learn basic coping skills,” they said.
They added that officers are also informed of the resources they can access should they need assistance in coping with their distress, which include internal and external resources.
“For instance, each unit in the SPF has para-counsellors who are trained in basic counselling skills to help identify distressed officers and render necessary support,” said SPF.
Officers can also go for face-to-face counselling with in-house psychologists or external counselling service providers, they added.
“At the same time, best practices on safeguarding mental health and well-being and other relevant resources are shared regularly with officers via internal communications channels.”
The police also appealed to members of the public to refrain from circulating videos or images of the deceased out of respect for his family.
BERITAmediacorp was tipped off about the incident on Monday via WhatsApp, with two pictures sent to the news portal.
The first picture shows a man lying on the boardwalk in front of Marina Bay Sands with a gun near him. Another photo shows a police car near the location where the man was found.

Woman brandishing knife in Tampines stabs herself after police stand-off,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-knife-arrested-tampines-street-82-2949081,"SINGAPORE: A 53-year-old woman who was allegedly ""brandishing"" a knife outside St Hilda's Secondary School in Tampines on Monday (Sep 19) evening was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon, said the police.
Police told CNA that they had received a call for assistance at about 6.30pm regarding the woman who was near Block 840 Tampines Street 82, opposite St Hilda's Secondary School.
""When police officers arrived, the woman was uncooperative and refused to comply with police’s instructions,"" they said.
""The woman then stabbed herself in the abdomen and threatened to further harm herself. For her safety, one of the police officers then discharged a Taser to prevent the woman from further injuring herself."" 
Police said the woman was also apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act and for suspected drug-related offences. 











She was taken to the hospital conscious and in a stable condition. Investigations are ongoing.
When CNA arrived at the scene at around 7pm, the woman was seen screaming in pain. At least two police cars and about 10 police officers were there. At least four officers were seen carrying what appeared to be submachine guns.
An ambulance arrived shortly after and paramedics tried to calm the woman down. The woman wore a green shirt, which was stained with what appeared to be blood around the torso region.
Eyewitness Fuad Mohammad said he was on his way out with his father in a car when he saw police vehicles and about six policemen trying to take control of the situation. 
He said he saw the woman swinging and waving around what ""looked like a knife"". 











He told CNA that the woman started panicking when more policemen approached her. He added that she was alone at the scene.

In a video sent by Fuad, a woman in a green shirt carrying a bag can be seen waving her hands and speaking to police officers.
At least 20 people had gathered across the road, watching the scene unfold. 
One person, who did not want to be named, told CNA that he saw a woman holding a knife and pointing towards the officers. He said he heard officers telling the woman to put the knife down. 
""I think maybe it was a commotion (for about) 15 minutes. And then she dropped her penknife down and that’s when one of the policemen pinned her against the fence as you can see over there and then they managed to pin her down,"" the onlooker said, who added that the woman said she wanted to call her husband. 
Another witness, Karina Vennard, 30, told CNA that the road had been blocked off and she had to alight from the taxi she was in and walk. In her account, she said the object in the woman's hand appeared to be a pair of scissors.
""When I walked past, I saw her standing there with scissors. She was on the phone. She was shouting at (the police) and they were telling her to drop her weapon.
""And then she dropped her scissors accidentally and she reached over to pick it up. And then that’s when the cops kinda panicked and jumped (on) her and handcuffed her.""
Shortly after at 7.40pm, the woman was put on a stretcher and taken into an ambulance.

"Son gave me life, says mum who received Singapore’s first liver transplant in a stage four cancer patient","Liver transplants, previously not recommended for stage four patients with cancer in the liver, will today increase chances of surviving by at least another five years to 60 per cent, studies show.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-first-liver-transplant-colorectal-cancer-stage-4-2948996,"SINGAPORE: It started with a stomach ache and diarrhoea for Madam Lim Gek Meng. Before long, a colonoscopy showed she had stage four colorectal cancer, which had spread extensively to her liver.
“It’s the fourth stage… so that means I will die soon. I was very frightened. Then, I asked the doctors how long I had,” said Mdm Lim, 61, recounting her consultation with doctors in 2020 when she was told of her terminal condition.
Two years later, Mdm Lim is cancer-free, after her son donated part of his liver to her in the first such transplantation for a patient with extensive cancer spread in Singapore.
In July, Mdm Lim received a liver transplant from her son, Mr Goh Jun Le. A multidisciplinary team including pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, hepatologists and oncologists from the National University Health System (NUHS) was involved.
The liver transplant was her only hope after doctors found that they could not surgically remove cancer cells from her liver, as that would risk losing too much of the vital organ.
Conventionally, patients like Mdm Lim undergo chemotherapy to control and prevent the spread of the disease and would have no further treatment options.
BREAKTHROUGH FOR OTHER PATIENTS
Liver transplants were previously not recommended for stage four cancer patients as suppressed immune systems due to the procedure may increase the risk of a cancer relapse. However, studies in the past two decades have shown that transplant is possible with careful patient selection.
To make such a transplant happen, NUHS, along with international experts, formulated patient management guidelines with 44 criteria to help define specific patient profiles suitable for the procedure, as well as tests for treatment in the course of the transplant, and aftercare.
Eligible patients include, for instance, colon cancer patients whose disease has spread only to the liver that is not operable upfront and is responding well to chemotherapy, said Associate Professor Glenn Bonney, consultant at the division of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the National University Hospital (NUH).
He added that the cut-off age for transplants is generally at 70.
It took more than 50 medical professionals to assess Mdm Lim's condition, carry out treatment procedures, and provide follow-up care.
Liver transplantation increases one's chances of surviving by at least another five years, from lower than 20 per cent to more than 60 per cent, and the breakthrough has paved the way for other suitable candidates to undergo the procedure.
Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in men and second most common cancer in women in Singapore. More than 50 per cent of patients develop metastases - the spread of cancer cells - to the liver, according to the National University Cancer Institute Singapore (NCIS).
""The colon gets all the nutrition and food goes through the colon, and there's a very important blood vessel that takes that digested food through blood into the liver,” Assoc Prof Bonney said.
“When colon cancer appears in the colon, the cells are capable of going through that blood vessel to the liver and therefore, by far and away, the most common way for colon cancer to spread, is to the liver.”
Assoc Prof Bonney said that he felt privileged to be part of Mdm Lim’s recovery process and to be part of the team leading Singapore’s – and the region’s – first liver transplant in a stage four cancer patient.
“I feel really privileged to be able to work in a system that can generate that kind of care, to finally reach a stage where after that two years… to have transplanted our patient, to be standing there with the whole team in intensive care, when she was fully awake after transplant to tell her: ‘Mdm Lim, today you don’t have cancer’,” he said.
TAKING CARE OF MDM LIM
Assoc Prof Bonney said that Mdm Lim’s aftercare consists of two priorities – first to ensure that there are no episodes of rejection for her liver, and second to ensure there is no relapse due to a weakened immune system.
“I have to do a follow up every week, but I feel very fortunate that I can even do a follow up every week,” said Mdm Lim in Mandarin. “I want to live. I want to defeat cancer. The most important thing is I’m alive.”
Her son Mr Goh said that when the opportunity came – his liver was a match and could be transplanted in Mdm Lim – he thought: “Let me go for it. Because she is my mother and I want to help her.”
“When I came out of the surgery room, when I woke up, I was relieved to find out that the surgery went well and afterwards, over the weeks, that her liver -- my liver that was transplanted into her – is still working well,” Mr Goh said.
He was relieved and happy, he added.
“He’s very brave,” Mdm Lim said of her son. “When he said yes to donating his liver to me, I was very heartened. I gave him life, and now he's given me mine.”

Males wanted: Pre-schools look to tap more diverse pool as sector expands,"The Early Childhood Development Agency has embarked on a national campaign to correct misperceptions that the industry is more suited for women.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/preschool-ecda-males-manpower-2948891,"SINGAPORE: Mr Koh Yi Rong was a dance instructor for five years, but in the process, he found his real passion: Teaching young children.
Mr Koh went through a career conversion programme and has been in the pre-school sector for the past nine months. His interest in the job was ignited when he got to conduct enrichment dance classes for pre-schoolers, he said.
“I find that it's really a very impactful job, where we get to teach the young children, get to see them grow, and help the next generation. So it's something that is very meaningful,” he told CNA.
His decision was not without reservation.
“I did have a lot of concerns like: Will there be many pre-school centres willing to take in male teachers? Will I be able to find a suitable pre-school that is willing to accept me, especially since I'm going through a mid-career switch?” he said. 
He was also afraid that he would not be able to adapt and that parents may not trust male teachers, he said. 
He, however, got a job at My First Skool through the programme offered by Workforce Singapore and is currently a trainee teacher. 
SMALL PROPORTION OF MEN IN EARLY CHILDHOOD SECTOR
The number of male teachers like Mr Koh is rising, but overall, they make up fewer than one per cent of pre-school educators in Singapore, said Ms Cynthia Leow, director of policy and sector funding at the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). 
There were 185 male pre-school educators last year, a 63 per cent increase compared to 114 six years ago. But with plans to establish 10,000 more full-day centres by 2023, pre-schools will need to tap both male and female talent pools.
“Male educators can play a valuable role as they bring different strengths and perspectives to our preschools,” Ms Leow said.
“Male educators can also serve as role models for our children and demonstrate the meaningful role men can play in supporting children’s development in their early years.”

Ms Leow added that as the early childhood sector continues to expand, there will be more opportunities for leadership as well as growing areas of specialisation such as the teaching of Mother Tongue languages, outdoor learning and socio-emotional development.
However, Ms Leow said there are societal misperceptions that the early childhood sector is associated only with caregiving and is more suited for women. 
Lead curriculum specialist at Odyssey Global Preschools, Mr Liang Jian has personally experienced this.
""Parents felt a little concerned by the presence of male teachers. They'll occasionally ask my colleagues: How is this teacher? Is he particularly fierce to the kids?"" he told CNA.
To correct such misperceptions, ECDA has embarked on a national campaign to create greater awareness of the sector and career opportunities, as well as to foster greater respect and recognition of a career in the industry, Ms Leow said.
PRE-SCHOOLS LOOK FORWARD TO HIRING MORE MALES
Odyssey is looking forward to hiring more men, said assistant centre director Ethel Chia. 
Although there are constraints to hiring males - they are not allowed to perform routine care for younger children - that has not stopped Odyssey from actively hiring males, she said. New roles have been created for them.
“We've learned to work around it. We have other positions for male teachers to just come on board,” she said, giving the examples of fitness specialist, art specialist and music specialist roles.
My First Skool, which currently employs 16 male teachers across 15 centres, is hoping to attract more men to the sector.
“Over the past few years, we have been very, very open to attracting more (males) to join us, so typically year-on-year we are able to see two to three new (male) colleagues joining us on the team,” said the pre-school chain’s general manager Thian Ai Ling.
“Our male counterparts - they are actually a very invaluable, untapped source of manpower for preschools.”
She added that in a predominantly female sector, it is good to have a different perspective.
ECDA is also looking for more support from parents.
“As we encourage more men to consider taking up a career in the early childhood sector, we hope that all parents will recognise the role male educators can play in their children’s development, and support pre-schools’ efforts to draw more men into the sector,” Ms Leow said."
Views wanted on how Singapore can promote sustainable living and address climate change: MSE,"Public engagements for environmental sustainability under Forward Singapore’s Steward Pillar were launched on Monday as Climate Action Week 2022 kicked off.

As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, public engagements for environmental sustainability were launched on Monday (Sep 19) by the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin and Senior Minister of State for Finance and Transport Chee Hong Tat at the Partners for the Environment Forum held during Climate Action Week 2022.
""The Government will seek to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints as well as opportunities that Singapore faces as we tackle climate change, the trade-offs that Singapore has to balance, our priorities moving forward, and how we can all contribute to realise our vision for the future,"" MSE said in a press release on Monday.
In her opening address at the Partners for the Environment Forum, Ms Fu noted that the government, industry, and community have important roles to play.
She said: ""As consumers, we can exercise our purchasing power to encourage businesses to produce greener goods and services. As residents, we can be gracious and considerate to our neighbours by keeping our communal spaces clean and healthy.
""As community members and leaders, we can act for change by starting ground-up projects and rallying others to pitch in for the environment.
""As stewards, we can lead sustainable lifestyles, and encourage our family and friends to adopt environmentally friendly habits, like reducing waste."" 
The Partners for the Environment Forum is an annual forum held by MSE to discuss key environmental issues with partners from three sectors - people, private and public.
Members of the public may submit their views via this link. 
Respondents will be asked a series of questions, including how important it is to ensure Singapore's food supply and achieve net-zero emission. 
They can also share their views on how the public can contribute to saving the environment and sustainable practices that community groups, corporations and businesses can incorporate. 
The MSE also called for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to make pledges to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore via the Forward SG website. 
This year's Climate Action Week starts today, and ends on Sunday. It features about 140 initiatives organised by more than 80 partners. 
Members of the public will be able to participate in activities such as learning journeys and guided tours, green challenges, workshops, dialogues and seminars, said MSE.

LTA told CNA that the ""interim"" measure will give commuters waiting at the bus stops a clearer view of the bus service number.
LTA's response came after a commuter took to social media to complain that his view of oncoming buses was blocked by the bus stop columns.
LTA said it was aware of the feedback on the two bus stops near Punggol MRT Station.
It explained that the widths of the two bus stops are ""slightly narrower"" than a typical bus stop, because they were converted from passenger pick-up and drop off points.
""The bus stop columns are located at the front due to the existing drain that runs behind the bus stops,"" said LTA. ""Given the site constraints, moving the columns behind the bus stop would require the entire structure, including the drainage system, to be re-constructed.""
LTA said it will be exploring improvements to the design of the bus stops through regular reviews of public transport infrastructure.
""Improvements will be made to these bus stops where feasible."""

Singapore's Sea cuts some Garena unit jobs, shuts projects, sources say



















Tech workers left hanging as Sea e-commerce arm Shopee rescinds job offers 













Earlier this month, Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce firm rescinded dozens of job offers. At the time, parent company Sea said it had recently cancelled some offers at Shopee “due to adjustments to hiring plans” on some tech teams, but declined to say how many offers were rescinded.
In June, Shopee laid off some employees in its food delivery ShopeeFood and online payment ShopeePay teams in Southeast Asia, as well as staff in Mexico, Argentina and Chile. 
In a letter to Sea employees last week, CEO Forrest Li said that the company had made “some difficult announcements” lately, citing a turbulent period for the tech industry. 
“Sadly, we are not immune to these shocks,” he wrote. 
The “number one objective” for the next 12 to 18 months is achieving self-sufficiency, which means achieving “positive cashflow” as soon as possible, said Li in his letter. 
Sea reported a net loss of US$931 million in the second quarter, more than double the loss it made in the same period a year earlier.
In comments provided to CNA, executive director of Digital Industry Singapore Chan Ih Ming noted that given the economic slowdown, companies have to decide “how best to position themselves for the future”, and this might involve adjusting their workforce strength and profiles. 
“The rapid growth of the tech sector in recent years has led to intense competition for tech talent globally, resulting in wage escalation and poaching even beyond the tech sector,” he added. 
Tech jobs continue to be in high demand, increasing by about 10,000 annually across Singapore’s economy last year, especially for machine learning engineers and backend developers, he said. 
“This is largely a result of accelerated digitalisation efforts across companies emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mr Chan. 
“We remain confident in the growth potential of Singapore’s tech sector as global tech companies continue to invest in Singapore, and many local tech companies expand to pursue growth in the region.”"

'You have blood on your hands': Ex-teacher admits harassing school principal following student's death,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/you-have-blood-your-hands-ex-teacher-admits-harassing-principal-school-fatal-incident-student-died-lee-lit-meing-2948721,"SINGAPORE: A former teacher sent distressing anonymous letters to a school following the death of a student, calling the principal a murderer over a phone call and telling him: ""You have blood on your hands.""
The offender also harassed a lecturer at an institution that was not named in court documents, by sending her anonymous text messages telling her that she ""can't even teach to save (her) life"".
Lee Lit Meing, who is now a private tutor, pleaded guilty on Monday (Sep 19) to one count of sending WhatsApp messages containing abusive words with intent to cause distress, and another charge of using abusive words in an anonymous phone call to cause distress.
The names of the institutions involved cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the victims' identities.
The court heard that Lee, now 46, worked at a school under the first victim, who was the principal of the school. Lee was unhappy with the principal's management style and felt he was a difficult boss to work with.
After Lee left the school in 2017, he began sending the principal anonymous WhatsApp messages, letters and emails to harass him. He would use significant events involving the school to harass him and did so on at least three occasions between 2018 and 2020. 
Lee came across news reports of a fatal incident involving a student from a school and became unhappy, blaming the principal for the fatal incident.
He prepared 20 similar anonymous letters with the words: ""Heavy is the head which weareth the crown, eyes tained with guilt. Tongue defiled by lies. Bloody are thy hands which are stained with a child's blood.""
Lee placed the letters in official envelopes belonging to the National University of Singapore, that he had found at a void deck of a block of flats sometime before 2018.
He used the envelopes to make the offences more difficult to be traced back to him, and sent 19 letters to staff at four schools and one letter to a church elder.
HE CALLED THE PRINCIPAL TO HARASS HIM
Lee decided to cause further distress to the principal and travelled from his home in Boon Keng to Sengkang, where he found an unattended public phone. He used the phone to call the principal on his personal mobile phone, and said: ""You have blood on your hands.""
He also said: ""You are a murderer. You killed a child. You are lucky that (redacted) forgave you.""
The principal felt stunned and explained to the caller, whose voice he did not recognise, that the fatal incident was under police investigation and it was inappropriate for him to comment.
The principal hung up and felt shocked. He told a colleague about the call, and the colleague told him that the school had received 10 anonymous letters that day.
The principal read one of the letters and found it to be like an epitaph from a tombstone, the court heard. He was told that the first line of the note was a quote from Shakespeare's Henry IV, and that the subsequent lines cast the blame for the death of the student on him.
The last line was a death threat, giving the impression that the principal was born in the 1970s and would die that very year. As a result, the principal felt ""devastated, scared and threatened"", the prosecutor said.
The principal was already feeling distressed about the fatal incident and felt scared that someone who knew his personal phone number and birth year was threatening him. He lodged a police report.
The anonymous call and letter caused significant alarm to the school's management, said the prosecutor, and the police conducted a briefing on how the management should deal with it.
As a result of Lee's actions, the principal became more cautious whenever he received calls or messages from unknown numbers, and worried for the safety of his family. He made sure that someone would accompany his children to and from school.
HE ALSO HARASSED FEMALE LECTURER
Lee also sent harassing text messages to a female lecturer at an institution, which was not named in court documents.
He was her student when he was a trainee teacher and disliked her as he felt she was ""quite high-handed"" and ""unkind"" to trainees. He decided to send anonymous messages to cause distress to her and let her know to be more supportive to trainees around April 2020.
On Apr 2, 2020, Lee sent WhatsApp messages to the woman's phone number. He said: ""Your ... stint is testament that those who can't do, teach. But, come to think of it. You can't even teach to save your life.""
He also wrote: ""After knowing you, I am now enlightened why some women are destined to stay single for life. Just saying.""
The woman felt scared when she received the messages. She did not recognise the number they were sent from, and the sender knew intimate details about her personal life, including her marital status, previous job posting and her mobile number.
She was worried about what the sender would do with such information, and fretted about the safety of her loved ones, her colleagues and herself. She lodged a police report the next day.
According to court documents, Lee has been a private tutor since 2019.
The prosecutor called for three weeks' jail, noting that harassment cases committed via anonymous communication would ordinarily warrant jail terms as such communications produce greater uneasiness in victims than when the author is known.
Lee will return to court for sentencing next month."
"Gojek to shorten grace period for cancellations, introduce minimum S$3 waiting fee from Sep 26","Gojek passengers can be charged up to S$9 in waiting fees.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gojek-grace-period-cancellations-4-minutes-waiting-fee-grab-2948686,"SINGAPORE: Gojek will shorten the grace period for cancellations to four minutes and introduce a waiting fee structure from Sep 26, following a similar move by Grab in July.
Currently, Gojek users are charged S$4 if they cancel five minutes after they have been matched with a driver, or if they cancel as soon as the driver arrives at their pickup location. 
From Sep 26, the grace period for cancellations will be reduced to four minutes. 
A first waiting fee of S$3 will be charged if a driver has waited at the pick-up point for more than four minutes. 
Passengers will be charged another S$3 for every five additional minutes the driver has to wait thereafter. This will be capped at S$9 - that is, after 19 minutes of waiting.
Announcing this on Monday (Sep 19), Gojek said the fees will help to ensure a smooth experience for all users on its platform, including drivers.
""This way, they’re compensated for their time and effort too,"" it added.
""To avoid any waiting fees, make sure to book only when you’re ready to get going, and be at the pick-up location within four minutes from when your driver has arrived.""

The fees apply for all trips on the Gojek platform - GoCar, GoCar XL and GoCar Premium. They cannot be offset or paid for with vouchers.
Gojek said passengers can request a review if they were wrongly charged a cancellation or waiting fee.
As for drivers, they can cancel without penalty only after four minutes of waiting at the pick-up point. ""The app will immediately help you find a new driver if your ride is cancelled,"" said Gojek.
OTHER RIDE-HAILING SERVICES
Grab announced in July that the grace waiting time and cancellation period for rides booked on its platform will be shortened from five to three minutes starting from Jul 18.
A S$4 fee applies if a passenger cancels a booking more than three minutes after accepting one.
Users will be automatically charged a waiting fee of S$3 per five-minute waiting block if they keep the driver waiting for longer than three minutes. 
According to the company’s website, the waiting fee policy has been in place since December 2016 to ensure that drivers are “properly compensated for the additional time spent waiting for passengers that have exceeded their grace waiting period”.
“You are encouraged to book rides only when ready to ensure you have ample time to reach your pickup point,” Grab said in an email to customers at the time.
Ryde charges a S$5.30 cancellation fee if a passenger cancels four minutes after booking a ride.
Ryde drivers may also charge a waiting time fee of S$5.30 if the user is not at the pickup point four minutes after the driver presses “I’m Here” on the app, regardless of whether the trip is completed.

"Man fined S$2,000 for scratching car that was parked in his favourite lot at NUS",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-fined-court-crime-scratch-car-parked-favourite-lot-nus-2948591,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$2,000 by a court on Monday (Sep 19) for using a key to scratch a car that was parked in his favourite lot at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Pang Kok Wai, 48, pleaded guilty to one count of mischief, with a second similar charge taken into consideration. 
The court heard that Pang was working as a crane operator at the time.
On the morning of Mar 9 this year, he drove to Car Park 10 at NUS in Lower Kent Ridge Road. He worked in the area and frequently parked there, but found that the car park was full.
Feeling frustrated, he drove off and parked further away. He returned to the car park on foot minutes later and saw another car parked in lot 234, which was his favourite lot.
Pang took out his house key and used it to scratch the car, before walking to his workplace.
The victim returned to his vehicle later that day after attending a course at NUS and discovered a long scratch from the front door to his rear door.
He sent his car for repairs and paid S$428 for the damages. The victim lodged a police report, and Pang was identified as the culprit. He paid the victim for the repairs in full.
Investigations revealed that he had also scratched another car that was parked in the same lot several days earlier on Mar 1, 2022.
The prosecutor sought a fine of at least S$2,000 to S$3,000, noting that Pang had no previous convictions. 
He said ""there was no excuse"" for Pang's actions, which were ""totally unwarranted"". 
In mitigation, Pang, who was unreprsented, admitted his mistake and said he felt sorry to the owner for causing the damage.
""I am sorry for my actions. I want to apologise to the owner for scratching his car,"" he said.
""I wish to state I was in deep stress and unable to control my anger due to my father's hospitalisation and hospital bill. I had some work-related issues with my boss that caused me to be stressed out. I promise not to commit the act again.""
He sought leniency, saying he felt uncomfortable with what he did and that he was put in a ""very stressful situation"" and keeps ""thinking about what will happen to me"".
""I used to have season parking at the car park but was often unable to find a parking lot,"" he added. ""I was also under a lot of stress and I (feel) very ashamed of what I have done.""
The judge noted that Pang's actions were unwarranted, and that he committed two offences in the span of about a week. However, she took into account his remorse, the restitution made and his early plea of guilt.
For mischief, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both."

"Man admits pawning fake Rolex Submariner watches for S$18,000 each",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-aw-poh-seng-admits-pawning-fake-counterfeit-rolex-submariner-watch-court-crime-debts-2948406,"SINGAPORE: In a bid to settle his gambling and loan shark debts, a man bought counterfeit Rolex watches and pawned them for more than 20 times the price he paid for them.
After successfully pledging a fake Rolex Submariner timepiece to a pawn shop for S$18,000, the man returned to the shop to pawn another watch and got a friend to pawn a third watch before being caught.
Aw Poh Seng, 33, pleaded guilty on Monday (Sep 19) to two counts of cheating and a third unrelated charge of carrying a stun gun at a fitness corner in Yishun. Three other charges will be considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Aw had racked up debts in July 2021 due to loans he took from unlicensed moneylenders as well as gambling debts.
He planned to deceive pawn shops by buying fake Rolex watches and pledging them at the shops in exchange for money. He looked for suppliers for counterfeit watches that bore very close similarities to the real deal and managed to find one.
He bought two counterfeit Rolex watches for S$800 and S$850. On Jul 15, 2021, Aw went to a pawn shop in Marsiling to pledge one of the timepieces. He presented the fake Rolex Submariner to an employee at the shop and claimed it was authentic.
The employee asked for a certificate of authenticity, but Aw claimed he had lost it. The employee was deceived and accepted the watch, giving Aw S$18,000 in return.
Aw also pawned a fake Rolex Deep Sea Dweller watch for S$16,500 at the same shop that day.
After receiving a total of S$34,500 for the two fakes, Aw grew emboldened and decided to cheat the shop again the next day, said the prosecutor.
However, he feared the shop would grow suspicious if he brought a third watch, so he asked a friend to help him. His friend agreed and took another fake Rolex Submariner to the same shop on Jul 16, 2021, where he pledged it for S$18,000.
Aw went to a gold shop to buy gold with the cash thereafter. The pawn shop caught wind of the scam and a police report was filed days later. Aw's friend was also nabbed. He pleaded guilty to his involvement and was sentenced in February this year.
When Aw was arrested, a gold amulet and a gold chain were seized from him, along with S$4,300 in cash. The pawn shop was willing to accept the gold and cash worth about S$31,700 in total as restitution.
No restitution was made for the remainder of the loss suffered of about S$20,000.
The court heard that Aw had convictions dating back to 2002, when he was convicted of theft as a young man and placed on probation. He breached his probation and was later convicted of other crimes including robbery with hurt and rioting, receiving jail terms and caning for different offences.
The prosecutor sought a total of 10 months' jail and a fine of S$3,000, saying that Aw's offences were clearly premeditated and planned. Aw also roped in an accomplice, said the prosecutor.
The defence asked for a slightly lower jail term, saying that his client was remorseful and has a family with three young children.
The judge adjourned sentencing to next month."

Applicants should also factor in additional waiting time to book an appointment to collect their passport, it added.
""ICA continues to urge Singaporeans with year-end travel plans to submit their passport application now if they are holding an expired passport or a passport with less than six months validity.""
Singaporeans who submit their passport late will risk not being able to collect their passport in time for their travel.
ICA said that it had recruited officers and redeployed resources to handle the surge in passport applications, adding that it is working closely with Singapore Post (SingPost) to increase the passport issuance capacity.
""The combined efforts have greatly improved the passport situation,"" said ICA.

ICA had in August also urged Singaporeans with year-end travel plans to submit their passport applications to ""avoid another surge for application of passports towards end of the year"" and to provide sufficient time for ICA to meet the demand for year-end travels.
ICA said in April this year that due to overwhelming passport applications, there would be a longer processing time of at least one month.
This was increased to six weeks in May, with ICA citing an ""overwhelming"" number of applications for the delay. 
Applicants can check on their passport application status via ICA’s website or MyICA Mobile.
Those whose passports are ready for collection will receive an email or a pink notification card from ICA.
""They may then proceed to make an appointment online to collect their passport from ICA Building or any of the 29 designated post offices,"" said ICA.
There is no additional fee for passport collection at the post offices, said ICA, adding that Singaporeans are strongly encouraged to make an appointment for timely collection of their new passports."
"Groomsman gets jail, caning for sexually assaulting the bride on wedding night",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/groomsman-gets-jail-caning-sexually-assaulting-bride-wedding-night-2948116,"SINGAPORE: A groomsman who molested and sexually assaulted the bride in a hotel suite on the wedding night was on Monday (Sep 19) sentenced to seven years' jail and six strokes of the cane.
The 42-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order preventing the publication of anything that could identify the victim or the accused, was convicted in May of one count each of sexual assault and molestation.
The couple, who dated for 11 years, has since divorced. They had married on an undisclosed date in 2016 and held a wedding banquet.
The offender was one of the groomsmen, who were invited back to the bridal suite after the banquet for an after-party.
The couple and their wedding party continued to drink alcohol in the suite, but the bride felt tired at about 1am and went to the bedroom to shower and change.
She recalled closing the sliding door that separated the bedroom from the living room but did not lock it. 
At about 3am, everyone left the room except the offender, who had fallen asleep on a sofa in the living room. The groom was asleep on another sofa in the same room.
The bride was woken at about 6am by someone touching her and sexually assaulting her. She thought it was her husband and asked him to take a shower, but there was no response. 
When the touching continued, the bride turned to look at the person but could not see him properly as the room was very dark. However, she saw that the person's face was much bigger and rounder than her husband's and knew that it was not him.
She asked him ""who are you?"" but he did not respond. Feeling scared, she left the bed and looked for her husband, who was asleep in his wedding suit on the sofa outside. She later saw that the person touching her was the offender, and lodged a police report with her then-husband.
The offender denied the charges, claiming that he thought he was asleep at home and was touching his wife.
However, the judge found that the offender's wife did not usually allow him to sleep in bed with him if he returned home after drinking and did not take a shower. 
In sentencing, District Judge Victor Yeo noted that there was ""a certain level of deception"" in the molestation charge as the victim was under the impression that the offender was her husband.
The man intends to appeal."
MOM launches workplace safety code of practice for company management,"The code of practice spells out the duties of company CEOs and directors on workplace safety and health.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-safety-health-wsh-code-practice-director-ceo-mom-2948031,"SINGAPORE: Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Monday (Sep 19) launched a code of practice that spells out the duties of company CEOs and directors on workplace safety and health, as well as reinforces their accountability for accidents at work.
This will be gazetted by October. When there is an offence under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, the courts can consider compliance with the code of practice in their judgment.
While the WSH Act already holds company directors liable for ensuring workers’ safety and health, the code outlines the ""desired outcomes"" in organisational systems and culture that they should seek to achieve, and lists examples of steps they can take.
Speaking at the opening of the 2022 WSH Conference, Dr Tan said that Singapore's workplace safety and health (WSH) performance got off to a ""rocky start"" this year.
There have been 37 workplace fatalities so far in 2022, the same figure for the whole of 2021.
Most of these accidents were due to preventable safety lapses, such as inadequate control measures or the lack of adherence to safety procedures, said Dr Tan.
""For a strong WSH culture to germinate, to grow and flourish, it must start from the top – with the chief executive and company directors,"" the minister said.
""This is because they are the ones with influence and control over budgets, priorities and training for WSH.
""WSH considerations have to be entrenched as most the important and non-negotiable decisions.""

IN FOCUS: Danger zones - how workplace safety lapses are costing lives













There are four main principles in the Code of Practice on Chief Executives and Board of Directors' WSH Duties.
The first is to ensure that WSH is integrated into business decisions and there is clarity in the roles and responsibilities of CEOs and directors in leading workplace safety and health measures.
Secondly, company management should ""continuously build a strong WSH culture, set the tone and demonstrate visible leadership in embodying and communicating highly effective WSH standards"", Dr Tan said.
They should also ensure that WSH management systems are effective and reviewed regularly, as well as empower workers to be actively engaged in WSH.
""The COP aims to distil the management principles and practices of safe companies into actionable steps for others to adopt and adapt to their circumstances,"" Dr Tan said.
He noted that it was drafted after ""extensive consultations"" with the Singapore Institute of Directors, Singapore Institute of Safety Officers, Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, Tripartite Partners and various industry associations.
The code was first announced in April and the ministry has been consulting industry stakeholders on it since then.
It will apply to companies in all industries, even those that have no manual work and little risk of physical injury. It also covers the mental well-being of workers.
""We will be gazetting the COP as an Approved COP by October this year,"" said Dr Tan.
""This means that in the event of a WSH Act offence, the courts can consider compliance to this approved COP in their judgment. Adhering to the approved COP’s principles can be a mitigating factor.""
Dr Tan added that small- and medium-sized enterprises starting out on implementing WSH can apply to the Ministry of Manpower's StartSAFE programme, and the ministry will bear the full cost of WSH consultancy visits to identify risks and advise on safety measures.
Urging companies to strengthen their WSH culture, he said: ""We recognise that it has been a turbulent period as we continue to battle work pressures and uncertainties.
""But we cannot and we can never let it be an excuse to put WSH on the back burner. It is paramount that companies understand the need to be safe, and how WSH is aligned to their commercial and economic interests.""

"The Big Read: Fans, businesses primed and eager for F1’s post-pandemic comeback - what’s at stake for Singapore?",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/big-read-fans-businesses-primed-and-eager-f1-post-pandemic-comeback-2945696,"SINGAPORE: After being prevented from travelling to Singapore for two years due to pandemic-forced border closures, Malaysian Chin Yi Yun decided to celebrate her recent freedom to travel with a big bang: By attending the Formula One (F1) Grand Prix here later this month.
“The tight and winding Singapore street circuit is truly one of a kind and I’ve missed seeing it on the calendar for the past two years,” said the 34-year-old human resource business partner from Kuala Lumpur who used to visit the Republic yearly to meet friends and loved ones. 
This will be Ms Chin’s first attendance at Singapore’s F1 race, although she had previously been to several races in her home country, as well as other cities such as the Melbourne Grand Prix in 2010 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2014. 
“Part of the charm of Formula 1 is the enthusiasm and passion of the crowd on race day and I’m very much looking forward to being a part of that energy,” said Ms Chin, who will be watching the Grand Prix with her sister who recently relocated to Singapore, and the latter’s fiance.
“We are all big fans of F1, so it's very special that we will be able to experience this race together for the first time,” said Ms Chin. Ms Chin is among thousands of fans who have bought tickets to the racing extravaganza since they went on sale on Apr 13.

F1 Singapore Grand Prix to see biggest turnout since 2008, tickets expected to sell out: S Iswaran



















Singapore Grand Prix renews contract to host Formula 1 night race













The race, which will be held from Sep 30 to Oct 2, had been cancelled for the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to TODAY’S queries, a spokesperson for race organiser and promoter Singapore GP said that ticket sales for this year’s edition are already stronger than 2019, which saw the second highest attendance since Singapore began hosting the event.
The 2019 race drew 268,000 spectators over three days, while in 2008, 300,000 people attended the inaugural race.
“Majority of the ticket categories are already sold out, or very close to selling out. We expect a sell-out event come race day on Oct 2,” the Singapore GP spokesman added.
He also said that due to the overwhelming demand, all hospitality packages have also been taken up. “We have seen particularly strong interest from companies in the financial, automotive, IT, construction, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, exhibitions), and oil and gas industries this year,” the spokesperson added.
Singapore's F1 race is more than just a glamorous racing spectacle; it is regarded as a marquee event that not only brings significant economic benefits to the country but also enhances its global branding.
Since its debut in 2008, the F1 race here has generated more than S$1.5 billion in incremental tourism receipts and attracted more than 550,000 unique international visitors.
This year, the event has taken on an added significance, since it is also meant to signal to the world that Singapore has bounced back strongly from the pandemic.
Experts say a successful hosting of the event will show that Singapore is capable of instituting the necessary measures to safeguard the health and safety of participants, attendees and personnel during major events.
This year’s race was preceded by the signing of a contract in January for Singapore to host the F1 Grand Prix for another seven years - the longest extension for the race to date. 
With the COVID-19 situation far from being tamed back then, the deal had raised a few eyebrows, with some observers pointing to uncertainties over audience turnout due to travel restrictions, and whether a live music festival - a staple of F1 races - could be held on the sidelines. 
Eight months on, Singapore - like many countries - has relaxed much of its COVID-19 restrictions as the nation settles into a state of endemicity, with masks no longer mandatory outdoors, and capacity limits for events removed in April. 
Nightlife businesses are now fully reopened, with testing limits removed in June. 
Concerns of a dull F1 season here were also removed after it was announced that the race weekend will also feature outdoor musical concerts, including 92 performances from Singapore and international acts that will take place across nine stages at the F1 Circuit Park in Marina Bay. 
With F1 fans, here and overseas, showing their enthusiasm for the race by snapping up tickets - priced from S$298 onwards - businesses and restaurants around the F1 track are hoping for their cash registers to ring non-stop during the racing week. However, they also face operational challenges in dealing with the uptick in demand.

With just two weeks to go before the flag-off, TODAY looks at how fans and businesses are getting ready to welcome the return of the men in their mighty machines and what is at stake for Singapore in hosting its largest sporting event since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
FANS ALREADY FEELING THE EXCITEMENT 
As Singapore gears up for its F1 party, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won the Italian Grand Prix on Sep 11 behind the safety car, scoring 335 points, thus clinching his fifth victory in a row and 11th from 16 races this season.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, Verstappen’s closest rival, is a distant second, with three wins.
However, if Verstappen scores 22 points more than Leclerc in the next race under the floodlights in Singapore on Oct 2, the title battle will be over. Otherwise, it will continue in Japan a week later.
With the championship title still up for grabs, F1 fans here told TODAY that they are all revved up for the action.
Having missed two years of F1 action, German national Julian Buschi, 28, could feel the “pent-up excitement” building up in him.
“One can feel it even now … F1 is already in everyone's mind and people are looking forward to it,” said the Hamburg native, who works as a chartering manager in Singapore and has lived here for four years.
Mr Buschi, who will be attending all three days of the race with either friends or clients, remarked that he missed the social aspect of such an event “with a great atmosphere around the city”. 
He still remembers fellow German Sebastian Vettel’s victory during the race he attended three years ago.
“When Vettel won his last F1 race … it (was) a big moment for us German fans,” said Mr Buschi, adding that as a child, he had been a fan of retired F1 legend Michael Schumacher.
“With Red Bull dominating the season, it seems hard to see the Ferrari or Mercedes being able to give a close fight to Verstappen, but a street circuit with possibly rain showers can make it very much unpredictable,” he added.
Mr Paviter Singh, 40, who has bought the walkabout ticket for the Sep 30 race predicted that it would be “a high energy race from the start”. He has attended the F1 event almost every year since 2011.
“I’m anticipating Lewis Hamilton to use his street racing prowess to take on Max Verstappen. It’ll be an interesting battle to watch,” said the course head of a business school, adding that he supports the Red Bull team.
He used to be a Red Bull sports ambassador before, which gave him the opportunity to visit the Red Bull pit garage in 2016 during the practice sessions, he said.
Feeling excited to see the Marina Bay Street circuit coming alive again, Mr Singh added: “The Singapore GP is not just about the race. With all the amazing performances and entertainment at various zones, it’s a weekend not to miss.”

Ms Valerie Khoo, who bought the Sunday Zone 4 walkabout ticket, hopes to see a lot of buzz around and outside of the racing circuit, such as sales of F1 merchandise and drivers’ meet-and-greet events outside of the track.
Although the 27-year-old financial planner, who first went for the race when she was 13, was eager to attend Westlife’s concert on Saturday, Oct 1, she did not manage to get the three-day ticket.
“I’m only able to catch the headline performance by Green Day on Sunday night after the race.”
Deepti Narwani, a 26-year-old account director at a football media company, became a fan after watching her first F1 race - the inaugural Singapore edition - when she was just 12.
“I just got hooked onto the whole sport …The more I started watching, the more I started to understand the technical side of it,” she said, adding that it also led her to pursue sports media as a career.
For her, it will be exhilarating to return to the stands this year.
“It feels like we are finally returning to normality and I can’t wait to watch the race in person,” she said.
Communications manager Wong Kai Yi - future brother-in-law of Ms Chin the Malaysian - fondly recalled attending the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix.
“It was a completely different era from what’s on track now, and it’s interesting to see how the sport has evolved over the past decade and a half.”
Mr Wong, 33, said that he felt relieved when he heard that the Singapore race would take place this year. “The past two years have been a rollercoaster for Formula 1 fans — uncertainty whether the Singapore Grand Prix would go ahead or not, or even be renewed.” 
Sales manager Gulshan Shah, 28, has attended every single race here since the inaugural GP in 2008 when he was 14 years old.
“And sometimes I do travel out the country to attend other races as well,” said Mr Gulshan, who bought his Padang Combination tickets - which gives him access to Zone 4 for the first night, and all zones on Oct 1 and 2 - as far back as in May for S$798.  
He is rooting for Ferrari’s victory in this race.

Fans who will be watching the race from the comfort of their homes are no less excited.
Customer success manager Ashley Pereira, 34, has not attended a single F1 race in person before, preferring to watch it on television.
“I am able to follow the race better through television. My friends and I usually gather at someone’s house to view the race.”
He added that he usually tries to get a glimpse of the practice or qualifying sessions as he loves to hear the roar of the engines as they go by. 
Anticipating a closer race between the cars and teams this year, because of the changes made to the 2022 cars, he is hoping that both Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sains Jr will be on the podium.
“But Max and Red Bull are a force to be reckoned with. And Ferrari’s pit and tyre strategy hasn’t been the best this year.”





HOTELS NEAR VENUE DELIGHT IN STRONG DEMAND
Hotels around the race venue told TODAY that they are seeing strong demand for rooms during the race week, with most expecting 100 per cent occupancy and some already fully booked.
Mr Melvin Lim, general manager of Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay, Singapore, said that bookings and demand for track-facing guest rooms have been brisk, months ahead of the race.
In response to TODAY's queries on pricing, he said: ""The rates this year are higher compared to pre-COVID years which may be attributed to the exponential increase in the level of excitement, anticipation and economic opportunities of the return of Singapore Night this month.""
He declined to elaborate on the rate of increase but added that to ride on the demand, the hotel is offering a 2022 Singapore Night Race Track View Package with rates from S$2,500++ per room per night during the race weekend.
He said that the hotel's six function rooms have also been fully booked by corporate clients and guests, along with the hotel’s accompanying food and beverage (F&B) packages. 
Apart from hosting one of the F1 teams, the hotel has also been selected to provide catering services for trackside hospitality suites, Mr Lim added. 
“We are optimistic that as a whole, the business for this year’s race will be exceptionally positive for the hotel,” he said. 
 
Ms Jeane Lim, general manager of Grand Park City Hall, said that enquiries for rooms began after the F1 tickets went on sale on Apr 13.
“So far, the demand is on par with what we observed in the last race in 2019. We are expecting full occupancy for stays from Sep 29 to Oct 2 as bookings are continuing apace,” she said.
Over at Conrad Centennial Singapore, general manager Mike Williamson said that demand for room reservations during the race weekend has been strong since June, with levels returning to that of pre-pandemic times and the pricing of rooms “based on occupancy and demand”. 
He added that the hotel has curated F1-themed experiences for guests to immerse in the thrill of the race during their stay at Conrad Singapore.
 
“Between Sep 30 and Oct 3, guests can challenge themselves to a test drive at one of three race simulators set up at the lobby. The driver with the fastest lap time each day will receive a prize, with all daily winners invited to complete a final race on Oct 3 where the ultimate champion will be crowned.” 
He added that guests checking into the hotel during the period will receive a special F1-themed welcome amenity.
Operating times and services have also been adjusted to better cater to guests' needs, with in-room dining available 24 hours from Sep 26 till Oct 3 and extended hours of the service of drinks at some sections within the hotel.
“Housekeeping services will be shifted to start later than our usual 9am, so guests returning after a late night can continue to sleep in and have a good rest.”

Fairmont Singapore and Swissôtel The Stamford managing director Marcus Hanna said that the hotels’ take-up rate has been higher than originally anticipated, thanks in part to their ""ideal location"" along the race track offering superb views.
The two hotels expect revenue for the race weekend to be ""far ahead"" of previous years, he said, adding: “COVID-19 seems to have created a pent-up demand, especially for events and experiences that were not possible during the pandemic.”

Wearing a mask to be optional from Aug 29, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities



















Vaccination-differentiated rules remain for F&B outlets, large events, nightlife venues even as mask-wearing becomes optional













BARS, RESTAURANTS GRAPPLE WITH SUPPLY-SIDE CONSTRAINTS
While restaurants, especially those near the F1 venue, are expecting to reap dividends from burgeoning demand during the race week, some are worried about whether they have the capacity to handle it. 
Mr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said that many restaurants and operators in the F&B sector already have a waitlist for diners, mainly due to a surge in tourist consumption demand for that period.
“F&B sectors (are) primary beneficiaries and thereafter the retail sector. There are many events, non-F1-related, that have also been organised before or after F1 to encourage more incoming traffic (to these outlets),” he said.
A spokesperson of the Restaurant Association of Singapore said that while the industry is “delighted with the return of large-scale events to Singapore”, it would still need to grapple with several challenges.
Agreeing, Mr Nasen Thiagarajan, president of the Singapore Nightlife Business Association, cited manpower shortage as a key challenge during the F1 period for nightlife and F&B operators.
“To cope with demand during F1, businesses are looking at their operating hours to close off low periods and focus on peak periods in order to utilise their manpower better,” said Mr Nasen, who is also the chief executive officer of Harry’s International, which operates a chain of bars and restaurants across Singapore.
He added that labour costs, which have already skyrocketed in recent months, will be even higher for the week of F1, especially for part-timers as multiple industries compete to secure manpower.
He estimated manpower costs to be 30 per cent higher than the F1 period in 2019. 
Although Mr Nasen believes this F1 will yield higher revenues for nightspots, profits are likely to be lower as a result of business owners being able to deploy their limited staff only during periods where high revenue opportunities are forecasted, instead of optimising business hours. 
“High costs due to utilities, raw materials, operating expenses, logistics, transport would also be another reason (for lower profits).”
Mr Stephane Colleoni, the owner of OSO Italian Restaurant at Peck Seah Street in Tanjong Pagar, said that reservations in his restaurant have been full for the past five months.
“I have constantly been getting calls all week for further reservations but I am unable to accept any more,” he said.
Like Mr Nasen, Mr Colleoni also wishes that he is able to employ more waiters and cooks to cater to the hot demand during the F1 period.
“I do not want to employ part-timers. I prefer having full-time workers but they are low in supply.”
Despite the manpower challenges, some new businesses which opened this year are still hoping to cash in on the F1 frenzy. 
A spokesperson for Singapura Club, an establishment selling pan-Asian cuisine, said that the outlet is expected to be “80 per cent full” during the F1 week, adding that tourists have been coming in for the past one to two months.
“Our restaurant will be displaying F1 flags and posters (and) we are having a live band,” she added.

Two limousine drivers also told TODAY that there has been an increase in demand for their services too for the F1 week.
“I can see overseas clients are coming back for business trips and leisure. So I guess, it's a good sign and (I) expect more coming in,” said Mr Yusup Baliah, who drives for Straits Limousine.
However, he added, the industry is facing a shortage of drivers due to high rental and running costs. “We do face problems ... when a high volume of bookings comes in, we have to reject bookings.”
Agreeing, a driver from Bon Limousine company said that in spite of increased demand, the lack of manpower meant that not all the bookings could be accepted.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SINGAPORE? 
This year’s F1 race represents an important turning point for Singapore, a harbinger of a vibrant, post-COVID-19 economy, said several industry and marketing experts.
Associate Professor Ang Swee Hoon from the Department of Marketing, National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, said that being able to keep to the commitment of hosting the event shows the nation’s dependability.
“Singapore has been preparing ourselves to be a safe and gracious host to various international events. F1 marks the first major international event in this endeavour that Singapore is ready to welcome the world of sports, and specifically F1 racing, to the nation,” she added.
Agreeing, Professor Lawrence Loh, director at NUS Business School's Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said that a successful hosting of the F1 is ""the most visible signal to the world that Singapore is back in business despite the pandemic"".
He added that Singapore's risk-taking attitude in signing a long renewal deal for the F1 and in confirming this year's race at the start of the year seems to be yielding good returns.
“Nothing ventured, nothing gained. The gambit seems to be paying off as many countries have opened up - global aviation is bursting at the seams lately, it’s a happy problem.”
Some analysts however cautioned that a few things could potentially put a damper on the event, such as instances of COVID-19 cases and outbreaks among the F1 teams and drivers, and possibly even the entertainers flying in.
“F1 has been taking significant precautions with regular testing and managing of close contacts, so this risk is minimised,"" said Mr James Walton, sports business group leader of Deloitte Southeast Asia.
""However, the organisers may have to be prepared for the scenario that headline acts could get cancelled at short notice in the event of an infection.” 
TODAY has sent queries to Singapore GP and STB about the safe management measures and vaccination policies for participating drivers and performers.
On its website, Singapore GP says that ""all patrons attending the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2022 must be fully vaccinated"".
This is in line with Singapore's vaccination-differentiated safe management measures for activities and events involving more than 500 people.
""In order to safely host the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2022, Singapore GP will continue to work with the Singapore Government on the implementation of safe management measures throughout the Circuit Park,"" said Singapore GP on its website.
""Singapore GP reserves the right to change the programmes, facilities, services and off-track activities on offer if required to do so to adhere to prevailing safe management measures."" 
Mr Walton noted that earlier this year - when Singapore announced in late January that it would host the 2022 Grand Prix - there were questions about whether the event would be at full capacity; whether safe distancing would still be practised; and whether tourists would be able, and willing, to fly in.
“There was a feeling then, though, that there would be enough of a time period, given the direction the COVID-19 pandemic was heading, that would bring resolution to these issues,"" he added.
""We have been fortunate that there has not been another major variant with more severe implications that could thwart the plans or deliver a setback.”

While Singapore has staged major sporting events this year without incident, they were not huge ones.
“The HSBC Rugby 7s earlier this year (in April) had restricted capacity (and masks on) and the preseason European club football friendlies were a much more ‘local event’ with few regional attendees,” said Mr Walton. 
Still, the experts note that the timing of the race at this time of the year works in Singapore's favour, given that the COVID-19 situation has stabilised and that most restrictions have been lifted.
The reopening of Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 4 - in October and September respectively - has also demonstrated Singapore's resilience while driving business and consumer confidence as part of the road to recovery, said Mr Paul Kent, a partner at consultancy firm KPMG in Singapore.
“It goes towards positioning Singapore as a destination for a full experience, rather than just a stop-over location and is expected to contribute significantly to the four to six million international visitors that Singapore expects this year.”
Matthew Marsh, a former British racing driver and presenter of online TV show GoF1, also observed that while most of the F1 races in other countries were also sold out, things did not go smoothly in some places which were not able to cope with a return of the crowds.
He told TODAY that while races such as the British Grand Prix and Italian Grand Prix were impressive, other events like the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona and Hungarian Grand Prix had “poor traffic management”.
Also, certain other venues having races such as the Miami Grand Prix faced logistical and manpower issues in its hotels and restaurants. 
He described Singapore’s Grand Prix as having a “fantastic kind of combination of private enterprise and public involvement ... (which) works brilliantly”.
He noted that while it's not unique for a grand prix to be promoted in this way, no one else has managed to do it as well as Singapore has.
“The Singapore Grand Prix took the quality level and experience level that's typical around the world to a new and higher level. So I'm expecting more of the same this year,” he said.
“I can tell you also that it's the Grand Prix that is most popular with people who work in the sport. I've never heard anybody speak negatively about it.""

Singapore and India to partner in fintech innovations,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mas-india-partner-fintech-innovations-dpm-lawrence-wong-2947081,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and India’s International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) signed an agreement on Sunday (Sep 18) to facilitate regulatory collaboration and partnership in fintech. 
The agreement will promote regulatory sandbox collaboration and sharing of non-supervisory related information on fintech innovation projects, MAS and IFSCA said in a joint statement.
Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong witnessed the signing while on an official trip to Gujarat. Mr Wong is also the deputy chairman of MAS.
In his speech during the event, Mr Wong celebrated the growing partnership between the two countries and called the FinTech Cooperation Agreement a “landmark agreement because it is also the first of its kind for both parties to focus on cooperation through joint regulatory sandboxes”.
He added that the Singapore Government hopes that the agreement will open up the space for fintech companies from both countries to experiment and pilot their innovations, which will in turn help create new jobs and investments. 
Under the agreement, MAS and IFSCA will leverage existing regulatory sandboxes in their respective jurisdictions to support experimentation of technology innovations. 
Chief Technology Officer of IFSCA Joseph Joshy said he hopes this partnership will usher in a “fintech bridge to serve as a launch pad for Indian fintechs to Singapore and landing pad for Singapore fintechs to India, leveraging the regulatory sandboxes”.

3 in 5 'excess deaths' in Singapore during COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus: MOH,"""Excess deaths"" refers to the increased death rate during the pandemic, compared to the rate expected in the absence of a pandemic. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/3-5-excess-deaths-singapore-during-covid-19-pandemic-caused-virus-moh-2947041,"SINGAPORE: Nearly three in five ""excess deaths"" in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic were directly caused by the coronavirus, and the remainder were patients who had died of other illnesses within 90 days of being infected.
In a report released on Sunday (Sep 18), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that Singapore recorded an estimated 2,490 excess deaths during the pandemic from January 2020 to June 2022.  
Of these, 1,403 were Singapore residents who died from COVID-19.
The term ""excess deaths"" refers to the increased death rate during the pandemic, compared to the rate expected in the absence of a pandemic. 
Two in five excess deaths were people who had died from other illnesses after being infected with the coronavirus.
""In other words, COVID-19 aggravated existing illnesses, resulting in death,"" said MOH. 
The Health Ministry noted that compared to other countries, Singapore has managed to keep its COVID-19 death toll low.

The report also explored possible reasons for the excess deaths, with MOH suggesting that the pandemic may have changed people's ""health-seeking behaviours"", such as putting off health screening and medication for chronic illnesses. 
But a more significant explanation is death due to underlying medical conditions made worse by COVID-19, MOH said. 
""The gap between (the) official death toll and estimated excess deaths can be explained by deaths in patients recently infected with COVID-19 in the past 90 days.

MOH said that among COVID-19 deaths, people who were not fully vaccinated were ""over-represented"", accounting for 28 per cent of deaths occurring in the first half of this year, even though only about 5 per cent of the eligible population had not been fully vaccinated as of mid-March. 
The ministry also said that while Singapore's public hospitals were strained during the pandemic, intensive care beds ""were able to support patients with urgent medical needs"". 
But the Health Ministry urged the public to ""be mindful that when healthcare capacity is overburdened during a pandemic, it will have very adverse impact on health outcomes from other diseases. 
""As such, preserving healthcare capacity and ensuring that our healthcare workers are well-resourced remain priorities"". 
Editor's note: A reference in this article to how there were no overall excess deaths after excluding recently infected people from the analysis has been removed after MOH updated its report.

Ethnic-based self-help groups relevant as Singapore raises socio-economic levels: PM Lee,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ethnic-based-self-help-groups-relevant-singapore-raises-socio-economic-levels-pm-lee-2947021,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's four ethnic-based Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are still relevant as the country continues to raise socio-economic levels and provide opportunities for everyone, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Sep 18). 
Speaking at an event to mark the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Mr Lee said that as Singapore's economy develops and the external environment becomes more challenging, ""economic growth will be harder to come by, and social mobility will be tougher to sustain"". 
That's where SHGs can assist in giving extra help to those who are not doing as well as others, he said.
While the ethnic-based groups - the CDAC, Mendaki, SINDA and the Eurasian Association - receive some government funding, they mostly operate on donations from their respective communities. For CDAC,  contributions range between S$0.50 and S$3 per month. 
In this way, SHGs ""are a vehicle for more successful Singaporeans to help and support fellow members from their own communities"", said Mr Lee. 
""It is a very natural human impulse, and it strengthens the bonds between members of the community,"" he added. 
Mr Lee also made a case for supporting ethnic-based SHGs in Singapore's multiracial society, instead of creating one outfit to serve everyone. 
The four SHGs ""better understand the unique characteristics and needs of their different communities"" and can also address issues ""forthrightly, without raising racial or religious sensitivities"", he pointed out. 
""We will lose something precious if we do not have the SHGs"", Mr Lee said. 
But he also encouraged the SHGs to collaborate with one another ""to reinforce Singapore's social compact and strengthen our multiracial identity"". 
The groups currently run joint programmes - like the Collaborative Tuition Programme and Big Heart Student Care Centres - which cater to students from all races. 
Another project - special centre Vibrance @ Yishun - is also in the works, and will cater to all students as well, Mr Lee said.
Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that the $0.50 and S$3 range of monthly donations only applies to CDAC."
About 700 users in Bedok face fibre broadband services disruption due to damaged cables,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/about-700-users-bedok-face-fibre-broadband-services-disruption-due-damaged-cables-2946956,"SINGAPORE: A fibre service outage on Sunday (Sep 18) that affected broadband services in parts of Bedok has been resolved at 9pm, NetLink Trust said in a statement. 
In an initial statement earlier on Sunday afternoon, the company said the outage could disrupt the Internet connection for about 700 end-users. 
NetLink Trust builds, owns and operates Singapore's passive fibre network infrastructure. 
The company said the outage was caused by ""a third party's contractor carrying out construction activity"". NetLink Trust will investigate the matter and ""take all necessary actions against the errant party"", it said. 
On its website, NetLink Trust explained that such incidents occur when its underground fibre cables are cut or damaged, affecting the Internet services of some end-users. 
The extent of the outage depends on the severity of the damage done to the fibre cables. 
NetLink Trust said that its recovery team ""worked closely with all relevant parties to ensure that the service to the affected area was restored as soon as possible"". Those still affected should call their Internet Service Providers, the company said. 
NetLink Trust said on its website that from 2013 to 2018, there were 23 cable cuts caused by third-party contractors involved in the construction of new MRT lines, power cabling, water and sewage piping works and other development projects."
From Queen Elizabeth to Yusof Ishak: The banknotes that tell the story of Singapore,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/queen-elizabeth-yusof-ishak-banknotes-illustrate-singapore-history-2940936,"SINGAPORE: One of the more everyday realities that people in Britain will face following the death of Queen Elizabeth II is that the country's banknotes will change.
Instead of the face of Britain's longest-reigning monarch, who died at the age of 96 on Sep 8, people will use money adorned with an image of King Charles III.
Most countries' banknotes reflect their history, and Singapore is no exception. 
From British colony through to independence and beyond, Singapore's banknotes tell the story of a country making significant changes in its political landscape, its urban landscape and its priorities.

CHANGING OF THE GUARD
For most of the colonial era in Singapore, the island was governed as part of the Straits Settlements, a crown colony that also included Malacca (now known as Melaka) and Penang, and later Labuan, an island off the coast of Borneo.
In the early 20th century, the currency used in the colony was the Straits dollar.
Singapore was mentioned on this dollar's notes, with one from 1924 declaring: ""The government of the Straits Settlements promises to pay the bearer on demand one dollar at Singapore local currency for value received"".

Even at this early stage, something at the heart of Singapore's national identity was apparent.
On a few Straits dollar notes that are now more than a century old, values were expressed in four languages: Malay (in Jawi script), English, Chinese and Tamil.
Another aspect of the currency would survive well into the post-independence era.
The highest denominations of the Straits dollar – $1,000 as seen at a 1999 auction in Melbourne, and $10,000 as seen in specimen form at a 2017 London auction – would also be closely associated with modern-day Singapore.
Singapore's S$10,000 and S$1,000 banknotes are among the most valuable circulating banknotes in the world today in terms of face value, although the issuance of the former ended in 2014, and the latter in 2021.
In the 1930s, the Straits dollar depicted the monarch of the day, George V. But the king's reign was nearing its end.

In 1936, following the death of the king and the infamous abdication of his heir Edward VIII, George VI inherited the throne.
By 1940, the Straits dollar's reach had expanded to include the Malay states, and the currency got a new name – the Malayan dollar.

George VI now appeared on the notes, as did the crests of the entities where the new dollar was legal tender.
Within the coat of arms of the Straits Settlements, Singapore was represented by a lion atop a castle tower.
By this time, a colour scheme was established for the banknotes of the colony that anyone familiar with today's Singapore dollar would immediately recognise – green for the $5, red for the $10 and a distinctive greyish blue for the $50.

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE
The Malayan dollar survived World War II, when it was briefly replaced by the Japanese invasion currency popularly and derisively referred to as ""banana notes"".
But great changes were afoot once the war was over.
In 1946, the Straits Settlements colony was broken up, with Malacca and Penang joining the newly formed Malayan Union – later to be called the Federation of Malaya in 1948. Labuan, meanwhile, was incorporated into British North Borneo – modern-day Sabah.
And as for Singapore, it became a separate crown colony.
In 1952, George VI died, and he was succeeded by his older daughter, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary.
Just over a month before the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the throne in 1952, a currency board came into being that would issue another new currency for the array of British territories in the region: The Malaya and British Borneo dollar.

      The reverse of a Malaya and British Borneo $1 dollar note bearing the date Mar 21, 1953. (Image: CNA/Kurt Ganapathy)
    







The first notes of this currency carry the date Mar 21, 1953, on them, but according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), they did not reach the country's shores until 1954.
The notes came in seven denominations – $1, $5, $10, $50, $100, $1,000 and $10,000 – and depicted the newly crowned queen.
On the back of the notes were the crests of the individual Malayan states, the Federation of Malaya, Brunei, North Borneo, Sarawak and – taking a prominent place at top and centre – Singapore.
In the first decade of her reign, the queen played a ceremonial role in the lives of Singaporeans, although she was not involved in day-to-day governance, said Dr Donna Brunero, deputy head of the Department of History at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
""For the vast majority of people in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s, the connection to the queen was not direct or personal, but her image and aspects of her public life – reporting on the queen’s activities and speeches was a regular practice – were widely circulated,"" Dr Brunero told CNA.
""She personified Britain and the Crown. People's everyday lives were shaped by British colonial policies relating to education, legal systems, language and even currency.""

Just one year into the life of these first notes of Elizabeth II's reign, in 1955, Singapore would be granted partial internal self-government.
""For political activists – nationalists – the early 1950s were the backdrop to finding a local voice and forming political parties and working towards Singapore's independence from British rule,"" said Dr Brunero, who noted that the People's Action Party (PAP) was formed during this period.
Legislative assembly elections that year saw David Marshall take the helm as Singapore's first chief minister, and in the south of the island, a 31-year-old lawyer named Lee Kuan Yew won the seat of Tanjong Pagar in a three-cornered fight.
Queen Elizabeth II sent a congratulatory message to Singapore as the assembly – a forerunner to Parliament – met for the first time.
""In this message, she spoke of her satisfaction at Singapore's constitutional progress and of the responsibilities the Council of Ministers now held for the advancement and prosperity of Singapore and its citizens,"" said Dr Brunero.

In 1957, the Federation of Malaya gained its independence, and in 1958, the UK parliament passed the State of Singapore Act following negotiations in London.
The Act granted Singapore full self-governance with effect from the 1959 general election. In that election on May 30, 1959, the PAP led by Mr Lee swept to power, taking 43 out of 51 seats.
Mr Lee was sworn in as Singapore's first prime minister on Jun 5.
""The relationship between Singapore and Britain changed dramatically in the 1950s and 60s as Singapore moved towards becoming a self-governing state,"" said Dr Brunero.
""As Singapore became an independent country, connections to Britain definitely changed – Singapore no longer looked to Britain for decisions on internal or external policy; it was self-governing.
""But a connection remained, particularly in terms of a British presence via military bases, trade links and aspects of popular culture.""
This changing relationship would be made evident in the final banknotes of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar.

A COLLECTOR IS BORN
It was at around this time that Mr Soon Seng Kai began collecting paper money, his daughter Ms Lynn Soon told CNA.
""My dad started his collection with the Malaya pieces – both George VI and QEII portraits – because these were common currency then when he started collecting in his early 30s,"" the banknote collector and dealer said.
For him, notes depicting the young queen had and have a particular appeal.
""Personally, for my father, he finds the pieces with the young and pretty queen portraits 'nice to look at',"" said Ms Soon. ""It is just simple aesthetic appeal.""
""Before QEII, the portraits on the Straits Settlements and Malaya notes and coins (were all of) middle-aged males; not that nice to look (at),"" she added in a light-hearted reflection, noting that it was not common to find a female monarch's face on banknotes at that time.
Mr Soon's interest in banknotes would last a lifetime and cross into a new generation. Today, at the age of 88, the man known to friends as Ah Soon still runs a shop selling coins and banknotes at Chinatown Complex on Smith Street.

FIVE STARS AND A CRESCENT MOON
The long day of British rule, in the words of English author Anthony Burgess (of A Clockwork Orange fame), was waning.
In 1959, the queen disappeared from the Malaya and British Borneo dollar's new $1 banknotes, replaced by what MAS describes as ""elements of Malayan life"".
Mr Keh Wee Kwang, the owner of Emporium Antiquities, describes the elements on the two notes of this final series as ""a sailing boat design"" and ""an ox with (a) farmer ploughing"".
With full self-governance, Singapore introduced a new coat of arms designed by a committee led by then Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye.
It had five stars and a crescent moon on a red shield supported by a lion and a tiger. And beneath them, a banner bearing the words ""Majulah Singapura"".
In 1961, a new $10 note was introduced for the Malaya and British Borneo dollar.
It would be the last new banknote issued before Singapore's independence, Ms Soon and Mr Keh confirmed, and it was also the first to feature Singapore's now-familiar State Crest.

While Singapore gained independence as part of Malaysia alongside Sabah and Sarawak in 1963, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar continued to be used in the new country. Its use also continued in Brunei, which would remain a British protectorate until 1984.
But this common ground, like Singapore's merger with Malaysia, would not last.
In 1967, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei went their separate ways on the currency front and began issuing their own notes.
Mr Soon remembers the final $10 notes being a symbol of this changeover.
""My father remembered people – likely towkays – trying to sell bundles of the $10 notes or wanting to return the pieces to the bank when it ceased to be legal tender,"" Ms Soon said.
Two years on from Singapore's independence from Malaysia, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar faded into history, replaced by the Singapore dollar.
And where one would have once expected to see the queen's portrait, orchids bloomed.

CHARTING A NEW COURSE
The Orchid Series, the first banknote series of the new Singapore dollar, was printed from 1967 to 1976, and it reflected the realities of a new nation finding its feet on its own.
The reverse sides of these notes mainly depicted waterfront scenes and government buildings, but two notes instead represented everyday life in this stage of nation-building.
The first, the S$1 note, had an image of buildings – blocks of flats in a housing estate.
The second, the S$10 note, had more abstract imagery: Four hands of people of different races clasped together over a map of the country. This motif would be revisited 50 years later in the logo of the 2017 National Day Parade.

The Bird Series succeeded the Orchid Series in 1976, and would last for eight years.
These notes showed a country that was gaining confidence as it celebrated its identity, recognised its achievements and looked forward to the promise of the future.
A scene from a National Day Parade, dancers from different ethnic groups, the Singapore Cable Car, modern public housing, a shipping terminal and an oil refinery all appeared.
So did Changi Airport as the backdrop to a supersonic Concorde aircraft bearing the livery of Singapore Airlines.
When this image on the back of the S$20 note first appeared in August of 1979, the airport was still about two years away from welcoming travellers.

The Ship Series made its debut in 1984, and featured many of the same elements as its predecessor.
Technology and engineering were celebrated in these notes, through the Sentosa Satellite Earth Station on the S$1 note and the Benjamin Sheares Bridge on the S$50 note.
Members of the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Civil Defence Force also received recognition on the S$500 note.

Singapore's current banknote series, the Portrait Series, arrived in 1999 at the dawn of a new millennium.
The banknotes of this series – the first Singapore dollar banknotes to feature a portrait as their main design theme – each depict the country's first president, Yusof Ishak.
Their reverse sides represent broad themes: ""Education"", ""Garden City"", ""Sports"", ""Arts"", ""Youth"", ""Government"" and ""Economics"".

LIFE AFTER THE QUEEN
In the years since her removal from Singapore's money, Queen Elizabeth II remained popular with collectors of coins and banknotes.
Singapore's story of independence in the decades after World War II was not unique. Over the years, the queen made similar debuts and departures on the banknotes of dozens of countries and territories around the world – from Hong Kong and Mauritius to Rhodesia and Ceylon.
To own banknotes portraying her therefore often means owning tangible pieces of history.
""The British Commonwealth has sizeable political and economic influence, and her portraits are on 33 countries' currencies, so it is a good and challenging – but manageable – goal to collect and complete a QE banknote collection. It is an achievement one can be proud of,"" Ms Soon said, noting that about a third of world banknote collectors focus on Commonwealth pieces.
At the time of her death, the queen was still on the currency in places like Australia, Belize, Canada, New Zealand, a number of Caribbean states and, of course, the United Kingdom and its territories.
Banknote collecting is a hobby that has enjoyed a renaissance over the last two years while travel was difficult or impossible because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms Soon shared. 
Because of Singapore's historical links with Britain and the Commonwealth, this meant that particular interest was directed towards Queen Elizabeth II banknotes.
The view of old banknotes as an investment class also spurred on collectors who acknowledged that the queen would not be around forever, Ms Soon noted.
""(In the) last two years, some started collecting QEII notes as she was in advanced age and would pass away soon,"" she said.
""They buy on the presumption (that) … the notes will not lose value and may appreciate in value.""
Mr Keh noted that prices of the notes had been on the rise.
""Amongst the more experienced banknote collectors, Queen Elizabeth II banknotes have been popular and the prices have steadily increased over the years,"" he said.
""I will (say) the prices have been surely going up, at the rate of 5 per cent to 10 per cent year-over-year.""
Ms Soon noticed this as well.
""(Prices of) the Malaya and North Borneo pieces went up a lot (in the) last two years – presumably due to interest from these newly minted 'COVID period' collectors – but prices have softened since early this year,"" she said.
""Nevertheless, it is more likely that uncirculated and/or desirable pieces will keep their prices well even if one had bought at height of a price boom, as long as the QEII banknote collecting appetite is there.""

A CONTINUED PRESENCE
But will the interest in collecting these notes live on as she begins to be replaced by King Charles III and figures with more local significance in the Commonwealth realms where she was head of state?
""Personally, I believe that her passing has an influence on the collector's desire for such notes,"" said Mr Keh.
""Of course, if we look solely at Singapore, it was a British colony and there is also a factor of familiarity (with) British colonial roots.
""The younger queen's portrait will be especially popular.""
Mr Keh believes that any spike in interest will eventually dissipate, however, with appreciation falling back to the general level associated with old banknotes.
Ms Soon thinks that the demand for Queen Elizabeth II notes will be there for at least a decade, as existing collectors try to complete their collections and investor-collectors add more pieces to their portfolios.
Non-collectors may also purchase a few notes as souvenirs to remember the queen – and end up becoming collectors in the process.
Ms Soon pointed out that there are still many who collect notes from the reign of another well-liked monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, six years on from his death.
Whether or not the interest endures, the queen will continue to have a presence in Singapore in at least one way.
""The connection to Queen Elizabeth – and the British Empire – can also be seen in the landscape, for instance, the naming of Queen Elizabeth Walk – in 1953 – and, later, the naming of Queenstown, Singapore's first satellite town,"" said Dr Brunero.
""And places and roads in Queenstown are named after towns and cities in Scotland where the queen spent much of her childhood: Strathmore Avenue and Dundee Road are just some of the places named with a connection to Queen Elizabeth II."""
'I was eager to serve further': The SAF soldiers with no qualms about extending their service,"One full-time national serviceman chose to enter medical school later to finish and extend his NS. Another operationally ready national serviceman continues to do in-camp training each year even though he does not need to.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-extend-national-service-ict-reservist-saf-2929056,"SINGAPORE: When 3rd Sergeant (NS) Shaun Wee, 21, was offered in July 2021 to study medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS), the then-full-time national serviceman (NSF) had a difficult decision to make.
While medical school enrolment was in August that year, his operationally ready date (ORD) would only be in November.
Like all eligible male medical students in Singapore, he was given the option of disrupting full-time NS, where he was an air defence weapons specialist in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).
This means he would enrol in NUS in August, finish around seven years of the medical course including housemanship and hospital postings, then return to the military to serve the remaining few months of service.
The other option was to finish his full-time NS and wait almost a year for the next medical school enrolment in August 2022.

This young man lost his arm and could be exempted from NS. He chose to serve anyway













He eventually chose this option, attributing his decision to his ""meaningful"" time in NS and his intention to continue serving the country in his air defence role.
Singapore commemorates 55 years of NS this year, more than five decades after Parliament passed the National Service (Amendment) Bill on Mar 14, 1967 to build up the newly independent country's defence force.
The Bill made NS compulsory for all 18-year-old male Singapore citizens and permanent residents.
That year, about 9,000 male youths born between Jan 1 and Jun 30 in 1949 became the first batch to be called up for NS, which has over the years become a rite of passage for many Singaporean sons.
PROS AND CONS
While weighing his options, 3SG (NS) Wee could not discount the camaraderie he shared with his NS mates.
""The friends that I met here, we've been together since almost a year, and we've been doing everything together. We've been going for exercises, training, and all the admin stuff we have to do in camp,"" he told CNA.
""So, I felt very bonded with my peers and I really wanted to just see it through to the end with my peers.""
Beyond emotions, 3SG (NS) Wee also considered practical reasons, highlighting that a new batch of NSFs was about to join the squadron and replace the outgoing NSFs.
""I think it was more of me just wanting to continue to help with the operational commitments,"" he said.
""I thought that if I rejected the offer of (disruption) ... I will be able to properly and thoroughly train them to make sure that they understood their duties and roles and responsibilities well.""
By this point, it was clear which option 3SG (NS) Wee was leaning towards, but there was something else to consider: An option to further extend his full-time NS by six months until May 2022.
""I would have a lot of time on my hands until school started,"" he said.
""I felt I wanted to do something meaningful. So when I heard that I had the opportunity to extend if I didn't disrupt, it was also one of the factors that convinced me to not disrupt and just complete my NS.""

When asked why he did not intend to use the time to travel or go on an internship, he reiterated that he wanted to do something worthwhile.
As an NSF, he operated the agile multiple beam radar, a highly mobile radar that can detect low-flying and slower-moving targets, such as helicopters, 60km away.
""Having trained in the past year as an air defence weapons specialist in my unit, I felt that I was contributing meaningfully to the security of our skies,"" he said.
""If I go out and work part-time, there are also meaningful things that I could learn outside. But I felt I was enjoying what I did.""
While one of his peers, also interested in extending his service, encouraged him to take up the option together, others were not as convinced.
""There will be those people who want to just get NS over and done with, but when we try to properly explain to them our rationale, they eventually kind of say fine, sure - makes a bit of sense,"" he said.
""I just told them not everyone will get the opportunity to extend their NS ... especially as our job scope or vocation is not a very common one as well. Having already trained for so long, and being good at what we're doing, it'll be a bit of a shame to waste it.""
BREAKING THE NEWS
He took his intentions to his parents, unsure about how they would react.
""Of course, I had to talk to them about it. I sat down not knowing what they would think, and I told them my intentions,"" he said.
""When they heard ... they actually encouraged me to go ahead and do it. They felt I was going down the right path doing something meaningful. So they really supported me and I really appreciated that.""

Some parents and their children would think twice about starting university one year late and entering the workface later, but 3SG (NS) Wee brushed aside such concerns.
""For me, I wasn't too worried about that. I didn't really see it as much of a problem. I've had peers from junior college who also got into medicine, and they all deferred and started school earlier,"" he said.
""Some people ask me, 'Don't you feel like you won't be joining them, then you are alone in a lower batch?' But actually it is quite good because now they are my seniors in school. And if I need any help, I can just ask them, and they'll be very willing to help.""
Looking back, 3SG (NS) Wee said it was ultimately not a ""very straightforward"" decision as he had to consider different factors. He mulled over it for a week and discussed his options with his parents and friends for different perspectives.
""I also consulted with some of my peers who were already in medical school on what they thought was the best course of action, and eventually came to the conclusion that there was no harm in turning down the (disruption) and starting my university studies a year later,"" he said.
OVERSEAS EXERCISE
3SG (NS) Wee took the plunge and rejected the disruption before changing his ORD date on the university portal.
He spent the extra months building even closer relationships with the regulars and newcomers in his squadron, but the highlight was getting the opportunity to attend Exercise Cope Tiger in Thailand. Held from Mar 13 to 25, the exercise involved the RSAF and the Thai and US air forces.
3SG (NS) Wee said he welcomed the chance to interact with personnel from both the US and Thailand, adding that he initially perceived the Thai servicemen to be ""very strong and maybe stubborn"".
""But they were super nice. They were so hospitable and actually very friendly. We made friends with them, and we still keep in contact and text once in a while,"" he said.
""There was a language barrier; they didn't speak much English and we didn't speak Thai. Most of the time we had to use third-party apps like Google Translate to converse with each other. But it was very interesting.""

The scorching weather in the day and much cooler temperatures at night also meant that he had to be resilient and persevere through ""demanding conditions"".
""Not many NSFs have the opportunity to participate in an overseas exercise, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.
Overall, 3SG (NS) Wee said he had no regrets completing and extending his full-time NS, as he advised servicemen considering the option to have an ""open mind"" and weigh the pros and cons objectively.
""Personally, I enjoyed what I was doing and I was eager to serve further, so there was no harm in extending my service. I do not regret my decision and have learnt many valuable skills that I can apply to my life,"" he added.
THE ""REGULAR NSMAN""
Like 3SG (NS) Wee, 1st Warrant Officer (NS) Surindranath Kaseenathan, 47, also found a way to extend his service, albeit at a much later stage.
1WO (NS) Surindranath finished full-time NS, where he was an armoured infantry specialist, in 1997. He then became an NSman, completing his in-camp training (ICT) cycles over the next decade.
In 2005, 1WO (NS) Surindranath's superiors approached him about extending his service as a volunteer NSman, based on his performance and conduct during his years of ICT. He went for interviews to talk about how far he would go.
His final NSman appointment was company sergeant major (CSM), usually the highest non-officer role in a company.
""I stated that I would like to continue. I mean, If I can contribute, I'm more than happy to contribute,"" he said.
""Because as far as the defence of the country is concerned, there shouldn't be an age limit in that sense. We should contribute for as long as we can. That's my personal belief.""
He also wanted to act as a mentor to junior commanders, sharing his experiences with them to ease their NS experience and make it more enriching.
1WO (NS) Surindranath, who was working at the Ministry of Education headquarters then, said his employer was very supportive of his decision and did not harbour any ""misgivings"".
""When I said I was going to take up a higher appointment, my employers were actually very proud of me and they were very encouraging,"" he said.

1WO (NS) Surindranath finished his NS liabilities in 2008 and extended his service, soon becoming a regimental sergeant major (RSM) taking charge of several companies in a unit.
He now does about 30 days of ICT each year as a brigade sergeant major - an even higher appointment overseeing several units - of the 56th Singapore Armoured Brigade.
As a volunteer NSman, the current administration manager at Kheng Cheng School still gets paid his usual salary during ICT.
""Of course, on my part, I also make sure that before I go for ICT, there are proper handovers, making sure that things that need to be done are all settled,"" he said, calling it a ""two-way thing"".
""I am also thankful for my fellow colleagues who have volunteered to cover my duties in my absence.""
JUGGLING COMMITMENTS
Nevertheless, 1WO (NS) Surindranath acknowledged that he had doubts about extending his service, pointing to the uncertainty around getting used to a new appointment.
""You really don't know what's in store for you. As you go up, the journey to a certain extent becomes a bit lonelier; you have less people to talk to,"" he said.
""When you're coming up as a CSM, you can still find out from people certain things. Even then there's only like four or five CSMs in the unit ... Becoming RSM, you're the only one in the unit. Who are you going to go to for help?
""I did share that these are the things I need help with. Of course, they were all very supportive. There was quite a bit of mentorship from above, which is what I am doing in return as well.""
There were also some concerns beyond his professional life, having to balance his time between his civilian job, NS and family commitments.
""My children were both toddlers at that time and required much attention. I had to manage my time carefully, and thankfully received strong support from my family,"" he said.
Still, he recalled his daughter and son, then aged four and one, feeling proud when they saw him in uniform.
""Especially when they were youngsters, they look at you like you're a hero. That's very encouraging and uplifting,"" he said, adding that his family also attended several of his parades.
STILL SCORING IN IPPT
As a brigade sergeant major, 1WO (NS) Surindranath ensures that the units under him conduct training properly. He also gathers feedback from the ground and listens to his soldiers' challenges and concerns, saying this is important to keep up their morale.
""I always believe in leadership by example. So if you ask somebody to go there at 7am, you jolly well be there at 7am, not strut in (late) just because you have authority,"" he said.
""I think this is one of those things that are very important when dealing with our soldiers. Because we have to respect them. Everybody's time is important.""
For the same reason, he also completes his yearly individual physical fitness test (IPPT) - achieving a silver award - even though he does not need to.
""I think fitness should be an extension of our lifestyle; it shouldn't be just to pass the IPPT,"" he said.
""That's what I tell my soldiers too. If you keep yourself healthy, you will have less problems downstream.""

Because of his fitness, some servicemen in his units often mistake him for being a former regular. This would go on for a week before they asked him why he left the force. When he said he was never a regular, they could not believe it.
""Because, very rarely you find people at this rank who was never a regular before,"" he said, laughing and calling himself a ""regular NSman"".
""But I think generally they're more receptive in that sense when they're dealing with another NSman, because they know that you share the same experiences - you work, you come here and serve.""
When asked why he did not consider signing on as a regular, 1WO (NS) Surindranath conceded that despite his ""positive"" experience as an NSF, he made a decision to prioritise his studies and family.
He now has a Bachelor of Arts (Merit) in English with Business from the Singapore University of Social Sciences.
""At that time, it was difficult to juggle the career and study at the same time, especially in the armed forces because it's a 24/7 job,"" he said.
""I have a lot of respect for regulars because it's not easy. They make a lot of sacrifices for their family. And when you're studying sometimes you have to work at night, sometimes irregular hours ... It would not have been easy at that time.""
""WHY NOT ME?""
1WO (NS) Surindranath said he sees himself volunteering for about two to three years more, before someone takes over his appointment with enough runway to get used to the job.
""Frankly, nobody should stay there forever, because it will stop our succession pipeline,"" he said.
1WO (NS) Surindranath said he has no regrets about extending his ICT commitments, stressing that he was interested in each role he took over and how he could contribute effectively.
""I didn't want to go in and sit in a post for the sake of sitting in it and feeling or looking important. I think what is very important is that you went in and you tried to improve things (for your successor),"" he added.
""Defending our country is everyone’s responsibility and a way of showing our gratitude to the nation. In serving NS, instead of asking 'why me?', we should ask 'why not me?'"""

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fire-woodlands-industrial-park-recycling-waste-2945511,"SINGAPORE: A firefighter was injured while battling a blaze involving piles of waste material at a warehouse at Woodlands Industrial Park on Saturday morning (Sep 17). 
Firefighters were called to 66 Woodlands Industrial Park at about 8.40am.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said 10 emergency vehicles and about 70 firefighters were deployed.
""Upon arrival, SCDF immediately deployed its resources to surround and contain the raging fire which involved a number of piles of waste materials of various heights within the warehouse, collectively measuring about 100m by 100m, with the highest pile about 8m in height,"" it said in a Facebook post. 
""Donning their breathing apparatus sets, firefighters faced intense heat and thick black smoke while penetrating into the warehouse for firefighting operation.""

About 25 workers had evacuated before firefighters arrived at the scene. The police and SCDF evacuated about 90 people from neighbouring premises as a safety precaution.
A firefighter also injured his arm. He was assessed by a paramedic at the scene before being taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

At the height of the operation, two foam jets and two water jets, as well as an unmanned firefighting machine, were used to fight the blaze.
The fire was extinguished within three hours.
As of Saturday afternoon, SCDF said firefighters are damping down the affected area so as to prevent any potential rekindling of fire from hot burnt surfaces.
The cause of the fire is under investigation, SCDF added."
"He’s 8, has battled cancer and written a book of jokes. Now he wants to bring joy to others","Cancer survivor Aaron Tay and his younger brother Robin are donating S$1 to the Children’s Cancer Foundation for every book sold on their website until Dec 31, 2022.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cancer-survivor-singaporean-boy-joke-book-aaron-tay-fundraising-2940256,"SINGAPORE: Why did the barber win the race? Why did the boy walk slowly across the beach?
These are some of eight-year-old Aaron Tay's favourite jokes and the punchline for these and many more can be found in a book he wrote, titled 150 Jokes for Monstrously Funny Kids. The book was illustrated by his younger brother Robin and co-authored by his mother Lia Leow. 
Since publishing the book in June, the siblings have sold more than 1,500 copies, helping to raise at least S$1,500 for children with cancer and their families. They recently started their third print run of 2,000 copies.
But behind the funny one-liners is the true story of one family’s strength and resilience.
Two years ago, Aaron’s parents discovered a lump in his neck. Shortly after that, he was diagnosed with early-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. Aaron was just six years old at the time.
When the country entered its ""circuit breaker"" period in April 2020, Aaron started his first of several rounds of chemotherapy.

Speaking to CNA during a recent Zoom interview, Aaron's mother opened up about the family's experience and shared the challenges they faced during that period.
“We didn't really have time to grieve or to process our emotions,” said Ms Leow. “We just went straight into survival mode and focused on the logistics of going for checkups and treatments.”
“I was in the third trimester of my pregnancy with his baby sister and so it was difficult for us because I wasn't sure how to care for a cancer patient together with a newborn,” said the 35-year-old.
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Aaron’s father accompanied him through the course of his treatment as only one assigned caretaker was allowed.
As a result, Ms Leow had to give birth to their daughter Alexa without her husband by her side. Her daughter was also later diagnosed with Kawasaki disease but has since recovered.
“One of the things that got to me the most was that I always wondered if Aaron had lymphoma and his youngest sister had Kawasaki disease and other respiratory issues because of something that I did or didn't do,” she said, adding that the guilt had haunted her a lot.
While the eight-year-old was rather shy and did not speak much during the interview, he provided many light-hearted moments by pulling funny faces while his mother spoke or chiming in with funny puns. 
“When (Aaron) was undergoing chemotherapy, because the drugs affected his appetite a lot, it made him very nauseous ... and affected his tastebuds,” said Ms Leow.
“Taste butts!” quipped Aaron, prompting both mother and son to burst into peals of laughter.
To encourage him to eat more and maintain his weight, Ms Leow would often tell him jokes to cheer him up and distract him from the nausea.
It worked and, to her surprise, her son started coming up with his own jokes.
“They were a lot better than mine ... mine were a bit lame,” she said with a laugh.
“Throughout his treatment, he was constantly telling jokes. For him, it was a very good distraction as it gave him something to focus on,” she said. “It also helped to cheer all of us up too.”
Next to her, Aaron beams proudly as he holds up a gold trophy with two shooting stars.
“Mama, I got an award, but I don’t know what I won,” he said, giggling.
Laughing, she tells him that it was an award from the Children’s Cancer Foundation for completing his treatment.
GIVING BACK
Aaron ended his treatment in July 2020 and has been in remission for two years.
However, his love for puns and jokes remains.
“I feel like he became more cheerful and happy-go-lucky after his treatment,” said Ms Leow. “Previously, he had a hard time because we used to live in the US and when we moved back to Singapore he had quite a hard time adjusting here.”
While undergoing chemotherapy, Aaron also came up with a list of things he wanted to do after completing treatment. They include writing and publishing a book with his mother and siblings as well as helping other children with cancer.

With experience in the publishing industry, Ms Leow saw this as an opportunity to help her son realise his dreams and to give her children a project to work on.
“Aaron would come up with the jokes when we were out and about, and he would tell me to write it down on my phone so we didn't forget it,” she said.
“His younger brother Robin is very talented in art, so he helped out with the illustrations and also took charge of the aesthetics and colour scheme for our social media posts.”

When asked what he wanted to say to other children who are going through medical treatment or difficult situations like him, Aaron smiled shyly and shrugged.
“I don’t know ... I haven’t prepared that,” he said, before running away from the screen.
Later, in a WhatsApp message, Ms Leow conveyed Aaron’s message to other children: “He said it's okay to feel like giving up sometimes, because he felt that too during treatment ... 'It's okay to not be okay all the time' is one of his mottos.”
She added that her son said he tries very hard to see the funny in things, because life is much better when he does so.
The eight-year-old also hopes to come up with more jokes and fun stories to bring joy and cheer to everyone, especially children who are having a tough time.
The book costs S$7.90, excluding shipping or delivery costs, and can be purchased here. S$1 will be donated to the Children’s Cancer Foundation for every book sold until Dec 31.
So why did the barber win the race? And why did the boy walk slowly across the beach?
1. The barber knew a short cut.
2. The boy did not want to fall into quicksand.

In its fortnightly outlook, the Met Service said it expects low-level winds, as well as short thundery showers in the late morning and afternoon on most days.
There may also be widespread thundery showers and gusty winds over Singapore on a few mornings due to the development of Sumatra squalls.
But the overall rainfall for September will likely be near normal over most parts of the country, said the Met Service. 
However, it added that there could still be a few warm days despite the rainy weather, particularly in the first half.
On most days, the daily temperature is forecast to range between 24 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius, with some days reaching daily highs of about 34 degrees Celsius.
FIRST HALF OF SEPTEMBER 
The first half of September saw short thundery showers over parts of the island on some afternoons.
On a few mornings, there were widespread moderate to heavy thundery showers due to a large-scale convergence of winds over Singapore and the surrounding region.
The highest daily total rainfall for the first half of September was recorded on Sep 13 when 92.2 mm of rain fell around the West Coast Road area in the morning, said the Met Service.
The daily maximum temperature ranged from 30.7 degrees Celsius to 34.4 degrees Celsius in the first half of September, with the highest daily maximum temperature recorded at Paya Lebar on Sep 12.

Barrier-free car park system extended to Old Airport Road,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/smart-barrier-free-parking-system-old-airport-road-car-park-hdb-2943306,"SINGAPORE: Motorists using the car parks near Old Airport Road Food Centre will now enjoy a smoother parking experience following the roll-out of a smart, barrier-free system. 
Known as Parking@HDB, it was installed at the open-air car park (K7) and the multi-storey car park (KM4) at Old Airport Road earlier this week, said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in a media release on Friday (Sep 16).
The two car parks are the seventh and eighth car parks where Parking@HDB will be trialled, following the introduction of the system in six other car parks in Punggol since January 2021. 
The system was first introduced at Northshore Residences I and II in Punggol. 
SEAMLESS ENTRY AND EXIT FOR MOTORISTS
Four features will be trialled at the Old Airport Road car parks. 
With the smart parking system, gantry barriers will no longer be put up at the car park entrance and exit, as vehicle plates are registered via cameras. 
There will also be more payment options for short-term parking charges. Motorists can download the Parking@HDB app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, which will allow them to pay their parking charges via credit or debit card through the app. 
The smart parking system detects the vehicle when it enters the car park and automatically activates the parking session through the app. Parking charges will automatically be deducted when they exit the car park, and motorists do not have to manually activate the app. 
""With this, motorists need not insert their cash cards into the In-vehicle Unit, nor worry about insufficient funds,"" said HDB.
Motorists who do not have the Parking@HDB app can still continue to have their parking charges deducted from their cash card in the In-vehicle Unit.
















COLOUR-CODED LIGHTS FOR LOT AVAILABILITY
To help motorists search for parking lots, colour-coded LED indicators have been installed above every parking lot at the multi-storey car park at Old Airport Road to show lot availability.
Green indicates that the lots are available for short-term parking, while amber means the lots are reserved for season parking. Blue indicates that the lots are reserved for people with physical disabilities. 
If a motorist parks in an ""unauthorised lot"", the light indicator will turn red and flash to prompt the motorist to move the vehicle immediately. 
The indicator will be switched off for occupied lots. 
But the overhead indicators will not be installed in open-air car parks, said HDB.

Motorists who downloaded the Parking@HDB app will receive in-app notifications in real-time at the start and end of their short-term parking sessions, as well as notifications on their incurred charges. 
They will also receive an automated alert informing them to shift their vehicles if they park in an unauthorised lot. Those who do not move their vehicles will face a fine. 
Smart cameras are installed in the car park to detect motorists who park illegally, said HDB. 
Those who do not have the app installed will receive an SMS alert from HDB if their mobile numbers are updated with HDB. As for motorists who do not have the app downloaded or have their mobile numbers registered with HDB, the system will alert HDB to take enforcement action. 
""This will allow for automated enforcement around the clock to ensure more orderly parking that benefits both motorists and residents,"" said HDB.

CLOSE TO 2 MILLION TRANSACTIONS
Since the start of the smart parking system trial at Punggol Northshore in January 2021, HDB said close to 2 million parking transactions have been processed. 
Currently, 90 per cent of the feedback from motorists pertains to delays entering or exiting the car parks due to the gantry barriers.
With the system, HDB said motorists experienced at least ""16 per cent time savings"" entering and exiting the car parks as they do not have to wait for the gantry barrier to be raised, especially during peak hours. 
Among the 21,000 users of the Parking@HDB app, about 20 per cent of the motorists parking short-term at the six car parks in Punggol paid their parking charges via the app. The remaining 80 per cent paid using cashcards. 
The number of illegal parking cases have also decreased by about 60 per cent at such car parks, with the in-app alerts to remind motorists to shift their vehicles when illegal parking is detected. 
HDB said it is currently evaluating and finetuning these pilots, before progressively extending them to other car parks. 
Residents and motorists are also invited to try out the Parking@HDB experience and share with HDB their feedback to help further refine the system. 
New motorists who download and use the Parking@HDB app will enjoy free parking for their first three parking sessions at these car parks, said HDB."
Five on Friday: 5 random things about the 50-year-old Merlion,"In CNA's regular look at what hit the headlines during the week, Five on Friday shines a spotlight on Singapore's favourite half-fish, half-lion mascot as it celebrates its golden jubilee.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/five-friday-merlion-50th-birthday-6-statues-sentosa-japan-2937306,"Did you know that the Merlion at the Merlion Park turned 50 on Thursday (Sep 15)?
Singapore's foremost animal hybrid mascot, with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, has been spewing water over the Marina Bay horizon from the late 90s.
It was originally located at the mouth of the Singapore River and was unveiled on Sep 15, 1972 by the then prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. 
From lookalikes scattered throughout the island to another country's unlikely obsession with lion-fish hybrid iconography, here are five things you may not already know about the Merlion:

​​​​​​SIX AUTHORISED MERLION STATUES IN SINGAPORE
There are only six authorised merlion statues in Singapore: The original one at Merlion Park and the smaller ""Merlion cub"" located nearby, a pair that guard the entrance to a carpark along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and at Tourism Court and Mount Faber.
""But wasn't there one at Sentosa? That really big one that shoots laser from its eyes?"" you may find yourself asking.
Unfortunately, it no longer exists, having been demolished in 2019. The 37m tall behemoth no longer rules the skyline of the island.
It will be replaced by the Sentosa Sensoryscape, a two-tiered walkway with features that stimulate the five senses. Good luck on replicating the feeling of nostalgia one feels when sighting the grubby, dirt-stained exterior of the old Merlion, though.

THE MERLION IS TRADEMARKED
The likeness - and even the very mention - of the Merlion is subject to strict rules and regulations, with the Singapore Tourism Board holding several copyrights, including the Merlion symbol and the word ""Merlion"" itself.
The Merlion symbol was used by STB as its logo between 1964 and 1997, trademarking it in 1966.
Anyone who wishes to use the Merlion symbol or any representation resembling it must apply to STB for permission. 
The symbol is not permitted to be used as part of a logo, or in a manner that may cause it to be confused or associated with the applicant rather than STB or Singapore.
According to STB's website, it also cannot be used in any ""fresh food, medical product or any other product for which there may be substantial potential risk to consumers"".
Exceptions that do not require applications include products intended primarily as a souvenir, product packaging promoting Singapore as a tourist destination and collateral for a tourism event. Photography and film are also allowed, subject to STB conditions.

THE MERLION LOOKS EASTWARD
Here's a tidbit for those who believe in feng shui.
Just as it is with many of Singapore's buildings, the Merlion's placement at Merlion Park takes feng shui into consideration. 
Besides the immediate observation that the constantly flowing water from the Merlion's mouth represents an endless flow of good fortune into Singapore, the orientation of the statue has also been carefully thought through.
The Merlion is aligned to face the east, the direction that is believed to bring the greatest success.
How's that for a nice sunset view?
JAPAN REALLY, REALLY LIKES THE MERLION






      The Merliger made its debut in the webseries Ultraman: A New Power of Singapore. (Image: Youtube/ULTRAMAN OFFICIAL)
    






Lookalike Merlion statues have been spotted around the world, turning up in unlikely places including Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. 
However, no other place has caught the Merlion fever like Japan has.
Merlions have been spotted in a kimono shop in Karuizawa and in Hakodate in Hokkaido prefecture. 
The Merlion has also left an indelible mark on Japanese pop culture, showing up or being referenced in various anime and manga works, including Detective Conan, Cowboy Bebop, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and A Place Further Than The Universe, where an entire episode takes place in Singapore.
The movie My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission released in 2021 introduces a professional hero whose appearance is themed around the Merlion.
Not to be outdone, the Japanese superhero Ultraman gets some aid from the Merlion in the webseries Ultraman: A New Power of Singapore when it helps fend off a kaiju (big monster) attack on Singapore by manifesting its spirit into an armoured beast. The production was a collaboration with STB.
Why the Japanese obsession with the Merlion? Maybe because hybrid animals are a common theme for yokai, or supernatural entities in Japanese folklore - or maybe they just think that it's cute.
















MERLION 50TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS
There will be month-long events in commemoration of the Merlion turning 50.
From now until Sep 29, the Merlion statue at the Merlion Park will be illuminated in a colourful display from 6pm to 12am each day. The nearby Fullerton Hotel will also be lit in warm, golden hues.
Exclusive themed merchandise from local brands will also be made, with some available for sale at Design Orchard until Oct 4.
SingPost will also introduce an exclusive series of Singapore Mascots stamps, featuring Merli, a cartoon mascot based on the Merlion.
The Merlion will also feature in the National Gallery Singapore exhibition Nothing is Forever: Rethinking Sculpture in Singapore.
So if you are a Merlion fan, you're in for a treat.

"Man drowned after falling overboard in fishing trip, coroner urges safe boating practices","The boatman was fined S$650 for contraventions including using his boat for commercial use without a licence and for improper storage of life jackets.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-drowned-fall-overboard-fishing-trip-boatman-fined-coroner-safe-practices-2943241,"SINGAPORE: A coroner has highlighted the need for safe boating practices after a man fell overboard and drowned in the sea near Pulau Bukom during a fishing trip.
Mr Lau Kuan Tek, an IT firm operator, died in hospital aged 45 on Jan 30 last year.
State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled his death a misadventure, stressing the importance for boaters on pleasure craft to wear life jackets especially if they cannot swim or are not strong swimmers.
Boaters should also ensure that safety equipment like life jackets and life buoys are easily accessible and ready for immediate use, and ensure that they are very familiar with emergency procedures, he said.
The boatman has been fined by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for contraventions including using his pleasure craft for commercial use and failing to ensure that life buoys were easily accessible.
The court heard that Mr Lau had gone on a fishing trip with his sister's friend, named in court documents only as Madam Lily, her two sons and the boatman, named only as Mr Tan.
The boating party boarded the vessel, an open sampan-type speedboat, at the Small Boat Jetty at Pandan River on the afternoon of Jan 30, 2021.
The boatman dropped anchor at a fishing spot near Terumbu Pempang Tengah, which is near Jurong Island and next to Pulau Bukom, at about 5.30pm.
Mr Lau stood at the stern of the boat preparing bait or lures for fishing, with his back to the sea. He bent down and straightened up, but lost his balance and toppled into the sea. The boatman told Mr Lau to swim back to the boat, but Mr Lau shook his head, indicating that he could not swim.
Mdm Lily saw Mr Lau swallowing water, and shouted at the boatman to use a hook pole or fishing net pole to reach Mr Lau, but the boatman said they were too short. He held out a fishing rod and Mr Lau grabbed it, but it separated into two.
Meanwhile, Mdm Lily and her two sons were trying to release the life buoy secured to the canopy's metal poles, but they had difficulty doing so.
By the time the life buoy was released, Mr Lau had drifted about five to six metres away from the boat. Mdm Lily's two sons, aged 13 and 11, jumped into the water to retrieve Mr Lau. Together with the boatman and Mdm Lily, they managed to hoist Mr Lau back onto the boat.
However, Mr Lau had water flowing from his mouth. Mdm Lily performed chest compressions on him, assisted by the boatman, but he could not be revived.
Mr Tan moved the boat in search of help. Mdm Lily's son called 995, and the party was instructed to head to the Republic of Singapore Yacht Club.
An ambulance arrived at 6.20pm and Mr Lau was taken to hospital. He could not be revived and died about an hour later. An autopsy confirmed that he had died from drowning.
The investigating officer from MPA said the primary cause of Mr Lau's drowning was his fall overboard and his ""inability to swim"". 
The officer said Mr Lau lacked situational awareness of the hazards of the sea, resulting in him standing on his seat near the gunwale, and his sudden movement of straightening from a stooped position that caused him to lose his balance.
The officer said that the drowning may have been averted if Mr Lau had been wearing a life jacket.
However, Mr Lau's wife testified that her husband was ""an average swimmer"". She said her husband was an avid fisherman and usually carried with him an inflatable life jacket in a pouch when fishing, but he had not taken it with him that day.
CONCERNS OF THE DECEASED'S WIFE
Mr Lau's wife raised several concerns during the coroner's inquiry.
These include: That none of the passengers were offered life jackets even after Mdm Lily asked for them, that the life buoys were not easily deployable and did not have a rope attached to them, that the boatman did not jump into the sea to assist in rescuing her husband despite knowing how to swim, that there was no radio on the boat to call for assistance and the boatman did not deploy a signal flare and that the boat was not licensed to carry fare-paying passengers.
In response to the concerns of Mr Lau's wife, the MPA investigating officer stated that there was no requirement for passengers on a pleasure craft to wear life jackets. There is also no requirement for the boatman to give passengers a safety briefing before setting off, nor a requirement that skippers be proficient in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
On whether the boatman should have jumped into the sea to rescue Mr Lau, the officer stressed that ""nobody is supposed to jump (into the sea) and pick them up, that's not the way"".
The instruction for the skipper not to go into the sea to rescue a man overboard is consistent with the practice of the Red Cross of America. The mandate is to ""reach or throw, don't go"" - so that the rescuer remains safe.
After the incident, MPA gave recommendations to prevent future similar incidents. The authority recommended that boaters be encouraged to wear life jackets, especially when there was an increased risk of falling overboard.
As part of this recommendation, port inspectors on patrol were briefed on the importance of wearing life jackets and sharing this safety measure with boaters.
MPA also carried out safety briefing sessions and used case studies to inform boaters to strongly encourage passengers to wear a life jacket.
LAPSES ON THE BOAT
The boat had been equipped with the required number of life jackets and life buoys, but the life jackets were not fitted with self-igniting lights, and the location of the life jackets was not clearly marked. They were also not evenly distributed throughout the boat.
The life buoys were not marked with the boat's licence number and were not found ready for immediate use in an easily accessible position. The boat was also not equipped with a VHF radio.
The coroner said that the ideal course of events once the boatman thought Mr Lau could not swim, was to first throw a life buoy to him.
He should have then cut the anchor rope and driven the boat as close to Mr Lau as possible to rescue him.
The coroner said that what Mdm Lim's sons, aged 13 and 11, did was ""extremely brave and laudable"", but emphasised that it was also ""potentially a very hazardous risk"". 
""In these situations the primary method to save a person who is in trouble in the water, would be to throw out a flotation device, bring the boat next to the person and then pull him onto the boat, not to jump in and try to save them,"" he said.
The boatman testified that he used the boat at least six times a week for leisure fishing, and had taken his friends along with him since 2019.
He usually charged S$70 per person as he provided bait, ice, snacks, drinks and to defray the cost of petrol. He claimed that he did not realise he was not allowed to collect money from passengers that he took out.
MPA took action against the boatman for various contraventions. He paid a fine of S$500 for flouting regulations, including for failing to ensure life jackets were properly stored and life buoys were ready for immediate use. 
He was fined another S$150 for using his pleasure craft, which was only licensed for private use, for commercial purposes."
"Higher rate of workplace deaths in first half of 2022, drop in number of injuries",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mom-higher-rate-workplace-deaths-first-half-2022-injuries-workers-2942851,"SINGAPORE: A higher rate of workplace fatalities was reported in the first half of 2022, even as the number of reported workplace injuries fell, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday (Sep 16). 
There were 28 workplace deaths in the first half of the year, bringing the 6-month fatality rate per 100,000 workers to 0.8.
This was higher than the 0.4 deaths per 100,000 workers in the second half of 2021 and 0.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers in the first half of last year. A total of 14 workplace deaths were reported in the second half of last year, and 23 deaths were reported in the preceding half.
Falls from height and vehicular-related incidents made up half of the 28 deaths reported in the first six months of 2022.
""MOM is concerned with the high rate of fatality,"" said the ministry. It introduced a series of measures and called for a six-month period of heightened safety from Sep 1 to Feb 28, 2023.
A total of 10,429 workplace injuries were reported in the first half of 2022, 4.5 per cent lower compared with the second half of 2021, when 10,915 injuries were reported. 
""This was driven by a decline in the number of both major and minor injuries,"" said MOM. 
MAJOR INJURY RATE
A total of 297 major injuries were reported in the first half of 2022, compared with 294 major injuries in the second half of last year. 
The major injury rate per 100,000 workers for the first half of 2022 fell to 8.7, down from 8.9 in the second half of last year. The rate of 8.7 was lower compared with pre-COVID levels, said MOM. 
""However, major injuries are still a concern as they reflect persistent safety lapses at workplaces,"" said the Manpower Ministry. 
There were also fewer minor injuries reported in the first half of 2022, with 10,104, compared with 10,607 in the second half of last year.
Slips, trips and falls remained the leading cause of both major and minor injuries, accounting for 95 of the 297 major injuries and 2,887 of the minor injuries.

IN FOCUS: Danger zones - how workplace safety lapses are costing lives













CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST DEATHS
The construction industry accounted for the highest number of fatalities, said MOM, with 10 deaths reported in the first half of 2022 and a six-month fatality rate of 2.3 per 100,000 workers. 
It was also the biggest contributor of major injuries reported, with 84 cases and a six-month major injury rate of 19.1 per 100,000 workers. 
The Manpower Ministry said it has stepped up enforcement efforts in the construction industry. From January to mid-September, 63 stop-work orders were issued to worksites in the construction industry with unsafe conditions and practices that posed ""imminent danger"" to the workers. 
For example, a full stop-work order was issued to Wah Khiaw Developments on Aug 11. MOM found multiple unsafe practices at the worksite - workers were observed to be working at height without barricades or fall arrest systems, unsafe formworks, as well as unsafe means of access. The company was fined a total of S$15,000.

A photo provided by MOM showed a worker without a safety harness while working at the edge of the third floor of the structure.
Open sides, which are edges without barricades, were also observed at multiple locations at the worksite, said the Manpower Ministry. 
In another incident, a full stop-work order was issued to construction company KG Plasterceil on Sep 6 for multiple unsafe practices at the worksite. 
Photos provided by MOM showed toe boards and guardrails were not provided on the sides of the work platform, where workers could fall from more than 2m. 
MOM also found that workers were working on work platforms that were not closely boarded and properly secured, which may lead to the platform shifting. Some of the scaffold structures were erected on void areas, while others were placed on unstable foundations.

MOM said it is assessing the need for further penalties and the extent of such penalties for KG Plasterceil.
The unsafe work practices occurred in spite of the ministry's calls for employers and workers to ""step up"" on safety practices during the heightened safety period. 
""These companies will have to engage external auditors to conduct a thorough review of their workplace safety and health management systems, and rectify the lapses found at the worksite before MOM assesses whether to lift the stop-work order for works to resume,"" it added.
To further raise safety standards, the Manpower Ministry also introduced a new set of harmonised disqualification criteria across public sector construction tenders from Oct 1. 
This is in addition to lower thresholds for issuing demerit points to companies that are found to have breached the Workplace Safety and Health Act. 
RISE IN VEHICULAR-RELATED FATAL ACCIDENTS
The number of vehicular-related fatal accidents has been rising over the last one and a half years, said MOM, calling this a ""worrying trend"". 
Seven such accidents were reported in the first half of 2022, of which four were work-related traffic accidents. This is higher than the second half of 2021 and the preceding half.
The recent mandatory safety time-out from Sep 1 to Sep 15 targeted companies in high-risk industries with a higher number of fatalities – construction, manufacturing, marine, process, as well as transport and storage. 
The safety time-out also targeted companies in other industries that use heavy or industrial vehicles. 
""They were required to review their safety procedures, or face debarment from employing new foreign employees for one month if found to be non-compliant,"" said MOM. 
The number of dangerous occurrences, which are incidents with a high potential for multiple casualties, more than doubled from six in the second half of last year to 13 in the first half of 2022. 
This is the highest in the past three years, said MOM. Nine occurrences in the first six months of this year were due to the collapse or failure of structures and equipment, mostly in the construction industry.
""MOM calls on all stakeholders, from top management to supervisors, to workers and members of the public, to do their utmost to prevent further deaths and injuries, and build safer workplaces,"" said the ministry.

"MyRepublic ordered to pay S$60,000 for failing to protect personal data of 80,000 customers","The access key to obtain MyRepublic's customer data could be found on a publicly accessible webpage.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/myrepublic-data-breach-cyber-attack-fine-60000-2943016,"SINGAPORE: MyRepublic Singapore has been ordered to pay a financial penalty of S$60,000 for failing to protect the personal data of almost 80,000 customers in a cyber incident last year.
The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) on Thursday (Sep 15) published its decision containing the findings of its investigation into the incident.
The data breach took place on Aug 29, 2021. Local telco provider MyRepublic received an email from an external actor threatening to publish the stolen customer data unless a ransom was paid.
MyRepublic informed PDPC of the attack on Sep 1, 2021, and announced it publicly on Sep 10, 2021.
Personal data belonging to more than 75,000 Singaporeans and permanent residents was stolen during the breach, in the form of scanned copies of both sides of their NRICs and work pass cards.
Scans of residential address documents belonging to more than 4,300 foreigners, and forms from more than 3,600 customers porting over mobile services, which contained their full names and mobile numbers, were also compromised.
At the time of the incident in August 2021, MyRepublic accepted customer orders for mobile services through its mobile order portal, according to PDPC's findings.
The portal stored customers' identity verification and mobile number porting documents in a ""bucket"" on cloud storage provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The bucket was publicly accessible, but protected by an access key. Investigations found that the external actor used the access key to access the bucket.
""Fortunately, the compromised access key could not be used by the external actor to access (MyRepublic's) other AWS accounts, systems or buckets,"" said PDPC.
""However, an unusually large volume of data had been downloaded from the bucket before it was deleted.""
PDPC noted that MyRepublic controlled a high volume of sensitive personal data and should have implemented stronger security measures to protect it. It identified multiple failures by the telco to protect the access key.
According to MyRepublic, the bucket's access key could be found on a publicly accessible webpage displaying technical information used by programmers, known as ""PHP info"".
""This was a significant vulnerability as anyone who knew or could guess the php-info URL could obtain the access key and use it to access the customer data in the bucket,"" said PDPC.
The commission noted that MyRepublic had determined this was the most likely way that the external actor had obtained the access key.
Instead of leaving the access key publicly accessible, MyRepublic should have disabled the ""PHP info"" function or moved the access key to files that were only available to authorised individuals, said PDPC.
According to MyRepublic, the access key was also embedded in the source code of the mobile order portal, which was available to all of the telco's developers.
The external actor could have obtained the access key in this way, or a developer could have inadvertently disclosed it, said PDPC.
The commission also said that the access key was ""captured in the clear"" in mobile order application log files made available to employees, including external developers and engineers, who did not require such information.
Furthermore, given the high volume and sensitivity of the customer data stored in the bucket, it should not have been publicly available, added PDPC.
In deciding on the penalty, the commission said that MyRepublic took prompt and effective remedial actions, cooperated with investigations and voluntarily accepted liability.
The remedial actions included replacing the access key, removing environment configuration files that exposed the access key and restricting access to buckets to specific IP addresses.
MyRepublic notified affected customers and recommended actions to minimise the risk of identity fraud and social engineering, said PDPC. It also offered affected customers six months of complimentary credit monitoring services.
The telco also conducted a month of dark web monitoring until Oct 3, 2021, to verify whether the stolen data was published."
The Online Citizen reactivates website and social media accounts; editor Terry Xu relocating to Taiwan,"The Online Citizen's licence was cancelled by IMDA in October 2021.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/online-citizen-website-facebook-instagram-reactivated-editor-terry-xu-relocate-taiwan-2942936,"SINGAPORE: The Online Citizen reactivated its website and social media accounts on Friday (Sep 16), with its editor Terry Xu saying he is ""relocating"" to Taiwan.
The alternative news website and social media accounts went offline in September last year, after the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) suspended its licence for repeatedly failing to declare all of its funding sources. 
The licence was cancelled by IMDA in October last year.
On Friday, Mr Xu posted on reactivated Facebook page and on its website. He said that he was relocating to Taiwan to ""start up a news media outlet which will provide daily news coverage in Asia"".
He wrote: ""Both the operation of the website along with its social media platforms have been transferred to a new company that is registered in Taiwan while the old Singapore entity is in the midst of closure.""
The editor added that there will be no daily news coverage from TOC as the website will be focused on providing commentaries and analysis on current affairs in Asia. He said more details will be announced ""in due course"".
Responding to CNA’s queries, IMDA said: ""The Online Citizen’s class licence was cancelled as it had repeatedly refused to comply with the requirement to declare its funding sources, including foreign funding.
“IMDA is aware of the new foreign-based website and social media accounts.""
""The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) and the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) will continue to apply,"" it added.

"Man carried off sleeping sex worker in Geylang for 'forced illicit intercourse', gets jail and caning","The man had gone to Geylang to look for sex but could not find a ""suitable"" sex worker as he felt the prices were too high, said the prosecution.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jail-caning-abducting-woman-geylang-lane-sex-worker-court-2942921,"SINGAPORE: A man who was looking for sex in Geylang thought the prices were too high and decided to target a woman who was sleeping by the road. 
He molested her while she was drowsy from taking some pills, before carrying her to a more secluded lane where he forced sex on her.
The woman, who was a sex worker, lodged a police report later that morning.
Patian Sohag, 40, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years' jail and three strokes of the cane on Friday (Sep 16).
The court heard that Patian worked at a chemical plating factory. On Feb 28 last year, he had alcohol with his friends from 10pm.
At about 2am on Mar 1, 2021, Patian went to Geylang with a friend intending to look for sex workers.
""However, he was unable to find a suitable one as he felt that the prices quoted were too high,"" said the prosecutor.
Patian's friend left as he had to work, and Patian continued roaming the Geylang area for sex workers.
At about 3.20am, he came across the victim, a 53-year-old woman who plied her trade in Geylang. Earlier that night, she had gone to a coffee shop in Lorong 10 and consumed ""power pills"" as they made her feel alert.
She fell asleep on a chair in Geylang Lorong 20 from 12.15am.
When Patian saw the sleeping woman, he checked that no one else was around before walking towards her as he wanted to have sex with her.
He tried to wake her up by calling to her, but the victim did not respond and was in a deep sleep. 
Patian then molested her a few times, trying to wake her up in the process, but she did not respond.
He asked her if she wanted to go with him to have sex, but the victim did not respond. Patian then decided to take her to a secluded connected lane nearby where there were potted plants so he could have sex with her there, said the prosecutor.
He then lifted the victim up by her armpits and carried her to the lane, where he placed her on the ground and had sex with her, said the prosecutor.
Patian left about six minutes later, and the victim staggered back to the chair she had been sitting on and resumed sleeping.
Later that morning, she woke up and found a sticky substance on her underwear. Believing it was semen, the Singaporean woman lodged a police report, saying her phone had also been taken.
A toxicology report of the victim's blood and urine samples found elevated levels of a cough suppressant and sedative in the victim. The levels of dextromethorphan and nitrazepam in her blood sample ranged from about three to five times the upper ends of their therapeutic ranges, court documents said.
Side effects of such levels of both drugs include hallucination, altered mental status, amnesia, confusion, sedation and disorientation.
Patian's semen was found on the victim's vaginal swabs, and he was arrested on Mar 4, 2021.
His acts of groping the victim while she was asleep on the chair were caught on closed-circuit television footage, which was played in court. The footage ended when Patian carried the woman off into the area with the potted plants. 
Patian's case was originally in the High Court but was downgraded to the State Courts. The Bangladesh national pleaded guilty to reclassified charges on Friday: One count of abduction for forced illicit intercourse and one count of criminal force to outrage the victim's modesty. A third charge of misappropriation was considered in sentencing.
""BRAZEN"": PROSECUTOR
Deputy Public Prosecutor Delicia Tan asked for a jail term of between three years and four years and two months' jail, with three strokes of the cane.
She said Patian ""had his way with the victim"" and ""brazenly molested her"". 
Defence lawyer Ashwin Ganapathy said it would be naive of him to ask for a lenient sentence, given how egregious the case was.
""What I seek is a proportionate sentence,"" he said, asking for the sentences to run concurrently instead of consecutively as the prosecution was asking for.
He said he accepted that the victim was vulnerable as she was intoxicated on the drugs.
""I would go as far as to say her vulnerability is amplified, because she's a sex worker, and sex workers are far more vulnerable because of their reluctance to come forward,"" he said.
Mr Ganapathy asked for three years' jail and three strokes of the cane. He said his client has worked in Singapore in manufacturing for the past 16 years and supported his elderly parents on his own.
District Judge Ronald Gwee in sentencing commended the defence lawyer for his approach, which he said was ""very balanced and very fair to both accused and victim"".
For abduction for forced illicit intercourse, Patian could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned."
1 in 5 Ang Mo Kio SERS households have applied for new flats: HDB,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ang-mo-kio-sers-bto-exercise-hdb-flats-2942866,"SINGAPORE: About 20 per cent of Ang Mo Kio households whose blocks are due for redevelopment have applied for a new flat in May and August sales exercises, said the Housing & Development Board (HDB) on Friday (Sep 16).
In April, residents at Blocks 562 to 565 at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 were informed that their blocks had been selected for the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).
SERS, introduced in 1995, is part of the Government’s efforts to renew older housing estates. Under the scheme, residents are offered new homes nearby, while the old site will be redeveloped.
Besides buying a new flat at the designated replacement site, SERS flat owners can also take part in HDB’s Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises, buy a flat from HDB’s open booking of flats, or buy a resale flat from the open market, said HDB.
Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 SERS flat owners could apply for seven BTO projects launched in May and August with their SERS rehousing benefits and were given priority for allocation, with 10 per cent of the flat supply set aside for them.
The seven projects were Lakeside View, Yishun Beacon, and Kim Keat Heights, offered during the May BTO exercise, and Central Weave @ AMK, Keat Hong Grange, Woodlands South Plains and Sun Plaza Spring launched in the August exercise.

To date, 117 out of 606 Ang Mo Kio SERS households have applied for a new flat in either the May or August 2022 BTO or SBF exercises, HDB said on Friday in response to media queries.
Among these households, 107 households applied for a BTO flat across six of the seven projects, with the exception of Keat Hong Grange. 
Ten households applied for an SBF flat, which includes unsold units from past BTO launches, surplus flats from SERS projects and any flats repurchased by HDB.
Of the 94 households that applied for a flat in the August BTO exercise, 85 applied for a flat in Central Weave @ AMK.
""About nine in 10 applicants fall within the 10 per cent priority allocation quota, which means a vast majority of the Ang Mo Kio SERS households will be successful in their applications,"" said HDB.
Besides Central Weave at AMK, applications also exceeded the number of units set aside for SERS applicants at Woodlands South Plains.
But HDB said that those who are not balloted within the 10 per cent priority quota will get another chance of being balloted together with the public applicants.
Balloting is ongoing, and HDB will inform applicants of the ballot results at the end of September. 
SERS households who are not successful in the ballot can still apply for new flats elsewhere in subsequent BTO and SBF exercises or open booking, said HDB. They also have the option of taking up a new flat at their designated site, or buying a resale flat.
""HDB will continue to provide personalised support for all SERS households and guide them on the available rehousing options, so that they can choose one that best suits their needs and budget,"" the Housing Board said."
Living the plant-based life: Growing appetite for vegan food in Singapore,"It's not as hard to adopt a vegan diet now compared to before, with more options, awareness and support, says an organisation that helps people who want to cut back on meat.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vegan-plant-based-food-growing-market-2899661,"SINGAPORE: For years, Mr Yuan Oeij considered himself a fan of popular local dishes like chicken rice, bak kut teh and beef hor fun.
But these dishes don’t appeal to him anymore. The owner of restaurant chain Prive Group completely stopped eating meat and animal-derived products in 2019 and has not looked back since. 
His journey was a gradual one. He first considered opting for a vegan diet 10 years ago when he learnt of the cruelty involved in the production of meat, Mr Oeij said.
“It was only 2018 that I finally decided to take steps towards matching my habits with my beliefs, which were incongruent for quite a while,” he told CNA. 
He went about it one food category at a time, first removing mammals and dairy from his diet, then chicken and eggs, then seafood.
Now, when he needs a taste of the past, he whips up a plant-based equivalent or has a meal at his restaurants, where he introduced a vegan-friendly menu in 2015.
But he doesn’t miss the actual meat-laden dishes anymore, as it is not in his psyche to want to eat meat, said Mr Oeij.
“You don’t focus on what you’ve lost. You focus on what you’ve gained,” he said, adding that he now finds he has more energy, falls sick less and is happier.
Mr Oeij is part of a growing group of people in Singapore who are ditching animal meat and products.

MORE OPTING FOR PLANT-BASED FOOD
In the last few years, more people are trying plant-based food and cutting down on their meat intake, said Ms Bianca Polak, secretary at the Centre for a Responsible Future.
“More people are becoming aware of veganism and the benefits of a plant-based diet and lifestyle on the environment, health and animals,” she said.
The Singapore-based centre, a non-profit organisation set up in 1999, promotes plant-based food with an aim of supporting people who want to change their eating habits.
Among the reasons behind the shift towards a vegan diet is an increased awareness of how the meat industry contributes to the “destruction” of the planet, she said.
“There is also more awareness of the cruelty in the meat and dairy industry as well as the seafood industry.”
The younger generation is especially affected by this and many decide to adopt a vegan diet after watching documentaries, she said.
The growing market for plant-based alternatives can be seen in the expansion of Impossible Foods, which sells products like “beef” and “pork” made with plant-based products.
Its products are now sold in more than 700 restaurants in Singapore, an almost 300 per cent growth since January 2020, said Mr Laurent Stevenart, the firm’s general manager for Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
According to numbers published by abillion, a Singapore-based app which members can use to discover vegan food and vegan and cruelty-free products, the average number of vegan dishes per restaurant here rose from 2.3 in the second quarter of 2019 to 4.3 in the second quarter of 2020.
While access and price may have been barriers for people turning to the diet in the past, it is not difficult anymore to adopt a vegan diet in Singapore, said Ms Polak, a vegan herself.

IN FOCUS: Will changing what we eat help save the planet?



















Meet the restaurateur creating plant-based versions of Singaporean food













There are communities on social media for support, more awareness on the dietary option and more eateries and supermarkets offering plant-based options, she said.
MORE BUSINESSES OFFERING VEGAN FOOD
Among the businesses catering to the increasing number of people looking for alternatives to meat and animal-derived products is Everyday Vegan Grocer.
The supermarket, which also has a deli, opened in November 2020 and currently occupies a two-storey shophouse on Haji Lane.
Owner Amanda Lee said she started it so people could shop for vegan products without having to go through the tedious process of checking ingredients in traditional shops. 
Sometimes they may discover a possible animal-based ingredient in the products when they get home from shopping and feel disappointed with themselves, she said. 
""That's why most people actually fall off the bandwagon. They feel that there are so many things to think about … it shouldn't be so difficult,"" she said. 
The 34-year-old is familiar with these issues. She started her journey into veganism about 10 years ago, taking two to three years to completely stop eating animal-derived items.
She wanted to give people the kind of access to vegan options and prices that she didn't have during her journey, she said. 
For instance, among the offerings at the store are vegan burgers that cost S$5.
“We wanted a food menu that would appeal to everyone taste-wise and price-wise, so everyone can try vegan and choose kindness. Even if it's just one meal a week,” she said. 
Big companies have also taken to catering to vegans. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean International and airline Emirates, for instance, offer vegan menus.
In July this year, Emirates started offering vegan options in its inflight menu for outbound flights from Singapore and in August, did the same for inbound flights to Singapore. 
“Demand for plant-based food offerings on our airlines has increased significantly in the last decade,” said Mr Rashid Al Ardha, the carrier’s country manager for Singapore and Brunei.
He noted that there is a particular increase in demand during Veganuary, a global movement encouraging a vegan diet that runs in January every year. 
In 2021, Emirates served up to 10 per cent more vegan meals across all its flights in January than in other months. 
The demand for vegan food on its ships has been increasing, said Royal Caribbean International’s food and beverage director Francis Dias. 
It serves about 90 vegan meals a day in the main dining room of Spectrum of the Seas, which is currently home-ported in Singapore. The dining room seats more than 1,800 guests.
In comparison, when the firm first rolled out its vegan offerings in 2019, there were just ""a few orders"" for vegan dishes in a day, he said.

IS VEGAN FOOD BETTER?
Health-wise, a minimally processed vegan diet is high in fibre from vegetables, whole grains and fruits, and lower in total calories and saturated fat due to the removal of animal fats from the diet, said senior dietician at Mount Elizabeth Hospital Diane Seto.
“As such, a vegan diet is effective in reducing body weight, body mass index and waist circumference in both healthy individuals and individuals with diabetes and heart disease,” she said.
However these health effects are only conferred with a high intake of whole, plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans.
“Not all vegan diets are healthy. A vegan diet that includes predominantly processed or deep-fried foods, or is high in fat and refined sugar, is not healthy,” Ms Seto said.
She also cautioned that vegan food can lack key nutrients such as protein, calcium, iron and Vitamin B12.
“This is because many of these nutrients are found primarily or only in animal sources,” she said, giving the example of Vitamin B12 which is found only in foods like egg, dairy, fish and meat.
Proper planning of the diet is essential in ensuring that the diet is nutritionally adequate, balanced and varied.
Omnivorous plant-rich diets such as the Mediterranean diet, flexitarian and pescetarian diets which include moderate amounts of lean animal proteins have similar health benefits to a vegan diet, Ms Seto said.

A Nanyang Technological University professor said people cutting back on meat have a ""great impact on mitigating climate change"".
“Animal farming, some of it, not all, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, so if we can do away with animal farming, it’s really beneficial for the environment,” said Professor William Chen, director of the university's Food Science and Technology Programme.
Results from a Singapore-centric study published in 2019 which looked at the environmental impact of food items illustrated the difference between meat and vegetables.
The annual greenhouse gas emissions per capita with carbon dioxide equivalent as a unit of measurement for pork was 266kg, compared to 6kg for leafy vegetables like spinach, lettuce and Chinese cabbage, according to the study commissioned by investment firm Temasek and carried out by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Deloitte.
However, Prof Chen said crop farming is not entirely green as it still relies on land, water and energy for transportation. Subsequent processing of plant-based protein foods to suit consumer demand also needs energy, he added.
Nevertheless, he said: “Having a variety of diet options with more plant-based foods would certainly help to protect the environment.”"
"Moderna's bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to arrive by end-September, Pfizer's shot being evaluated: Ong Ye Kung",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moderna-bivalent-covid-19-vaccine-september-pfizer-evaluating-ong-ye-kung-2941131,"SINGAPORE: Shipments of the bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are expected to arrive in Singapore by the end of September, with authorities currently evaluating the one made by Pfizer.
This was shared by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Sep 15), in a video posted on his Instagram and TikTok accounts.
""By then, we will finalise the arrangements and we will announce to the public,"" he said.
The Health Sciences Authority granted interim authorisation for the Moderna bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a booster shot on Wednesday, making it the first of such vaccine in Singapore. 
Under the Pandemic Special Access Route, it was authorised for use as a single-dose booster in individuals aged 18 and above, who have received their primary series COVID-19 vaccination.

Singapore grants interim authorisation for first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine













Unlike the COVID-19 vaccines used so far here, which target only the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, the updated Moderna vaccine also targets the Omicron BA.1 variant of the virus.
Earlier on Thursday, Moderna’s senior vice-president of commercial vaccines Patrick Bergstedt said the company hopes to have “hundreds of thousands of doses available in Singapore before the end of the month”."

Passengers departing from Changi Airport to pay higher fees and levies from Nov 1
From Nov 1, passengers flying out of Changi Airport will have to pay more in airport fees and levies.
Travellers on flights departing from Changi Airport currently pay a total of S$52.30.
For tickets issued from Nov 1 to Mar 31 next year, the amount will go up to a total of S$59.20. The fees will subsequently go up again in phases from April next year.
The planned increases were announced in 2018, but were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Passengers whose air tickets are issued before Nov 1, 2022 will not pay the higher fees and levies.
Typhoon Muifa lashes eastern China, forcing 1.6 million from their homes
Typhoon Muifa, lashing China's densely populated east coast, has forced around 1.6 million people to leave their homes and grounded most flights at Shanghai's main airports. There were no immediate reports of any deaths or casualties.
Muifa is the strongest tropical cyclone to hit Shanghai since records began in 1949.
It was downgraded to a strong tropical storm by Chinese weather forecasters on Thursday, but will bring heavy rains and flash flooding across several provinces as it moves north across populated coastal provinces.
The storm came soon after Typhoon Hinnamnoor hit Shanghai and its neighbouring region last week, and is the 12th typhoon to hit China this year.
Penang, Selangor revoke state titles awarded to former Malaysian PM Najib
Penang has followed in the footsteps of Selangor by revoking a title previously bestowed on former prime minister Najib Razak. The state government agreed to revoke a title Najib received in 2009 in light of his conviction in the SRC International case.
His title of Dato’ Seri Utama was revoked effective Thursday (Sep 15).
On Monday, Selangor's sultan stripped titles bestowed to Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor.
When throwing things away becomes hard: Why people hoard
Say “hoarder” and images of stacked newspapers and boxes, little space to move, and in some cases, scurrying cockroaches come to mind. Decluttering them, however, does not mean entirely ridding them of unwanted items.

New bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine doses expected to be available in Singapore by end-Sep: Moderna,"Over time, the original vaccine will no longer be available, Moderna said.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moderna-bivalent-covid-19-vaccine-booster-expected-available-end-september-2940001,"SINGAPORE: Moderna’s new bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine is expected to be available in Singapore by end of this month.
“We hope to have hundreds of thousands of doses available in Singapore before the end of the month,” the pharmaceutical firm’s senior vice president of commercial vaccines Patrick Bergstedt told CNA on Wednesday (Sep 14).
His comments came after the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) announced that it granted interim authorisation for Moderna’s Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron jab, the first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine in the country.
Official vaccination recommendations using this booster will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in due time, HSA said.
Moderna, which set up a subsidiary in Singapore to support the delivery of mRNA vaccines, is transferring all its manufacturing capacity over to the new updated vaccine, Mr Bergstedt added.
“Over time, the original vaccine will no longer be available. It will be replaced by this new updated bivalent vaccine,” he said.
He gave assurance that Moderna’s original COVID-19 vaccine continues to offer protection, but noted that the level of protection wanes.
“Because it was not specifically designed against the Omicron variant, that level of protection is not going to be as durable, as broad, as what the new updated vaccine provides,” he said.
The newly approved booster vaccine contains the original COVID-19 virus and the BA.1 Omicron variant, but Moderna is already in “very advanced” stages of the next vaccine, he said.
The upcoming vaccine will contain Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 – which led to a recent COVID-19 wave in the country – and the original virus, he said.
“The timing and availability of that vaccine will depend very much on the regulatory authorisation in Singapore,” he said.
Singapore will also be bringing in the bivalent vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier this week. 
EVOLVING VACCINES
Infectious diseases specialist at Farrer Park Hospital, Dr Loh Jiashen, said that there is a possibility that COVID-19 vaccines may evolve to target more than one variant.
“If variants of great impact emerge, I think vaccine companies may potentially go in that direction and subsequent vaccines may be even more than two-valent,” he said.

CNA Explains: What is a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, and how will it protect me?













Omicron has had a wide global sweeping impact and hence there was a specific vaccine targeted against it, he noted.
He added, however, that such vaccines are not new, giving the example of the influenza vaccine, which is updated twice a year.
“We may potentially … reach a stage like an influenza vaccine where the most updated circulating variants are the ones in the vaccine. Certainly, that would be a viable strategy,” he said.
The challenge would be for the pharmaceutical companies to ramp up production to keep up with such updates, he said.
CURRENT COVID-19 SITUATION
Dr Asok Kurup, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital who spoke on CNA938’s Asia First, said that those who are at lower risk may want to wait for the approved bivalent booster.
“If you're the highest risk individual and time is ticking, you need to be protected as soon as possible, go for whatever is on hand. You don't have to wait for this,” he said.
Dr Kurup gave an overview of the current COVID-19 situation in Singapore.
While COVID-19 continues to be a “clear and present danger”, the general public is quite well protected against COVID-19 with the safeguards in place and “don’t have to be too alarmed”, he said.
“I think we have ringfenced it to those who are mostly immune compromised,” he said.
“We have to get to know who are those in our neighbourhood, our friends and family who are immune compromised to make sure they are protected because the vulnerable are the ones who truly have … the raw end of the stick and we have to do whatever we can to protect them.”

Passengers departing from Changi Airport to pay higher fees and levies from Nov 1,"Among the charges, the aviation levy will be increased for the first time in 13 years.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-airport-fees-levies-charges-departing-passengers-nov-1-phased-increase-2940366,"SINGAPORE: Passengers flying out of Changi Airport will have to pay more in airport fees and levies from Nov 1 as the aviation industry continues to recover after the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Travellers on flights departing from Changi Airport currently pay a fee of S$52.30 - comprising S$35.40 in passenger service and security fee (PSSF), S$6.10 in aviation levy and S$10.80 in airport development levy. 
From Nov 1 to Mar 31 next year, the amount will go up to a total of S$59.20. That's after the passenger service and security fee increases to S$40.40 and the aviation levy rises to S$8.
The passenger service and security fee will subsequently go up again in phases from Apr 1, 2023, and Apr 1, 2024.
Announcing the charges on Thursday (Sep 15), the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) noted that planned increases were announced in 2018, but they were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 






      Summary of charges payable by passengers at Changi Airport from Nov 1, 2022. (Table: CAAS/Changi Airport Group)
    






This would be the first adjustment to the aviation levy, which was introduced 13 years ago in 2009.
The aviation levy funds air hub development and regulatory functions of CAAS, authorities noted in a media release, adding that the aviation regulator's functions are expected to grow as it works to rebuild Singapore’s position as a global air hub post-pandemic.
Passengers whose air tickets were issued before Nov 1, 2022, will not pay the higher fees and levies.
""The Landing, Parking and Aerobridge (LPA) charges for all flights operating at Changi Airport will increase by 2 per cent on Nov 1, 2022, and increase by another 1 per cent each year on Apr 1, 2023, and Apr 1, 2024, as earlier announced,"" said the authorities.
""In addition to supporting CAG’s operations, the PSSF and LPA charges also go towards development plans and infrastructure upgrading of existing terminals which had continued throughout the pandemic.""
Amid the travel recovery, Changi Airport has reopened two terminals which had been closed since May 2020.
Terminal 4 resumed operations on Sep 13, while Terminal 2, which was closed for renovation works, started reopening in phases from May 29.
Work will also resume on Changi Airport Terminal 5 after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic.

New private home sales fall 47.6% in August amid lack of launches during Hungry Ghost month,"This is the lowest monthly sales since April 2020 when showrooms were closed during the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"".
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-private-home-sales-developers-august-2022-ura-2940131,"SINGAPORE: New private home sales in Singapore fell 47.6 per cent in August from a month earlier due to the lack of launches during the Hungry Ghost month.
Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers sold 437 units last month, down from 834 units in July, according to figures released on Thursday (Sep 15) by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
The last time monthly sales were lower was in April 2020 - when the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" period had just started - when 277 new homes were sold.
On a year-on-year basis, home sales in August fell 64.1 per cent from the 1,216 units sold in the same period last year.
No new condominium projects were launched last month.  
However, two landed projects were launched - The Jardine Residences (six units) along Lorong Chuan and Mount Rosie Signature Collection (six units) near the Bukit Timah area.
""The Lunar Seventh Month, which straddled almost the whole month of August, resulted in developers deferring the launch of new projects,"" noted Mr Lee Sze Teck, Huttons Asia's senior director for research.
""The number of units launched for sale fell by 66.7 per cent month-on-month to 134. This is the lowest number of units launched for sale since September 2017.""
The Core Central Region (CCR) saw the most number of units sold at 220, followed by the Rest of Central Region (RCR) at 127 units and the Outside Central Region (OCR) at 90 units.
This is the first time that units in CCR have exceeded 50 per cent of monthly sales, noted Mr Lee.
""Buyers are shifting their focus to the CCR as the median price per sq ft between the CCR and RCR has narrowed to 14.9 per cent in August 2022 compared to 41.6 per cent in January 2022,"" he added.
Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Property Services, added that the increase in sales in the CCR was likely due to the lack of new projects launched in the area, ""leading to buyers and investors scraping the barrel for a limited pool of private homes"".
Due to the lack of new launches in August, buyers looked to past projects. Some of the best-selling ones include Hyll On Holland, Riviere, Perfect Ten and The Hyde.
MORE PURCHASES BY FOREIGNERS
Property analysts also noted that there were more purchases by foreigners.
The number of condominiums, excluding ECs, bought by foreigners rose from 42 units in July to 59 units in August, noted Ms Christin Sun, OrangeTee and Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics.
She added that last month, 64.4 per cent of foreigners bought private condominiums in the CCR (38 units), followed by 13 transactions in the RCR and eight in the OCR. 
""With visitor arrivals on track to return to pre-pandemic levels, it is no surprise that foreigner purchases are moving in tandem,"" said Mr Mohan.
""Singapore's status as a secure regional hub and the nation's quick shift to endemic living has also given the country a competitive advantage. The easing of border control measures gives visitors from abroad a sense of security and assurance.""
Moving forward, property analysts expect sales to pick up.
Ms Sun said that rising interest rates and inflation ""do not seem to have a significant impact on the property market"".
""Sales volume will likely rebound next month as at least two projects are launched in September including Sky Eden@Bedok and the highly anticipated integrated development, Lentor Modern,"" she added.
Ms Sun noted reports that 75 per cent or 118 units of Sky Eden@Bedok were sold on the first day of the project's launch, at an average price of about S$2,100 psf. Units at another popular project, Amo Residence, sold at a median price of S$2,110 psf when they were launched in July.
""Even at higher price points, units are being snapped up in these two projects,"" she said.
""Their successful launches testify that affordability is not an issue for some buyers and people are willing to pay for projects with good locations and attractive product attributes.""

Man charged with causing death of ACS(I) student during high-element rope course at SAFRA Yishun,"The 15-year-old student died from multi-organ failure and traumatic asphyxia following the incident during an ACS (Independent) camp programme in February 2021.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-charged-cause-death-acsi-student-safra-yishun-rope-course-2940181,"SINGAPORE: A man has been charged in relation to the death of a 15-year-old student who died in February last year after an incident during a school camp.
Muhammad Nurul Hakim Mohamed Din, 22, was handed one charge on Thursday (Sep 15) for causing the death of 15-year-old Puah Xin Yang Jethro at about 1.25pm on Feb 3, 2021, at the SAFRA Adventure Sports Centre in Yishun.
According to his charge, he committed a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide by illegally omitting to ensure that both of the leg straps of Jethro's safety harness were properly buckled and adjusted before dispatching Jethro onto the rope course.
As a result, Jethro died from multi-organ failure following compression of his neck, and traumatic asphyxia. According to the charge sheet, Jethro was suspended in the loose harness after he fell off the rope course and his leg straps became completely unbuckled.
Muhammad Nurul Hakim was the dispatcher of the Canopy Sky Walk rope course at the time. Past reports state that the activity was organised by outdoor adventure learning company Camelot.
The accused, who did not make any indication of how he would plead, is defended by lawyer Azri Imran Tan. Mr Tan asked for bail and time to take instructions from his client.
In a statement in February last year, SAFRA Yishun described the incident as a ""mishap"" and said that the student was part of an ACS (Independent) camp programme.
The police previously said that Jethro had lost his footing while participating in the high-element course, but was ""suspended by the safety harness and subsequently lost consciousness when he was lowered to the ground"".
The boy was unresponsive when paramedics arrived and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He died in hospital the next day.
The Ministry of Education (MOE) and ACS(I) said in a joint statement after the incident that they were greatly saddened by the student's passing.
After the incident, all schools suspended outdoor activities involving high elements.
In response to CNA's queries on Thursday, MOE said that all height-based outdoor adventure learning activities remain suspended. 
 
""MOE will look into developments related to the case, before working towards a resumption of height-based outdoor adventure learning activities,"" it said, adding that more details will be announced when ready.
If convicted of causing death by a rash act, the accused could be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.
He was offered bail of S$10,000 and will return to court next month."
"Man used friend's S$25,000 bitcoin investment to cheat woman in failed money exchange scam",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-used-friends-bitcoin-investment-cheat-woman-spf-database-illegal-access-court-2940091,"SINGAPORE: In order to commit a money exchange scam, a man used his friend's S$25,000 meant for bitcoin investment and roped in other friends to cheat a woman of 400,000 yuan (S$80,700).
However, his friends failed in the scam when they tried to escape by bus and the victim caught up with them in a taxi.
When the police were conducting their investigations, Lincoln Poh Chong Tee turned off his phone and hid it in a shoe rack outside his home, knowing it contained incriminating evidence. 
And in a separate incident, he took a knife to confront a man who was having drinks with his girlfriend and was eventually remanded in May this year.
For his offences, Poh, 26, was sentenced to a year's jail on Thursday (Sep 15).
He pleaded guilty to five charges of conspiring to cheat, obstructing the course of justice, dishonest misappropriation, possessing a weapon unlawfully and abetting unauthorised access to the Singapore Police Force's database. 
The court heard that Poh hatched a plot with his friend Wang Yu Chi sometime around October 2020 to scam others through a fake money exchange service.
They planned to get the victim to transfer money to them and lie to the victim that they did not receive the cash. After this, they intended to promise a refund and abort the deal but keep the victim's foreign currency.
Wang convinced a 33-year-old woman to exchange S$150,000 worth of yuan. Poh's role was to prepare S$150,000 in cash as a prop, but he never intended to hand the cash to the customer. The sum included his own savings, his girlfriend's contributions and sums of money his friends entrusted to him to invest in Bitcoin.
Poh was to get 20 per cent of the gains from the scam, or about S$30,000. He also roped in other friends to help out.
On Oct 21, 2020, two of Poh's friends who agreed to take part in the scam went to meet the victim in Claymore Road. The victim was with her husband and counted the prop money of S$150,000 the scammers brought with them.
After counting it, she transferred 400,000 yuan - roughly half the total agreed amount - to two bank accounts as instructed. Wanting security that the exchange would go through, the victim asked for the cash equivalent for the 400,000 yuan.
VICTIM CAUGHT UP WITH SCAMMERS
The scammers did not want to hand over any cash and asked the victim to transfer the other half of the sum, but she refused. The scammers then tried to flee on a bus, but the victim boarded a Grab taxi and caught up with them. 
Her husband called the police, who arrested Poh's two friends and seized the S$150,000 in cash. Poh and Wang were identified through police investigations and subsequently arrested.
Before his arrest, Poh switched off and concealed his phone inside a shoe rack outside his family home, knowing that the device contained incriminating evidence.
He lied to the police repeatedly that he had lost his phone. He later changed his lie by saying he had given the phone to his girlfriend, and police officers performed a futile search in her room.
It was only in early November 2020 that Poh admitted he had been lying and that he had hidden the phone outside his house.
The S$150,000 he had consisted of various sums including money that Poh's friends entrusted to him to invest in Bitcoin.
POLICE OFFICER'S UNAUTHORISED SCREENING 
One of these friends was Bryan Tay Wei Chuan, 29, a ground response force officer of the Singapore Police Force at Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre, with the rank of Sergeant Grade 2.
He got to know Poh during a holiday in Vietnam, and the pair became friends and travelled together.
After they returned to Singapore, they kept in touch and would visit spas together.
In March 2020, Poh texted Tay and asked him to help him with something. He passed Tay the NRIC number belonging to his friend Wang and asked him to check if there was any ongoing case.
Poh told Tay that Wang had been falsely implicated in a pending investigation. Tay told him that he would get in trouble if he was caught performing an unauthorised screening, but Poh kept asking him to do it.
About a week later, Tay was performing his duties at Sembawang neighbourhood police centre when he saw that there was no one else around. He screened Wang's NRIC number and sent the screening of Wang's criminal records to Poh via WhatsApp.
Poh asked Tay to conduct another screening in April 2020, but Tay refused, saying that there were records of such screenings and he would get caught. 
Poh tried again in July 2020, asking Tay to check if Wang was wanted by the authorities in order for him to determine if he could return to Singapore. Tay refused, saying he did not dare to make any more checks.
Sometime in September 2020, Poh told Tay he had a profitable opportunity in Bitcoin and promised him profits.
Convinced after Poh showed him rising bitcoin prices and Google searches on Bitcoin, Tay transferred Poh S$25,000 for investment.
Instead of investing it on Tay's behalf, Poh used the sum as part of the S$150,000 ""prop"" money for the money exchange scam.
In November 2020, a police officer lodged a report about Tay's unauthorised screening of Wang's NRIC number, saying it had been uncovered by investigations against Poh.
When investigations were ongoing for the above crimes, Poh took a knife to confront a man who was drinking with his girlfriend.
Poh had been drinking in May 2022 when he called his girlfriend, who was at a bar. Poh heard male voices over the phone and became agitated. He began quarrelling with his girlfriend, and a man who was with his girlfriend shouted at Poh over the phone, telling him not to ""act big"".
Intoxicated from a bottle of Martell liquor, Poh retrieved a knife from his home and headed to Prinsep Street where he confronted his girlfriend and the man who was with her.
Poh chased the man along Prinsep Street with the knife in his hand but was eventually stopped by his girlfriend. Before reaching home, Poh threw the knife into Rochor Canal, fearing he would get into trouble for possessing a knife.
He was remanded that same month. His accomplice Wang is based in Vietnam and remains at large, while the two friends who helped him in the scam were given two months' jail earlier this year for their roles.
The prosecutor asked for a year's jail for Poh, saying that he was significantly involved in the planning and coordination of the scam even though Wang was the mastermind."
Three men charged with obstructing investigations into suspected transfers of gasoil to North Korea,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-court-crime-men-charged-conspiracy-obstructing-investigation-north-korea-gasoil-tanker-transfer-2940021,"SINGAPORE: Three men were charged in court on Thursday (Sep 15) with several counts of conspiracy to obstruct investigations into suspected transfers of gasoil to North Korea. 
In October 2018, the police received information that a Singapore-registered oil tanker, Marine Tanker Sea Tanker II, was allegedly used in ship-to-ship transfers of gasoil with North Korean-flagged vessels, said the police in a news release. 
According to court documents, the accused are Ong Chou Hong, Jeremy Koh Renfeng and Benny Tan Chun Kiat. 
Koh, 40 and Tan, 47, were cargo officers on the oil tanker. Ong, 32, was employed as an assistant marine superintendent at Sea Hub Tankers. The company is the registered owner of the vessel. 
Police investigations revealed that the men had allegedly conspired to falsify records in the ship documents of MT Sea Tanker II, specifically, the official logbook and part of the oil record book. The documents contained information on the vessel's movement and cargo activity during the material period, said the police. 
The falsified records were then provided to the Singapore authorities who were investigating the vessel's activities. 
Further investigations revealed that prior to the vessel's return to Singapore, Ong and Koh allegedly conspired to dismantle and dispose of a computer processing unit that was onboard the oil tanker.
This was ""to prevent the Singapore authorities from obtaining information in the CPU relating to the vessel’s activities during the material period"", said the police. 
If found guilty of intentionally obstructing the course of justice under the Penal Code, they may be jailed up to seven years, fined or both."
Police looking into X Fitness gyms that customers say closed without warning,"One customer only found out that X Fitness gym had closed when she tried to book a class.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/x-fitness-kyklos-studio-close-down-overnight-police-2939986,"SINGAPORE: Police on Thursday (Sep 15) said they are looking into the closure of two fitness studios that customers say shuttered without warning.
Reports have been lodged over the closures of X Fitness spin studio in GR.iD mall and affiliated brand Kyklos Studio in Tekka Place, police confirmed.
A third outlet is located at the Hougang Sports Centre, according to a cached version of X Fitness’ website, which has since gone dark.
A customer who only wanted to be known as Weiling, 26, told CNA that she has been attending spin classes at X Fitness since July 2021 and had a pleasant experience.
“I didn’t receive any bad customer service,” she said, adding that instructors were friendly and X Fitness’ price point was more affordable than other studios. 
“The only reason why I even knew about them in the first place is because during then they hired a lot of TikTok influencers,” she said, adding that one such influencer worked as an instructor.
Weiling said there were no signs anything was wrong until Sep 12, when she tried to book a class at the GR.iD outlet.
About a month ago, X Fitness informed customers it was migrating the class booking platform from its own mobile app to an aggregator app like Mindbody, she said.
During the migration, students were asked to book classes by sending direct messages to the studio’s Instagram account.
Weiling told CNA she successfully booked a class in this way on Sep 6. It was the last class she attended at X Fitness.
On TikTok, another X Fitness customer who goes by Elyssa posted that she last attended a class on Sep 10 and had 35 classes left in her package.
When Weiling tried to book a class on Sep 12, she could no longer find the gym’s account on Instagram. She also could not find the studio on booking apps like Mindbody.
She realised something had gone wrong when she checked X Fitness’ website and saw that it was down. The gym’s website and social media accounts were still dark when CNA checked on Thursday afternoon.
Weiling made a police report on Sep 13.
She said there has been no communication from X Fitness about the closure of the gyms. She has contacted one of the gym’s instructors, known as Alan, on Instagram, but has not received a reply.
The only update came from an instructor who posted on Instagram saying that she was trying to contact the owners of X Fitness to find out what had happened, said Weiling.
Weiling estimated that she has 16 classes left in her 20-class package, which she bought for S$320.
She has filed a claim at the Small Claims Tribunal, but told CNA she has “sort of given up on getting the money back”. 
She said the experience has been a shock, adding: “It just didn’t occur to me that it will happen in Singapore.”"

The minister replied that more than 65 per cent of Singaporeans support the mandatory death penalty as of last year.
""But … what's the task of the Government? It is to do right by Singaporeans, what's in the best interest of society. If we believe, and we do, that the death penalty, in fact, saves thousands of lives, because of its deterrent effect,"" he said.
""And I can show you examples from all the other countries which don't have the death penalty, and lacks enforcement on drug policy, thousands more people die.""
According to Amnesty International, Singapore has executed five people so far this year for drug trafficking, with the courts in recent months dismissing eleventh-hour appeals from death row inmates.
In June, Mr Shanmugam told the BBC he had no doubts the death penalty is the right policy for drug trafficking, again pointing to ""'clear evidence"" of a serious deterrent for would-be traffickers.

No doubts that death penalty is the right policy for drug trafficking: Shanmugam













Addressing talk about a ""groundswell"" against Singapore's death penalty, through activists, news reports and prominent people like British entrepreneur Richard Branson, Mr Shanmugam pointed to an anti-death penalty protest at Hong Lim Park in April.
Organisers said more than 400 people turned up, but Mr Shanmugam believes these numbers are usually ""exaggerated"".
""Now, therefore, if we believe that it is the best interest of society, Singapore, and if the vast majority of Singaporeans support it, as they do, then do you want us to change policy because four newspapers write about it, talking to the same three activists and quoting the same three activists?"" he asked.
""And I'm not saying these are precise numbers, but I'm giving you the picture. So, the government policy, if 400 people plus three newspaper articles can change government policy, or if Mr Richard Branson can change government policy, then Singapore would not be where it is today.""
Mr Shanmugam also touched on Thailand's legalisation of cannabis and similar plans by Malaysia for medical marijuana, saying the increased availability of drugs will create more challenges for Singapore.
""But by and large, a vast majority of Singaporeans understand that drugs are bad, drugs are bad for society,"" he said on Wednesday.
""There is a small group that thinks that it ought to be legalised. And because of the portrayal in popular media, younger people, not the majority, they tend to have a slightly different view of cannabis and these are all challenges we have to deal with.""
When asked if this means authorities will look into tighter regulations and ""closer surveillance"" of those coming in from countries like Thailand and Malaysia, Mr Shanmugam said Singapore's regulations are ""adequate"".
""But the laws, the amount, the kind of evidence that is needed, the assumptions or presumptions that apply, the inferences the courts can draw, these are technical matters, and they are constantly reviewed,"" he said.
""And, you know, we have amended the law a number of times and we will amend it as we see necessary.""
REPEAL OF 377A AND CANCEL CULTURE
In the interview with Bloomberg, Mr Shanmugam was also asked about Singapore's decision to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code, which criminalises sex between men, and whether it is the first step to marriage equality.
Mr Shanmugam said the Government has a duty to lead and understand the people’s wishes, stressing that it is amending the Constitution to make it clear that any debate on what a marriage is will be held in Parliament and not through the courts.
The law currently defines marriage as between a man and a woman, he said, calling it a policy that the Government does not intend to change.
Religious groups have opposed the move to repeal Section 377A, with some expressing concerns that they could be attacked for their views against LGBTQ and marriage equality.
Mr Shanmugam said people should be encouraged to express their viewpoints on all sides, as long as it is not offensive and does not descend to hate speech.
This is why the Government is concerned about cancel culture, not just in the context of 377A but on a wide variety of issues, he said.
""The people’s freedom to express their views is curtailed in real life, in the physical world. We won’t allow five people to gang up and beat you up. That’s against the law,"" he said.
""It seems to be possible and happens in a virtual sense, on the Internet. And we need to find the right balance between free speech and aggressive attacking of others to curtail their free speech.""
Mr Shanmugam said the Government has been studying these questions for some time, and that it is something that could be put into legislation if the right solution is found.
""In fact, religious groups talk to us, but also LGBT groups have talked to us and they are being attacked. Religious groups, in particular, feel very put upon, because they feel that whenever they express their views, they are attacked as homophobes,"" he said.
""So, there is a line between expressing your view on religion, and becoming homophobic or engaging in hate speech against LGBT groups. And we've got to agree on, you know, these sorts of lines. So, we will have to involve people from the different sectors, get their viewpoints."""
When throwing things away becomes hard: Why people hoard,"Hoarding was discussed in Parliament recently, with several MPs asking questions on what is being done about the problem. Experts broke down the complex issue in interviews with CNA938, including how these items accumulate.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/why-people-hoard-how-hoarding-works-2939741,"SINGAPORE: Say “hoarder” and images of stacked newspapers and boxes, little space to move, and in some cases, scurrying cockroaches come to mind.
These are the kinds of homes that Habitat for Humanity Singapore has entered and tried to turn around. Decluttering them, however, does not mean entirely ridding them of unwanted items.
“When you use the word declutter, we are always assuming that we are able to get the hoarder to fully declutter but in our experience, we have not seen too many cases of that happening for those who severely hoard things,” said Mr Yong Teck Meng, the housing charity’s national director.
It is a “huge challenge”, he told CNA938.
“Every item you want to discard, you need to get the permission of the hoarder. Maybe about one hour, two hours down into the activity of decluttering, the hoarder will tell you that he or she is not able to go on because it's very traumatic to him, so then you have to stop,” he said.
What is more common is reducing the severity of hoarding to some extent, said Mr Yong.
Among the homes his organisation has tried to improve is one in Jurong that was so blocked that its occupier had to climb over a small mountain of items just to get inside. At another home, 33 visits over one-and-a-half years led to the clearing of just one-third of its contents.
WHY DO PEOPLE HOARD?
The root cause of hoarding behaviour is complex, Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann said in Parliament on Monday (Sep 12). She was responding to several questions from Members of Parliament on the issue which came to the fore after a fire in a cluttered home left one man dead.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force said at the time that the firefighting and damping down operation for the incident was very challenging as the entire unit contained ""a large volume of debris that was closely packed together from wall to wall"".
Hoarding could be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or developed after trauma or deep grief, she said.
The authorities are working on 260 active hoarding cases that remain ""protracted and unresolved"" because it is difficult to gain hoarders' cooperation to declutter, Ms Sim added.
Hoarding could also be linked to sentimental reasons.
Mr Sng Hock Lin, a PhD student at the Singapore University of Social Sciences who did a study on hoarding behaviour, said that he met a senior who was collecting stuffed toys and keeping them wrapped in plastic bags.
She had managed to accumulate discarded carnival tickets to collect the toys. When asked why, she said she was deprived of such toys during her difficult childhood, Mr Sng said.
“To her, it's a lot of memories of the childhood that she faced and also the emotional connection to those stuffed toys,” he said.
HOW THINGS ACCUMULATE
Hoarders might have difficulty discarding or parting ways with their possessions regardless of the actual value of the items, said clinical psychologist Stephanie Chan from Annabelle Psychology.
She gave examples of items like pieces of paper and plastic containers.
They may think they need to keep the items for next time or think of turning them in for a small profit, she said.
“What happens in a very cluttered environment is that these things start to take over the environment in a very disorganised manner that you no longer know where that one tin you have kept, maybe two weeks ago, has disappeared to,” she said.
“So you just think to yourself, maybe I need to collect another one just in case I need it again next time.”
The hoarder also has a problem trying to perceive what is of value, Mr Yong said.
“To us, it may look like a piece of junk, but to the hoarder, it could be as precious as a pound of gold,” he said.
“They keep collecting stuff and they keep accumulating for no conceivable purpose.”
However, a suggestion that the items should be discarded could bring about a “significant amount of distress” in such individuals, said Ms Chan.
Such distress would be a distinguishing factor between someone who simply has no time to clean up and someone who has a hoarding disorder, a mental health condition, said Ms Chan.

“The fine line between collecting and hoarding would be that the latter would impact the living spaces of that person to the point of endangering the safety of that person,” she said.
WHO ARE THE HOARDERS?
Research has shown that there is a larger proportion of hoarders who come from lower socio-economic backgrounds, said Ms Chan.
“If you think about it, this demographic would be more likely to live in smaller houses. It makes it a lot quicker for their things to clutter up and to build up to the extent that is unsafe restricting their movement,” she said.
She added that such individuals are also more likely to hoard if they're concerned about their financial ability to replace something, she said.
Mr Yong said that while his organisation serves people from lower income brackets, it does get requests from people who may be of higher socio-economic status, like those who live on landed property and in condominiums.
Age-wise, research shows that hoarding is about three times more prevalent in those aged above 55 compared to in younger adults, Ms Chan said.
HELPING THE HOARDERS
Mr Sng said helping hoarders takes a lot of compassion, patience and understanding.
Building relationship and trust is key, he said, adding that professionals may also be able to help.
“It takes a whole village and the community to come together … to help them,” he said.
Helping hoarders may need to begin with listening to them and asking them about their thoughts and concerns, said Ms Chan.
“A lot of times actually, such hoarders are distressed about their living environments, but they have perhaps sort of resigned to the fact that it has gotten to such a point that is beyond their control,” she said.
While professional help may be part of the solution, the hoarders may not have the awareness that there may be an issue with what they are doing in the first place, she said.
“It is important for them to know because only when they know that it’s an issue can they start accepting help,” she said.
An ambitious plan to clear up the home may be too overwhelming for them, she added.
“Some of them … might have anxiety attacks, because they have, in their mind, associated a lot of significance to these items, even though rationally and objectively we know that they are not (significant),” she said.
She added that there is a “high chance” of relapse for the condition, but being in therapy with a mental health professional could act as a “buffer” for the relapse.
“If you are saying (they should go) from a very cluttered corridor to a space that is spick and span, that’s quite a far reach,” she said.
“But at least to be able to keep things organised in a way that makes their living space more safe for themselves and for the neighbours - that could be a goal to work towards.”"
Man gets life imprisonment and caning for murdering fellow jogger in Punggol during 'circuit breaker',"The victim, who was stabbed while jogging along Punggol Field Road, was killed ""senselessly"", said the prosecutor.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/punggol-field-murder-jogger-stabbing-circuit-breaker-life-imprisonment-caning-surajsrikan-diwakar-mani-tripathi-court-2939766,"SINGAPORE: A man who stabbed a stranger to death during the COVID-19 ""circuit-breaker"" period in 2020 while they were both jogging has been sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
Surajsrikan Diwakar Mani Tripathi, 22, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Sep 15) to one count of murdering 38-year-old Tay Rui Hao.
The court heard that Surajsrikan was jobless at the time. Both he and Mr Tay lived in Punggol but did not know each other.
At about 10pm on May 10, 2020, both men left their homes for a run. This was during the circuit breaker when people were not allowed to leave their houses for non-essential activities although exercise was allowed.
Tay had started jogging two to three times a week since the start of the circuit breaker, while Surajsrikan was a regular runner.
May 10 was a significant date for Surajsrikan, the court heard, as it was the date his father had abandoned his family and it was also the date of his enlistment into National Service. The memory of the date caused him to be frustrated and angry.
When Surajsrikan left his home, he brought along a Singapore Armed Forces-issued Swiss folding knife with a 9cm-long blade, serrated on one edge, and a wet wipe.
While Surajsrikan was running, he missed his footing and fell near a bus stop along Punggol Field Road. He paced around for five to 10 minutes to work off his anger.
Mr Tay jogged past at about 11.10pm. Surajsrikan's anger ""overtook"" him, the court heard. He unfolded his knife, chased after Mr Tay and stabbed him forcefully in the back. 
Surajsrikan then stabbed and slashed the victim's arm and abdominal area when the victim was trying to sit up.
He wiped the blood off his knife and kept it, continuing to clean his hands as he walked back towards a block of flats. He did not call the police or an ambulance.
Surajsrikan wandered around the neighbourhood for about one-and-a-half hours before discarding the wet wipe and heading home at around 12.30am. He told his family he returned home late as he had fallen down while jogging and kept his knife in his cupboard.
The victim called 995. Paramedics found him bleeding on the grass. He was initially alert but lost consciousness later. He died early the next morning.
Surajsrikan was identified through police cameras that showed him wandering around the neighbourhood with a knife. He was arrested and the knife was recovered.
An autopsy on the victim uncovered 10 external injuries comprising incised wounds, abrasions and a deep gaping wound in a muscle. His cause of death was determined to be incised wounds of the right radial artery and a lung. 
Surajsrikan's DNA and blood were found on the knife as well as swabs lifted from his shoes. It is undisputed that he intentionally inflicted the injuries during his assault on the victim, of which two were sufficient to cause death.
ACCUSED'S MENTAL DISORDERS
Surajsrikan was examined and found to suffer from severe social anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. These had crippling effects on his life, leading to low mood and anger, but he did not qualify for a depressive disorder.
He was previously found to have borderline to low intelligence, but was not found to be intellectually disabled nor suffering from any psychotic disorder. The date of the killing exacerbated his chronic anger, the court heard.
However, his actions were not directly caused by his disorders, and he was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence.
Surajsrikan has no previous convictions. Deputy Public Prosecutors Andre Chong and Han Ming Kuang said they did not object to life imprisonment for Surajsrikan.
They asked also for 24 strokes of the cane should he receive life imprisonment. Mr Chong cited the following factors: Surajsrikan acted with premeditation rather than impulse, as he took a knife and wet wipe with him on the run.
VICTIM KILLED ""SENSELESSLY"" 
Surajsrikan killed the victim ""senselessly, simply to vent his anger over his own circumstances"", said Mr Chong, and in a brutal manner with multiple stabs.
The victim was a stranger to him and was simply going about his own business, said Mr Chong. Surajsrikan continued to stab him even after the victim tried to get up, and there is a lack of remorse in his conduct after the offence.
Surajsrikan was traced and arrested only six days later, and the offence took place in the middle of the circuit breaker period, causing ""substantial public disquiet"", said Mr Chong.
Defence lawyer Edmond Pereira concurred with the imposition of a life sentence, but asked the judge not to impose caning.
""To begin with, the accused person and in particular his family wish to express great remorse, regret and sadness for the passing of the deceased,"" he said.
He urged the court to consider that it was not a premeditated act but one of impulse.
""When he left home, he did not have any target in mind. His intention then was to harm himself, and in the end, he did not, and the circumstances that triggered him ... (are) again not something he had planned earlier, so it's something we submit happened out of impulse,"" said Mr Pereira.
He added that the date of the offence was very significant.
""At the time of offending he was 20 years old. He (did) not have any gainful employment, did not do well in education. As we have highlighted, he dropped out of school and he has this anxiety concern about crowds or being in the company of people, so he kept very much to himself, even when he was at home, he didn't like to hear noises, even from the neighbours or even family talking loud, so he would keep to himself in his room and the door closed,"" said Mr Pereira.
He said that even today in remand, Surajsrikan is in isolation in a single cell.
""(I) don't know if he's ever going to get better, if at all, but that wouldn't bring the life of the deceased back, and that's something he's told us is haunting him,"" said the lawyer.
""He (asked) himself, why did he do it, why not harm himself. He had thoughts of harming himself because he felt useless that he was not helping the family.""
Mr Pereira added that the date ""triggered"" him as it was the date Surajsrikan's father - whom he has never met - left his family. It was also the day he was enlisted in NS.
""His stint was quite short because of his behaviour, he was medically downgraded and subsequently discharged from SAF,"" said the lawyer.
Justice Dedar Singh Gill said Surajsrikan's sentence ""will not bring back the victim"" nor ""erase memories of this painful period"".
""But it is my hope that the sentencing will provide some sort of closure for the family of the victim. It is also my hope that the accused dutifully continues with his medication whilst in prison,"" he said."
Two CNB officers found to have engaged in conspiracy to swap urine sample of suspected drug offender ,"A third CNB officer who was part of the conspiracy previously pleaded guilty and was handed one-and-a-half year's jail in August 2020.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2-cnb-officers-conspiracy-swap-urine-sample-suspected-drug-offender-2938681,"SINGAPORE: Two Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers accused of being in a conspiracy to swap the urine sample of a man undergoing a drug test were found guilty by the State Courts on Thursday (Sep 15). 
Staff Sergeant Abdul Rahman Kadir, 46, and Sergeant Muhammad Zuhairi Zainuri, 34, were each convicted of one count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice by engaging in a conspiracy to tamper with Maung Moe Min Oo's urine sample between Aug 15 and Aug 16, 2018.
A third CNB officer, Staff Sergeant Mohamed Hafiz Lan, who was part of the conspiracy had pleaded guilty and was handed one-and-a-half year's jail on Aug 3, 2020. Maung Moe Min Oo's case is still in its pre-trial conference stage. 
Rahman and Zuhairi had claimed trial to the charge but were convicted on Thursday by District Judge Victor Yeo, who found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against both accused persons. 
The judge did not find Rahman to be a credible witness and disbelieved his evidence that he was not paying attention to Maung Moe Min Oo during the urine test, and was instead occupied with his mobile phone. 
Against Zuhairi, who had elected to remain silent in his defence, the judge agreed with the prosecution that an adverse inference be drawn for his ""failure to provide an explanation for his conduct at the material time"" in the face of ""overwhelming evidence adduced at trial"".

CNB officer jailed 18 months for switching man's urine sample













In closing submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Alan Loh and Thiagesh Sukumaran detailed the incident, from when Maung Moe Min Oo was detained at Woodlands Checkpoint with a female companion on suspicion of consuming drugs on Aug 15, 2018.
Maung Moe Min Oo had known that he would fail the drug test as he had consumed methamphetamine before being detained.
As an ex-drug offender, he knew that he would be sent to a drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) again and feared that his wife would leave him with his two children, according to the prosecution. 
In a bid to meddle with the urine test process, Maung Moe Min Oo sought Rahman's aid, as Rahman was in charge of the team dealing with the case. He lied to Rahman that he had inhaled secondhand smoke while in the room with someone smoking methamphetamine. 
""The events that occurred thereafter were crystal clear. (Rahman) engaged in a conspiracy with (Zuhairi) and (Hafiz) to tamper with Maung’s urine sample, enabling Maung to pass his Instant Urine Test (IUT) and leave the CNB office without any further action taken against him,"" said the prosecution. 
""Maung admitted to having consumed methamphetamine. If Maung had been correctly dealt with by the CNB duty team, Maung would either have been sent to the DRC if his urine sample was found positive for methamphetamine, or charged for failing to provide a urine sample ... if he had refused to provide a urine sample to the team for his IUT. 
""The conspiracy enabled Maung to escape either outcome.""
Maung Moe Min Oo's urine test was negative for illicit drugs and he was allowed to leave with his female companion. He went to Malaysia. 
However, the case unravelled when Maung Moe Min Oo re-entered Singapore on Aug 17, 2018 and was again detained for suspected drug consumption. He told this CNB team that Rahman had helped him pass his IUT test earlier on.

DETAILS LEADING UP TO SWAPPING
Having assessed Maung Moe Min Oo to be a ""difficult subject"", Zuhairi had suggested to Hafiz that they temper with the urine sample to expedite his departure from the CNB officer, said the prosecution.
Zuhairi had thought Maung Moe Min Oo to be ""cunning"" and ""uncooperative"" and felt that the officers would have to waste time doing ""unnecessary"" paperwork, it added. 
Zuhairi discussed the matter with Hafiz and concluded that the only way to clear Maung Moe Min Oo was if his urine test was negative for drugs. A closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera captured this exchange in the wee hours of Aug 16, 2018. 
Zuhairi was then recorded taking an empty red-capped bottle into the toilet.
According to the prosecution, Hafiz urinated into this bottle and left it in the toilet. He then instructed Maung Moe Min Oo to urinate into an identical bottle but dispose of its contents in the presence of Rahman. 
The prosecution said that the evidence in support of its case was ""strong and compelling"". These include how Zuhairi and Hafiz had ""confessed to conspiring to tamper with Maung Moe Min Oo's urine sample to expedite his departure from the CNB office"" in statements. 
Hafiz had also confessed to urinating into a bottle and leaving it in the toilet for the purposes of the swap. 
In his defence, Rahman claimed that he had been unaware that the urine sample had been tampered with. His lawyer, Peter Fernando, claimed that his client was not involved in the conspiracy, which was between Hafiz and Zuhairi. 
However, District Judge Yeo felt otherwise. ""His conduct during the events in question showed that he was part of the conspiracy to tamper with Maung’s urine sample,"" he said. 
Rahman had initially lied to the authorities that he had watched Maung Moe Min Oo urinate into the bottle but left when the bottle was half full. However, evidence showed that Rahman left the toilet together with Hafiz and the drug suspect. 
""Having viewed the CCTV footage, I did not find the explanation that Maung was of such a safety concern that Rahman had to escort Maung into the toilet to be convincing,"" said the judge.
""If there was indeed such a concern, he would have kept a close watch over Maung during the urine procurement to ensure that it was conducted properly, and that Maung did not attempt to hurt himself or others.""
NEXT HEARING
Zuhairi indicated that he would be appealing the decision, however Deputy Public Prosecutor Loh told the court that the prosecution would be objecting to bail pending appeal as Zuhairi had ""zero prospect"" of succeeding in an appeal.  
Both will return to court for sentencing on Nov 16. 
For intentionally obstructing the course of justice, each accused may be jailed up to seven years, fined, or both. 
In a separate statement, a CNB spokesperson said the agency takes a ""serious view of any complaint or allegation of impropriety"" about its urine testing processes.
In the course of a drug investigation, the agency uncovered possible acts of misconduct by the three CNB officers. It immediately referred the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) for investigation, and provided full cooperation to CPIB during the investigations. 
The spokesperson said Zuhairi and Rahman were interdicted from service since July 2019, adding that Zuhairi had resigned from service in February this year. 
As for Rahman who remains interdicted from service, CNB will begin disciplinary proceedings against him following his court conviction, with a view to dismiss him from service."
Six arrested for suspected involvement in money laundering activities,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/6-arrested-money-laundering-suspected-bank-account-atm-sim-cards-2939551,"SINGAPORE: Six people were arrested for their suspected involvement in money laundering activities, said the Singapore Police Force on Thursday (Sep 15).
The four men and two women, aged between 20 and 51, were nabbed during an islandwide anti-scam enforcement operation conducted on Sep 13 and Sep 14. 
The operation was carried out by officers from the Police Intelligence Department and Commercial Affairs Department. 
Another two women, aged 33 and 37, are being investigated for their suspected involvement in money laundering activities.
The police said that they received information in June this year regarding criminal proceeds arising from investment scams amounting to more than S$4.5 million. The funds were credited into several bank accounts in Singapore.
Preliminary investigations indicated that a 37-year-old man had allegedly placed online advertisements and acquired bank accounts with ATM cards and pre-registered prepaid SIM cards from unknown individuals.
These individuals were paid at least S$800 for each bank account and S$50 for each pre-registered prepaid SIM card.
The man was later established to be the reseller of the fraudulently obtained bank accounts with ATM cards and pre-registered prepaid SIM cards, said the police, adding that these were used to facilitate illegal activities. 
He is also believed to have withdrawn the criminal proceeds from the bank accounts.
Preliminary investigations by the police also revealed that two men, aged 38 and 39, had allegedly withdrawn money from the bank accounts and later converted the criminal proceeds into cryptocurrencies since January 2022.
The two women, aged 20 and 51, are believed to have facilitated the money laundering activities by withdrawing money from the bank accounts and later handing the criminal proceeds to the 37-year-old man.
Another bank account holder, a 32-year-old man, had allegedly sold and relinquished his bank account and ATM card to the 37-year-old man in July this year.
Several case exhibits such as more than S$19,000 in cash, 16 mobile phones, more than 30 pre-registered prepaid SIM cards and 150 ATM cards were found and seized from the possession of several of the suspects, said the police.
The three men will be charged in court on Thursday. The 37-year-old man will be charged with the offence of assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct.
The two men, aged 38 and 39, will be charged with the offence of possessing benefits from criminal conduct.
Those found guilty face a fine of up to S$500,000 and/or a jail term not exceeding 10 years.
Investigations against the remaining suspects are ongoing.
The police said that they will not hesitate to take action against anyone involved in arrangements to allow their bank accounts to be used for illegal purposes such as the laundering of criminal proceeds. 
“To avoid being an accomplice to crimes, members of the public should always reject requests by others to open and/or sell bank accounts, or receive money in their bank accounts, as they will be held accountable if these are linked to criminal activities,” they added.

More restaurants implement reservation fees to prevent no-shows as bookings spike,"Restaurants that implemented reservation fees told CNA they saw a marked drop in the number of last-minute cancellations and no-shows. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/restaurants-reservation-booking-fee-deposit-no-show-cancellation-2930231,"SINGAPORE: With more people dining out as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes, some restaurants now require customers to place reservation deposits or credit card holding fees to prevent no-shows or last-minute cancellations. 
Ms Tan Woan Shin, who oversees marketing and public communications at Thai restaurant Un Yang Kor Dai, said the restaurant implemented a reservation credit card holding fee of S$25 to reduce the number of no-shows. 
“We just want to reduce and avoid those customers that make multiple bookings on the same day but in different restaurants,” she told CNA. 
Before it implemented a credit card holding fee, the restaurant had two to four no-shows a week. 
“After we implemented it, the rate dropped until about every month, only one or two tables do not turn up,” said Ms Tan. 
In most cases when a restaurant asks for a reservation guarantee, the customer is not actually charged the fee, said the Restaurant Association of Singapore. The credit card holds the amount, and the amount is released after the meal instead of being deducted from the bill.
Other restaurants may choose to charge an actual booking fee upfront, and the deposit is later deducted from the bill. 
Grub implemented a credit card holding fee of S$50 per table for both of its outlets at Stevens Road and Junction 8 late last year. 
The fee applies to groups of five and above on weekends at the Stevens Road outlet and every day at the Junction 8 outlet, which is generally busier, marketing director Amanda Phan said. 
If customers cancel their reservation with less than 24 hours' notice or do not show up, they forfeit their deposit. 
This has been “very helpful” to reduce no-shows, said Ms Phan, adding that more customers now call if they need to cancel the reservation instead of simply not showing up.

Police warn against restaurant reservation scams after F&B operators lose S$73,500













Restaurant company The Cicheti Group said its outlets received complaints when they first implemented a holding fee because customers thought it was a charge on their credit card. 
""This reservation credit card hold is not a charge at all,"" said managing partner Ronald Kamiyama. ""Their bank will put it there and hold it, but we don't receive that money at all unless we go ahead into our system and charge for it."" 
IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC
Since the pandemic, more customers make reservations instead of walking in, restaurants told CNA. This is especially so for bigger groups, as safe-distancing measures had made it more difficult to get tables. 
But some diners make bookings at multiple restaurants on the same day, and only decide on the day itself where they want to go, resulting in no-shows or last-minute cancellations, said restaurant owners and managers. 
The Cicheti Group, known for its casual dining Italian restaurants, implemented a credit card holding fee about six months after the pandemic started, said Mr Kamiyama. 
""We were never planning to do so in the past. We did notice that even before COVID, people would book on a weekend or whichever day and then they wouldn't show up. Depending on the outlet, it was okay, it wasn't a big deal for us because we did take some walk-ins from the outside. 
""When COVID started, it became really bad because we relied on reservations. Not many people were walking around to walk into our restaurants."" 
Before the holding fee, some of the group's outlets saw about 10 no-shows each weekend, said Mr Kamiyama. 
""When people don't show up we give them a call. But (they) were also not responding to calls or not getting back to us,"" he said, adding that they would wait for the guests thinking that they were late, and deny walk-in guests the table. 
""Ultimately, we would lose the table completely because of that."" 
The group currently requires reservation holds of S$20 to S$40 per person, depending on the outlet. A busier outlet, like Cicheti along Kandahar Street, which sees more walk-in customers, would have a lower reservation hold fee. 
""It's just a matter of communication, right? It really doesn't take much to pick up a phone and call an outlet if you're not coming. It's okay if people cancel, but at least let us know so that we can give the table to somebody else,"" said Mr Kamiyama.

Grub saw more reservations throughout the pandemic, and as a result, there were more no-shows even though staff called customers the day before their reservation to confirm their attendance, said Ms Phan. 
“For now, people make the reservation, then if they don’t want to come, at least they will tell us … Sometimes people say I got COVID or my friend got COVID, we generally don’t take the deposit. 
“Even if you inform us a few hours before, it helps a lot. Then we just release the table for walk-ins to come in.” 
The company was initially hesitant to implement a holding fee for fear of turning customers away. Some customers are also not willing to leave their credit card details for a booking at a more casual restaurant like Grub, Ms Phan acknowledged.
But the no-shows pushed the team to go ahead with the holding fee. 
“We call them and they confirm and say they’re coming, and we hold the table for them. But they don’t come, and we call them and they just either ignore our call or say they can’t make it anymore. But by then we would already have left that table empty for 45 minutes,” said Ms Phan. 
“It happened to us quite a few times … We were left with no choice,” she said. 
Sometimes, the restaurant would be empty although there was a long queue of walk-in customers waiting outside.
“It was quite a double whammy. The walk-ins cannot sit and the reservations don’t turn up or they’re late and they don’t even bother to call.”

FINE DINING VS CASUAL DINING
Having a credit card hold or reservation deposit is becoming a widely accepted practice around the world, especially in fine dining, said a spokesperson for the Restaurant Association of Singapore. 
“Not so much for casual restaurants. This is because the cost of the premium ingredients, the high menu price and limited seating capacity of such restaurants make it prudent for fine dining to do so.” 
Marketing director for the il Lido group of restaurants Evelyn Yo noted that with online booking portals like Chope, taking a credit card holding fee has become more of a standard practice across the industry. 
The il Lido group is best known for its one-Michelin-starred restaurants Braci at Boat Quay and Art at National Gallery. It also runs casual dining restaurants Amo and Gemma, and two bars, Southbridge and Levant. 
At its Michelin-star restaurants, the group takes a reservation credit card hold of S$50 per diner. At its other establishments, this only applies to groups of five and above. Customers are not charged if they cancel the reservation with at least 24 hours' notice. 
“Especially in the fraternity of Michelin-starred fine-dining restaurants, I dare say that this is a very friendly policy. Some of our colleagues are charging full menu price or half menu price, or even S$100 (per head),” said Ms Yo. 
The group’s restaurants saw a “quite significant” number of last-minute cancellations and no-shows in the past few years, with many diners citing COVID-19-related reasons. 
“During this time, we were flexible with it, especially with the few waves throughout COVID,” said Ms Yo, adding that they did not charge the penalty for last-minute cancellations and no-shows who wrote in to plead their case. 
When asked whether the group plans to make its cancellation policy more stringent as the pandemic eases, Ms Yo said there are fewer last-minute cancellations now that the big infection waves are over. 
“I think it just serves as a gentle reminder that we’re taking your reservation seriously. If you are not able to show … We like to give our diners the benefit of the doubt, but stereotypically Singaporeans respond to the carrot and the stick,” she added. 
“So sometimes you impose a bit of a penalty to remind them don’t take this casually, we’ve got a waitlist, we’d like to welcome other paying guests and not hold your table.”

Not all restaurants have been successful at implementing a booking fee. Enjoy Eating House & Bar, which has outlets at Jalan Besar and Stevens Road, tried to implement a reservation deposit earlier this year but many customers were unwilling to pay the fee, said its co-owner James Ang. 
Initially, the restaurant would charge between S$50 and S$100 depending on the size of the table. For example, a group of 10 people would need to pay S$50 to reserve a table. Customers could transfer the sum through PayNow or other digital payment methods, and it would be deducted from the bill after the meal. 
“But recently, we decided to stop doing this, and only take deposits for reservations above 16 pax,” said Mr Ang. 
“There was a lot of miscommunication, customers weren't willing to pay the deposit. I feel that the Singaporean culture is perhaps not ready for paying money for a reservation …Because of the operational issues that it caused, we decided to raise (the number).”

The team wanted to implement a reservation deposit because both outlets had limited capacity and can seat only 40 to 50 people. 
“Let’s say a big group of 10 pax or more ... it’s about 25 per cent of our capacity. So if the big groups don’t show, then it impacts our sales because we reject other tables to keep the reservation,” Mr Ang said. 
The restaurant saw the number of last-minute cancellations and no-shows peak with the COVID-19 infection waves, he added. 
“Pre-COVID, what we experienced is that there’s still cancellations and no-shows, but the walk-ins would quite easily make up for that most of the time,” said the restaurant owner. 
“But with the pandemic coming in, business has been suffering, walk-ins have dropped also. So the impact of the no-shows and cancellations is actually bigger on the restaurants.”"
3-year-old girl dies from COVID-19 infection; third patient under 12 to die of the disease in Singapore,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/3-year-old-girl-dies-covid-19-third-patient-under-12-singapore-2938431,"SINGAPORE: A three-year-old girl died of COVID-19 in Singapore on Tuesday (Sep 13), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday.
She is the third patient under 12 to die of the disease in Singapore. 
The Singaporean girl had a history of multiple medical conditions prior to contracting COVID-19, said MOH in response to media queries.
She tested positive for the coronavirus via an antigen rapid test on Aug 9 and was admitted to hospital on Aug 13.
She died on Tuesday of anoxic brain injury - a lack of oxygen to the brain - due to cardiac arrest and COVID-19 infection, the Health Ministry said.
In June, a one-and-a-half-year-old Singaporean boy became Singapore's first coronavirus death in a patient under 12. 
The cause of his death was encephalitis due to COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus infections. 
He had no other past medical history and was previously well, MOH said in June. 
The second fatality was a four-year-old Singaporean girl who died in July. 
She had no past medical history and was previously well, said MOH then. 
Singapore reported 2,426 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Wednesday, including 2,166 local infections. 
Singapore has recorded 1,867,168 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, and 1,604 deaths.

Sending teachers on work attachments outside the education sector requires a collective effort: Chan Chun Sing,"Since the Teacher Work Attachment Plus programme was rolled out at the start of 2022, about 150 teachers have been matched to roles in sectors like manufacturing, environment as well as trade and connectivity. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sending-teachers-work-attachments-outside-education-sector-requires-collective-effort-chan-chun-sing-2937996,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) held its first in-person work plan seminar since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on Wednesday (Sep 14) to discuss priorities and innovation in education. 
During the seminar, about 1,500 school leaders and teachers came together to discuss the capabilities and competencies that students will need in time to come, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing told reporters at the sidelines of the event.
He also commended the Teacher Work Attachment Plus programme which has so far matched about 150 teachers to roles in different sectors like manufacturing, environment and trade and connectivity.
The programme was rolled out in 2022, and since then, about 80 teachers have completed their attachments, said MOE in a separate statement. 
Teachers can sign up for it based on their own interests and get their school principal’s endorsement before submitting their application. The work attachment period is typically between two and four weeks.
The Education Ministry will continue to work with schools to ensure that more teachers can benefit from the programme, the statement read. 
The expansion of the teacher work attachment programme has a few objectives, said Mr Chan. 
“I think we all know our teachers work very hard. Regularly, they also want to be given a break to learn something new for themselves. We have a saying in MOE, you cannot keep pouring from an empty cup,” he added. 
Opportunities outside of the school system give teachers the credibility to guide students on their future career choices or career paths, said the Education Minister. 
“During the session just now, we also have various educators who were previously from other industries who have come to join the education service, and they also bring with them a different set of experiences that can enrich the whole learning environment,” said Mr Chan. 
Those who spoke during the seminar said teachers and school leadership will need to commit to spending time and management bandwidth to plan for teachers to go out on industry attachments, he noted. 
“When we plan for someone to go out for exposure, it must be intentional. What kind of sectors suit the individual, how much time they spend, who to cover their duties while they are away,” said Mr Chan.

Coming out from the session, participants set an objective that every school should have at least one person “out there learning something new, something different”, he shared. 
“If we do that systematically, everyone will have a chance to do it once at least every five years. Or if it’s not a long-term attachment, it can also be an ongoing partnership doing projects and things like that,” he added. 
“So our aim is that every five years, everyone will have the opportunity to learn something new, learn something different. But that requires a collective effort, means as a team, we must cover each other’s duties while someone is away to learn something new. And when that someone comes back, he or she in turn covers the duties of someone else. 
“But through this process, we really hope that the teachers bring back new perspectives, new energies, not just to energise the students but also for their own personal development.” 
On helping students prepare for the future, Mr Chan said the attendees also discussed how to equip teachers and educators with the capabilities to teach and facilitate students' learning.
“For example, how do we ignite the curiosity in (students) that their success is not defined by what they’ve achieved in the first 15 years in terms of academic results but really what they will achieve in the next 50 years beyond the school system where they can keep on learning,” he added. 
One way is to equip teachers with new skillsets to take care of students with higher needs and their families, said Mr Chan."

Singapore grants interim authorisation for first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine
Singapore has granted interim authorisation for its first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine. The Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron COVID-19 jab by Moderna comprises two components that target the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant respectively.
It is an updated version of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine.
It is authorised for use as a booster in individuals aged 18 years and above, who have received primary series COVID-19 vaccination.
Safety data from the clinical studies showed that the bivalent vaccine was generally well-tolerated. The Health Sciences Authority added that it will take the necessary action and provide updates to the public if significant safety concerns are identified.

Employment in Q2 recovers to near pre-pandemic levels, but MOM warns of uncertainty ahead
The labour market continued to improve in the second quarter of 2022, with total employment reaching 99.5 per cent of the level in December 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Labour Market Report.
Resident employment grew to 4.2 per cent above the pre-pandemic level in June, while non-resident employment remained 10 per cent below the pre-pandemic level. Despite the improvements in Q2, ""there is heightened economic uncertainty ahead,"" said the ministry.
The tourism and aviation sectors are expected to continue to benefit from a strong recovery in air passengers and international visitor arrivals. But growth in outward-oriented sectors like finance and insurance services is expected to slow due to the global headwinds.
Non-resident employment is expected to rise as it catches up with pre-pandemic levels, but resident employment growth is likely to be more ""subdued"", MOM said.
Malaysian ringgit slips to a new 24-year low vs US dollar

"CNA Explains: What is a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, and how will it protect me?","Moderna's bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, which was granted interim authorisation by Singapore's Health Sciences Authority for use as a booster shot, targets both the original strain and Omicron BA.1 variant of the coronavirus.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-bivalent-covid-19-vaccine-booster-how-will-it-protect-me-moderna-pfizer-biontech-hsa-omicron-2937526,"SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) announced on Wednesday (Sep 14) that it has granted interim authorisation to Moderna’s bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a booster shot, under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).
Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron COVID-19 vaccine is the first bivalent vaccine against the coronavirus to be authorised as a booster here. HSA said it consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts in making the regulatory decision.
The authority added that its clinical review was based on an ongoing Phase 2/3 trial conducted by Moderna in individuals aged 18 and above.
Here's what you need to know before scheduling your next booster shot:
WHAT IS A BIVALENT VACCINE?
Bivalent vaccines are so-called because they work by simulating an immune response against two different antigens, such as viruses.
Multivalent vaccines - which protect against more than one type of antigen - have been around for a long time.
In fact, if you’re a woman, you may have taken one of them already – Gardasil-9 is currently used in Singapore as a vaccine against diseases caused by several types of the Human Papillomavirus, or HPV, including cervical cancer.
Your annual influenza jab is also an example. It's quadrivalent, which means it protects you from four virus types: Two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.
HOW IS THIS VACCINE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COVID-19 VACCINES?
The COVID-19 vaccines used in Singapore until now have been monovalent, which means they only contain or encode the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In comparison, Moderna’s bivalent vaccine has been updated to protect against the Omicron BA.1 variant in addition to the original strain. It contains 25 micrograms each of the components targeting the two viruses.

HSA said its clinical review showed that the booster vaccine “elicited a strong immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant, while preserving the immune response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain”.
It added that preliminary data from an exploratory analysis suggested that the vaccine may stimulate antibodies from other variants, including the Omircon BA.4/5, Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma.
WHO CAN TAKE THIS BOOSTER VACCINE?
People who are aged 18 and above and who have received their primary COVID-19 vaccine doses are eligible to receive the bivalent shot.
Official recommendations will be issued by the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination and the Ministry of Health “in due time”, said HSA.
WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS? 
Clinical studies have shown that the bivalent vaccine was “generally well-tolerated” and has a safety profile consistent with Moderna’s original Spikevax vaccine.
Side effects were mostly mild to moderate, HSA said. This includes pain and/or tenderness at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.
The authority noted that these are “generally associated with vaccinations and expected as part of the body’s natural response to build immunity against COVID-19”, which usually resolve on their own within a few days.
IS ANYONE ELSE DEVELOPING A BIVALENT COVID-19 VACCINE?
Yes. Pfizer-BioNTech has a bivalent vaccine that works similarly to Moderna’s and targets the same two strains of COVID-19 virus. It has been approved in some countries as a single-dose booster for individuals aged 12 and above.
Singapore has yet to authorise this vaccine for use in the country. However, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Tuesday that MOH is bringing both types of vaccine into Singapore under agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.
“Our intention is to update our vaccines for the National Vaccination Programme as the formulations improve,” said Mr Ong said."
"Man jailed for pointing knife at colleague he was infatuated with, demanding intimate acts",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-baker-jailed-pointing-knife-salesgirl-colleague-infatuated-demand-intimate-acts-court-2937416,"SINGAPORE: A baker was infatuated with a colleague at his company and became upset when he heard that she was getting married.
He pointed a knife at her neck, wanting to compel the woman into engaging in intimate acts with him.
Malaysian Lim Chee Wee, 37, was sentenced to a year's jail on Wednesday (Sep 14). He pleaded guilty to one count of criminal intimidation, with a second charge taken into consideration.
The court heard that Lim worked in the same bakery as the victim, but rarely interacted with her as Lim worked in the kitchen while the victim manned the cashier.
""The accused was infatuated with the victim and would often have sexual fantasies about her,"" said the prosecutor.
Sometime around March this year, Lim found out that the victim got engaged and became upset.
On Jun 17, Lim ended work and sat in the staff locker room playing games and watching videos on his phone.
Around 6pm, the victim ended her shift and entered the locker room to pack her belongings and clock out.
Upon seeing the victim, the accused had the sudden desire to be physically intimate with her, said the prosecutor.
However, Lim knew the victim would not consent to being intimate with him. He picked up a knife with an 18cm-long blade from the kitchen and went back to the locker room, closing the door behind him.
He then advanced towards the victim and pointed the knife at her neck. He did so intending to compel the victim into engaging in intimate acts with him, the court heard.
The victim did not comply and screamed while trying to wrestle the knife away from Lim. In the scuffle, the victim sustained a cut on her left thumb.
She managed to pry the knife away from Lim, but Lim covered her mouth with his hand and told her repeatedly not to shout. He then tried to kiss the victim's mouth and cheek but failed as the victim struggled against him.
The victim continued shouting and began screaming that Lim was trying to rape her. Afraid of being caught, Lim ran out of the locker room, and other colleagues came to help.
They detained Lim and the victim called her brother to tell him what happened. Her brother called the police.
The prosecutor called for at least two years' jail. He said the degree of alarm caused to the victim was high, albeit not prolonged, as she genuinely believed Lim would rape her at knifepoint.
He cited the immediacy of the threat, the fact that the accused pointed the knife directly at the victim's neck, and the ""sexually exploitative motivation behind his offending behaviour"".
For criminal intimidation with threat of hurt by a dangerous weapon, the man could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined, or both."

The Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron COVID-19 jab by Moderna comprises two components that target the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant respectively.
It is an updated version of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine that is based only on the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, said HSA in a news release. 
It is authorised for use as a booster in individuals aged 18 years and above, who have received primary series COVID-19 vaccination.
The interim authorisation was granted under Singapore’s Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told Parliament on Tuesday that MOH is bringing Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's new bivalent vaccines into the country, under agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.
The bivalent vaccines target both the ancestral strain of COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, which includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.
SINGLE DOSE
The Moderna booster shot is a single dose comprising two components: 25 micrograms targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and 25 micrograms targeting the Omicron BA.1 variant.
Official vaccination recommendations using this booster will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in due time, added HSA. 
HSA said that it has carefully reviewed the data from Moderna’s pre-clinical studies, clinical trials in human volunteers, manufacturing and quality controls, and assessed that the benefits outweighed the risks for use of the bivalent vaccine as a booster to protect against COVID-19 as the virus continues to evolve. 
In making this regulatory decision, HSA added that it also consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts.
The authority said its clinical review was based on an ongoing Phase 2/3 trial conducted by Moderna in individuals aged 18 years and above.
The results showed that the bivalent booster vaccine elicited a strong immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant, while preserving the immune response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.
“The preliminary data from an exploratory analysis also suggested that the vaccine may stimulate antibodies against Omicron BA.4/5, as well as other variants such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma,” it added. 
“Hence, it could be reasonably expected that the bivalent booster vaccine can enhance the immunity against the Omicron variants, while maintaining the base protection conferred by the original vaccine.”
Safety data from the clinical studies showed that the bivalent vaccine was generally well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with what is known for the original Spikevax vaccine. 
“The adverse events were mostly mild-to-moderate, such as injection site pain and/or tenderness, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. 
“These reactions are generally associated with vaccinations and expected as part of the body’s natural response to build immunity against COVID-19. They usually resolve on their own within a few days,” said HSA. 
HSA will continue to actively monitor the safety of the vaccine and require Moderna to submit data from the ongoing clinical study, to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks when used during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The authority added that it will take the necessary actions and provide updates to the public if significant safety concerns are identified.
Dr Mimi Choong May Ling, chief executive officer of HSA, said the COVID-19 pandemic has ""evolved significantly"" with recent surges around the world due to the rapid spread of highly transmissible variants such as Omicron.
""Updated COVID-19 vaccines such as bivalent vaccines are expected to offer broader immunity against circulating variants, while retaining critical protection against severe disease and death.""

Aesthetically pleasing solar panels in the spotlight as demand for solar fittings rise,"Aesthetically designed solar panels can be ideal for vertical installations on buildings as Singapore’s demand for green energy rises and rooftops run out of space, experts said.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nus-baba-peranakan-house-green-solar-panels-energy-demand-2937116,"SINGAPORE: The blue National University of Singapore (NUS) Baba House is set to go green with solar panels fashioned in Peranakan-style designs fitted into the sides of its building.
These panels will be fitted vertically to the three-storey townhouse located in Singapore’s historic district of Blair Plain, a change from conventional solar panels which are usually placed horizontally on roofs or on the ground.
About 20 to 30 modules will be installed on the west facade of the house, which will allow maximum energy absorption in the afternoons, Mr Mauro Pravettoni from NUS’ Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), told CNA.
Once fitted with its patterned solar panels and integrated with conventional rooftop panels​, the heritage house is expected to save about a-third of its electricity consumption.
The restored townhouse, built around 1895 and once home to a Peranakan Chinese family, is part of the NUS Centre for the Arts.
The artwork on the panels were inspired by Peranakan culture, and tailored to fit with the design of the historic house, said Ms Karen Lim, curator of NUS Museum.
“We wanted something that is customised to Baba House, since (it) is an old heritage house built in the 19th century and we thought that it would give a very special identity to the house itself. It will bring out the hybridity of Peranakan culture in Singapore,’ she said.
Ms Lim hopes that the cultural landmark – a piece of Singapore’s history – will play a vital role in mapping out a greener future for 6,500 shophouses in the country.
“This house to us is not just a house, it’s a living artefact,” Ms Lim said. “When we look into the conservation of the house… all the research database we are collecting will help to further Singapore’s efforts in sustainability.”
“(We want to) educate Singaporeans who own shophouses, and to show that it is possible for them to adopt new energy, renewable energy, and help as a collective effort for Singapore’s management of climate change and global warming,” she said.
















SOLAR DEMAND ON THE RISE
Solar installations are on the rise in Singapore.
Fittings at residences went up by 154 and the private sector added 55 fixtures in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the previous quarter, according to numbers released by the Energy Market Authority.
Raising energy costs, awareness, and the global environment are among the factors driving solar adoption, said Mr Lim Cheong Boon, head of Asia Pacific product and marketing at Trina Solar.
“We can also look at it from energy security, because solar itself is something which you install on your roof or within the boundaries of your country, so there’s a security that the energy will always be there, it doesn’t depend on imported energy sources to power your needs,” Mr Lim said.
Singapore's solar deployment goal is to generate enough electricity to meet the annual needs of around 350,000 households by 2030.

Commentary: Why is sunny Singapore not covered with rooftop solar panels?













Aesthetically designed solar panels like those planned for the NUS Baba House can be ideal for vertical installations on buildings as Singapore’s demand for green energy rises and rooftops run out of space, experts said.
AESTHETICS VS EFFICIENCY
A disadvantage of placing panels vertically means they get less sunlight, and industry players​ say advanced technology is needed before vertical fittings can be widely used.
“Considering the power generation of the vertical solar, to the conventional tilted installation, the power generation is still less,” said Mr Lim. “So we think the technology still needs to be further matured and developed before we can see widespread adoption of vertical solar.”
While designs on solar panels can improve aesthetics, efficiency will be reduced between 5 and 25 per cent, depending on design and colour, said Mr Pravettoni.
NUS Baba House’s aesthetically pleasing modules will likely see a loss of about 25 per cent on energy absorption compared with plain ones, but Mr Pravettoni said efficiency can be improved by using different material, textures, or designs.
“Colour modules – the real reason why we do that is to harmonise (with) building façade. It belongs to an idea of having modules that are trying to fulfill certain aesthetic needs. In this case, the real novelty is to have repeated patterns,” he said.
Mr Pravettoni explained that identical patterns in the Peranakan-inspired panels allow each cell to receive the same amount of sunlight, which can help to improve their efficiency and safety.
Despite the compromise on energy intake, he said aesthetics are important.
“Clearly aesthetics is important when it’s on a building because nobody wants a building to be ugly. So you want to have a building that is aesthetically appealing to the surroundings and people can look at the building and say: ‘Wow that is amazing. This is PV (photovoltaic)? That’s amazing’”, he said, referring to photovoltaic technology used in solar installations.
HUGE FUTURE POTENTIAL
While vertical installations and patterned panels are still in their early days, researchers see huge potential to integrate these solar installations on the thousands of untapped building facades in Singapore.
“Almost all over the city you have a lot of high-rise buildings and less low-rise buildings. And in high rise buildings, the vertical surface is much larger than the roof,” said Mr Pravettoni.
Apart from attaching solar panels, experts are also looking at integrating solar technology into buildings, and even along roads.
“Another approach is to (replace) a building element such as a window with a photovoltaic building element,” said Mr Pravettoni.
“There’s a lot of work still to be done but if we achieve this goal, then most of the buildings in Singapore can have photovoltaics integrated in their facades,” he said.
“Other ideas are to use (them) as noise barriers such as on the sides of a motorway or railway to act as protection for the noise and meanwhile producing electricity, and these are also installed vertically,” said Mr Pravettoni.

"Lawyer Charles Yeo remains at large, arrest warrant against him extended ","Charles Yeo said in an Instagram post in July that he was seeking ""political asylum"" in the United Kingdom.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/charles-yeo-former-reform-party-chairman-large-arrest-warrant-extended-2937206,"SINGAPORE: Lawyer Charles Yeo Yao Hui, who absconded from the country with criminal charges pending against him, remains outside of Singapore and at large, a district court heard on Wednesday (Sep 14).
Yeo, 32, was charged in January with harassing a police officer and wounding the religious feelings of Christians in some social media posts.
A warrant of arrest was issued for the former Reform Party chairman in August after he breached the conditions for overseas travel while on bail.
The State Courts had granted Yeo permission to travel to Vietnam for work between Jul 27 and Jul 30. However, he did not return to Singapore and did not report to the investigation officer on Aug 1 as he was required to.
Instead, he posted an announcement on Instagram on Jul 30 saying he was seeking ""political asylum"" in the United Kingdom. He made repeated claims that the criminal charges against him were ""politcally motivated"".
On Wednesday, the court reviewed the warrant to arrest. Two public prosecutors attended the case, with one telling the court that Yeo still remains ""outside of jurisdiction"".
The Police Gazette is still active against him, and she applied for the warrant to arrest to be extended. She asked for a review of the warrant to be fixed in about six months.
The judge fixed another review of the arrest warrant in March next year."
Lawyer given conditional warning for breaching gag order in case of doctor acquitted of molestation,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-given-conditional-warning-discharge-breaching-gag-order-dr-yeo-sow-nam-molest-acquittal-johannes-hadi-eugene-thuraisingam-court-2936906,"SINGAPORE: A lawyer has been given a conditional warning for publishing transcripts from the case of a doctor acquitted of molestation, in breach of a gag order protecting the complainant's identity.
At the same time, 32-year-old Johannes Hadi received a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for two counts under the State Courts Act of breaching a gag order.
Mr Hadi was a junior lawyer under lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam defending Dr Yeo Sow Nam. Dr Yeo was acquitted of all counts of molesting a woman after a trial.
According to Mr Hadi's charges, he published transcripts of the court proceedings containing unredacted information likely to lead to the identification of the woman by distributing the transcripts to the press on Mar 16 last year.
A second charge states that he distributed transcripts containing unredacted information likely to identify the complainant to the press again on Aug 11, 2021.
In response to CNA's queries, a spokesperson for the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said the prosecution applied for Mr Hadi's charges to be given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal ""after careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case"".
A conditional warning was issued to Mr Hadi, and he may be prosecuted on the same charges should he reoffend, said the AGC spokesperson.
She said that the prosecution took into account the fact that Mr Hadi was a junior lawyer who had acted under the instructions and supervision of Mr Thuraisingam, who was lead counsel in the case for Dr Yeo Sow Nam.
""Given Mr Hadi's role in the incident, a conditional warning in lieu of prosecution was issued to him,"" said the AGC spokesperson.
Mr Thuraisingam pleaded guilty to breaching a gag order in relation to the same incident and was fined S$4,000 in August.
The penalty for breaching a gag order is up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
"National Kidney Foundation warns of rapidly rising renal failure cases, urges more to opt for dialysis at home","Six people are now diagnosed every day, a three-fold increase from two decades ago, and it is estimated that five dialysis centres need to be built every year to cope with the increase.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nkf-kidney-failure-tsunami-dialysis-2936766,"SINGAPORE: The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) has warned of a “kidney tsunami” with the number of renal failure cases in Singapore rising at a rate that will make it hard for the healthcare system to cope.
Six people are now diagnosed every day, a three-fold increase from two decades ago.
The NKF, which cares for a majority of dialysis patients in the country, treats 600 new patients each year. NKF currently has 41 centres, but with kidney failure cases rising more quickly because of ageing and diabetes, it is estimated that five additional centres need to be built every year.
NKF gets about 100 new dialysis applications per month, its chief executive officer Tim Oei told CNA.
“That is of grave concern that we see must be addressed and we can't keep on providing space, neither can the hospitals cope,” he said.
Haemodialysis, which NKF provides, has to be done at a centre by a nurse and needs to be done thrice a week, four hours each time, he said.
PERITONEAL DIALYSIS AT HOME
Singapore cannot fully rely on haemodialysis, said Mr Oei. 
While prevention of renal failure is important as a long-term goal in easing the load, in the short term, more support can be given in the community for peritoneal dialysis which can be done at home, he said.
NKF is aiming to get more kidney dialysis patients on peritoneal dialysis, a shift the Government has also called for.
Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a speech in August this year that his ministry is pushing for a peritoneal dialysis-preferred approach for patients who are eligible for this treatment option.
The aim is to have 30 per cent of new dialysis patients to opt for peritoneal dialysis by 2025, up from the current rate of 20 per cent, he said.
In peritoneal dialysis, a special sterile fluid is introduced into the abdomen through a permanent tube that is placed in the peritoneal cavity – the space within the abdomen that contains the intestines, the stomach and the liver. The fluid circulates through the abdomen to draw impurities which are then drained from the body.
“Peritoneal dialysis can be done at home. That allows patients more flexibility in terms of suiting their lifestyle and also gives them flexibility to make other arrangements be it work or home,” he said.
Currently, training is provided in hospitals, but NKF wants to support peritoneal dialysis in the community setting, he added.
















“We feel that some of this training can be done in a community setting, be it at an NKF centre or at the home of the patients and the idea is to give them time to settle in this treatment modality,” he said.
There is a lack of understanding on the pros and cons of both therapies, Mr Oei said. To help patients, NKF arranges for new patients to be visited by current patients who can share their experiences, he said.
FLEXIBILITY WITH PERITONEAL DIALYSIS
Among patients who are eligible for and opted for peritoneal dialysis at home is Mr Yusop Yacob.
The 70-year-old, who has been undergoing dialysis since August last year, uses a machine, typically for eight to 10 hours overnight.
""I'm like a robot, night time I'm charging myself, day time I'm fully charged and can walk around,” Mr Yusop quipped.
The process requires him to connect a tube to the abdomen and Mr Yusop and his wife had to attend a week-long training to be prepared for peritoneal dialysis.
Mr Yusop said he enjoys the freedom of undergoing treatment at home as opposed to haemodialysis.
“(For haemodialysis), rain or shine, you have to go to the centre, whereas this one, I can do it at home at my own time,” he told CNA.
Mr Oei urged people to take responsibility for their health.
Many times, patients who are eventually diagnosed with renal failure enter the healthcare system through the emergency department, after failing to heed the advice of doctors to seek medical attention early, he said.
“A lot of the illnesses we see were not addressed at a very early stage and that is the point where if you come to an A&E setting, you don't have much choice,” he said.
“NKF believes that early detection, understanding and even the understanding of the consequences of the illness will help us take more proactive action.”"
SMS hyperlinks from government agencies still necessary in certain circumstances: Shanmugam ,"Government agencies will only use a domain ending with "".gov.sg"" if they assess that it is necessary to send hyperlinks in SMSes.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sms-hyperlinks-government-agencies-still-necessary-certain-circumstances-shanmugam-2936641,"SINGAPORE: Hyperlinks in SMSes from government agencies are still necessary when providing public services in certain circumstances, such as mobilising citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19, said Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Sep 13).
To mitigate the risks, if the government agency assesses that it is necessary to send hyperlinks in SMSes, the agency will only use a domain ending with .gov.sg, said Mr Shanmugam. It will also not ask users to provide their credentials through websites accessed through the hyperlinks.
Mr Shanmugam was responding to a parliamentary question from NMP Shahira Abdullah, who asked about the removal of hyperlinks from SMSes, which are known to increase the risk of phishing.
The Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams (IMCS) will continue to study the use of hyperlinks in other sectors and work with sector partners to adjust their use if necessary, Mr Shanmugam wrote in his answer.
""As scammers may pivot to other communication channels, the removal of hyperlinks in SMSes does not eliminate the risk of users falling prey to phishing attempts. Users should continue to exercise vigilance,"" he added.
Earlier this year, the Government said it was reviewing its use of SMS and clickable links when communicating with members of the public.
This came after a spate of online banking scams, including an SMS phishing scam involving OCBC Bank that affected hundreds of people and saw them lose a total of about S$13.7 million.
Mr Shanmugam said the IMCS takes a ""sector-based, risk calibrated"" approach to the removal of hyperlinks in SMSes. 
""This is in consideration of the tradeoffs, between the risks of phishing and the facilitation of services, which hyperlinks enable,"" he added.
The inter-ministry committee has worked with the Association of Banks in Singapore to get banks to remove hyperlinks in SMSes sent to retail customers, said Mr Shanmugam, who is also Law Minister.

Anti-SMS spoofing registry shut and replaced by full-fledged system: IMDA



















IMDA proposes mandatory registration for organisations that use SMS sender IDs



















Government reviewing its use of SMS, clickable links to prevent phishing scams













To further secure SMSes from scams, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) implemented the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) in March this year.
Organisations including e-commerce companies that wish to protect their SMS sender IDs can register their sender ID with the registry. 
The registry reduces the risk of SMS phishing by blocking messages that use spoofed sender IDs of those already registered, said Mr Shanmugam.
Registering with the SSIR is currently voluntary, applicable only to organisations that register their sender ID.
""The public may therefore still receive phishing SMSes that spoof sender IDs belonging to organisations that are not on the SSIR, or that use sender IDs that do not belong to any organisation,"" said Mr Shanmugam. 
He added that IMDA is looking to make SSIR registration a requirement for all organisations that use sender IDs by the end of the year. SMSes with non-registered sender IDs will be blocked as a default.
IMDA is also looking to introduce anti-scam SMS solutions to filter out malicious hyperlinks and scam messages, applicable to all SMSes sent through telecommunication networks. 
These filters are designed to work like a security firewall, using automated machine scanning to filter out malicious hyperlinks and scam messages, said Mr Shanmugam."
Missing S$33 million case: Lawyer Jeffrey Ong struck off the rolls in disciplinary hearing,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/missing-33m-escrow-case-lawyer-jeffrey-ong-struck-law-society-jlc-advisors-2936676,"SINGAPORE: Lawyer Jeffrey Ong Su Aun, who faces multiple charges over S$33 million that went missing from a client's escrow fund, has been struck off the rolls in a disciplinary hearing sought by The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc).
Drew and Napier lawyers representing LawSoc said a striking off is the only appropriate sanction for Ong, saying his dishonesty and actions fall short of the integrity and trustworthiness expected of a solicitor.
The Court of Three Judges, comprising the Chief Justice as well as Justices Judith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang, agreed and ordered Ong to be struck off on Wednesday (Sep 14).
Ong was a solicitor of 15 years and the managing partner of JLC Advisors at the time. The firm was engaged to hold monies on escrow in its client's account. An escrow account is one where funds are held while two or more parties complete a transaction.
In a disciplinary tribunal, Ong admitted to all seven charges against him in relation to his failure to deal appropriately with the escrow account and money within.
On Wednesday, Drew and Napier lawyer Adam Maniam asked the court to strike Ong off the rolls. He said Ong's conduct was dishonest, not just on one occasion but on a number of occasions over a prolonged period.
This includes allowing funds in the escrow account to be paid out to parties other than the client without receiving the authorisation and without informing the client.
Ong admitted that he gave instructions for the issue of 15 escrow notices between November 2017 and January 2019 that did not state the true balance in the escrow account, said Mr Maniam.
""The false balances in these escrow notices meant that the fact that there were unauthorised transactions by (Ong) went undetected by the client until much later on in 2019, and again LawSoc's position is that this was dishonest conduct,"" he said.
Ong also sent a series of emails that gave the impression that the full amount of S$33 million would be released from the escrow account, even though he knew it could not be as there were insufficient funds.
""When a client places funds with a lawyer or law firm, there is a certain relationship there. The client will of course expect those funds to be protected and only dealt with in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement,"" said Mr Maniam.
""When this is not done and communications are done to mask the fact that funds have been paid out, our submission is that this clearly falls short of the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness expected of a solicitor.""
Ong was unrepresented. When asked to speak, he said he had no submissions.
""I agree with LawSoc's submission,"" he said via Zoom from his place of remand. ""While there were underlying reasons and circumstances surrounding the fact, I don't think those are relevant for these proceedings so I have no submissions to make on my part, I just apologise for taking up your honours' time, that's all.""
Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said there was ""no doubt at all"" that there was due cause for sanctions and that the only appropriate sanction was to strike Ong off.
Ong still faces pending criminal charges in the State Courts.
The hearing in the Court of Three Judges on Wednesday opened with Mr Maniam telling the judges that Ong's lawyer for the criminal case wanted to ""update"" the court a few minutes before the hearing began.
""She informed me that she acts for Mr Ong in some criminal proceedings and she says there are some material updates that she wishes to speak to Mr Ong about,"" said Mr Maniam. ""She asked if she could have 10 minutes to speak to him. I understand she is physically in the court, I told her there will be difficulties.""
The Chief Justice said: ""This is nothing to do with this matter (of disciplinary sanction) right.""
Mr Maniam agreed, as Ong was unrepresented for the case brought against him by LawSoc.
""I think she should know the (court) is not some kind of bus where you hop on and ask for a ride,"" Chief Justice Menon replied. The lawyer was not allowed to speak to Ong before the hearing."
"Employment in Q2 recovers to near pre-pandemic levels, but MOM warns of uncertainty ahead",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mom-labour-report-q2-employment-pre-covid-levels-uncertainty-ahead-2936601,"SINGAPORE: The labour market continued to improve in the second quarter of 2022, with total employment reaching 99.5 per cent of the level in December 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Labour Market Report on Wednesday (Sep 14).
Resident employment grew to 4.2 per cent above the pre-pandemic level in June. While non-resident employment remained 10 per cent below the pre-pandemic level, it increased significantly from the first quarter of the year following the relaxation of border restrictions.
However, the external demand outlook has weakened, given the economic slowdown. Global headwinds, such as the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions in the region, and the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, mean that the labour market outlook is uneven across sectors, said MOM.
""The labour market continued to make significant improvements in 2Q 2022 as Singapore recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there is heightened economic uncertainty ahead,"" said the ministry.
MOM permanent secretary Ng Chee Khern said that the job market remains tight but there are early signs of easing as recruitment has picked up.
""Amidst this uncertainty, we do need to press on with economic transformation and to enhance our businesses' and workers' resilience to shocks,"" said Mr Ng.
""Businesses could strengthen their Singaporean core through reskilling and offering flexible work arrangements to tap on more workforce segments such as older workers and caregivers.""
Tourism and aviation sectors are expected to continue to benefit from a strong recovery in air passengers and international visitor arrivals.
Demand in consumer-facing sectors, such as food and beverages services, should also remain robust with the easing of domestic and border restrictions, said MOM.
But growth in outward-oriented sectors like finance and insurance services is expected to slow due to the global headwinds.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
While non-resident employment is expected to rise further as it catches up to pre-pandemic levels, resident employment growth is likely to be more ""subdued"", said MOM.
The ministry added that the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people remains high and edged up from 2.42 in March to 2.53 in June. This is despite the number of job vacancies dipping slightly to 126,100 in June, after seven quarters of increases.
Responding to a reporter's question about whether the labour market tightness will persist, Mr Ng warned that one should ""be careful what you ask for"" and pointed out retrenchment exercises - giving the example of Food Panda - that made the news recently.
With the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, many people are expecting a recession in the United States, he said.
""The labour demand would ease sooner than you think and it may not necessarily be a good situation,"" said Mr Ng.
The growth in total employment in the first half, by 108,500 workers, was in large part due to foreign workers returning to Singapore, particularly in construction and manufacturing.
MOM said that non-resident employment rose across all pass types, with the bulk coming from work permit and other work passes, of which there were 80,900 more. There were 7,400 more S Pass holders and 7,100 more employment pass holders.
Resident employment also grew in the first half of the year, by 13,100, with the largest increases recorded in financial and insurance services, information and communications, and professional services.
Unemployment rates in July held steady at pre-pandemic levels of 2.1 per cent overall. Resident unemployment rate was at 2.9 per cent, and the citizen unemployment rate was 3 per cent.
The resident long-term unemployment rate declined for the third consecutive quarter, returning to the pre-pandemic average of 0.7 per cent in June.
RECORD LOW RETRENCHMENTS
Retrenchments fell to a record low, from 1,320 in the first quarter to 990 in the second quarter. The incidence of retrenchment also improved, from 0.6 per 1,000 employees to 0.5.
Among retrenched residents, the percentage who found work within six months after retrenchment fell from last quarter’s high – from 72 per cent to 66 per cent – but remained higher than the same period a year ago.
The number of employees placed on short work-week or temporary layoff declined from 670 in the first quarter of the year to 590 in the second quarter. The majority of these employees were placed on short work-week arrangements, with 20 laid off temporarily.
The Labour Market Report also showed that the recruitment rate rose to 2.6 per cent from 2.5 per cent in the previous quarter, while the resignation rate held steady at 1.7 percent.
The bulk of the job vacancies in June 2022 were from the construction and manufacturing sectors at 22 per cent. The growth sectors of information & communications, financial & insurance services, professional services and health & social services accounted for 31 per cent of vacancies.
For two sectors - information & communications and financial & insurance services - job vacancies have eased slightly from the highs of March this year, after trending up for five quarters. But job vacancies continued to rise in the professional services sector. The report highlighted the sector's positive outlook due to easing travel restrictions facilitating businesses’ overseas client engagements.
Another 17 per cent of the vacancies in June came from the consumer and tourism-related sectors of arts, entertainment & recreation, F&B services, accommodation, retail and air transport & supporting services.
Job vacancies in these rose at a faster pace, with increased demand for clerical, sales & service workers to meet greater business demand."
Sudden change in wind conditions contributed to Red Lions parachutist's hard landing at NDP: Ng Eng Hen,"Third Warrant Officer Jeffrey Heng had assessed that his parachute canopy was “unstable” and executed the parachute landing fall technique according to protocol, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wind-conditions-red-lions-hard-landing-ndp-2022-jeffrey-heng-ng-eng-hen-mindef-2935736,"SINGAPORE: A sudden change in wind conditions during a Red Lions team member’s final approach contributed to his hard landing at the National Day Parade.
This was according to preliminary findings by a review committee convened to assess the cause of the incident and past near-misses and cases, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in a written reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday (Sep 13).
Third Warrant Officer (3WO) Jeffrey Heng had assessed that his parachute canopy was “unstable” and executed the parachute landing fall technique according to existing protocol, he added in his reply to Member of Parliament Don Wee (PAP-Chua Chu Kang).
“His actions mitigated the impact of the hard landing, and consequently he did not suffer severe injuries,” he said.
At the parade last month, 3WO Heng was the last of 10 parachutists to land at the Marina Bay floating platform. He skidded on the pavement and fell to the ground.

Dr Ng said previously that the parachutist did not require surgery following the incident, but rehabilitation would be needed.
On Tuesday, Mr Wee had asked whether the ministry will consider reviewing the safety measures and criteria for suitable conditions for military demonstrations such as free fall jumps and parachute landings.
He also asked if the defence ministry will consider limiting such exercises to training operations only.
In his reply, Dr Ng also said that the measured surface wind speeds during the Red Lion rehearsals and National Day Parade were within the acceptable range stipulated in the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) safety regulations.
The review committee, which is led by the SAF Inspector-General Office, includes independent experts outside the SAF in sky diving and military freefall, he added.
“I have asked the committee why specific incidents like this have not occurred before, since changes in wind conditions cannot only have occurred for NDP 2022,"" he said.
""They are consulting the external experts on this specific question, as well as reviewing in detail the approach route taken by 3WO Heng."" 
Other issues that will be examined include the impact of eddy currents caused by the design of the Floating Platform, the stage and the spectator stands. An eddy is a whirl or circulation of air that is created when wind encounters a solid object.
“These findings will be relevant to the design and construction of the NS Square, which will be a permanent site for subsequent NDPs,” said Dr Ng.

RED LIONS A REGULAR FEATURE OF NDP
The Red Lions have been a regular feature of the National Day Parade since 1989, for 31 times over 34 years, said Dr Ng.
Of a total of about 3,400 individual parachute jumps, there have been four recorded injuries – a rate of 0.12 per cent.
“The safety record by our Red Lions during NDP is good and equivalent to that in regular military freefall training jumps - over the past five years, where the incident rate has also been about 0.1 per cent,"" he said.
As conditions during the National Day Parade pose tighter constraints due to challenging wind conditions and limited landing area, only experienced parachutists are selected as Red Lions for parade displays, said Dr Ng.
He added that parachutists must have made a minimum of 180 jumps to qualify for the selection tests.
Those who are selected will undergo continuous and rigorous training to maintain their skills and proficiency.
For jumps at the Floating Platform or HDB heartlands, landing sites are carefully selected. The areas must be flat and provide sufficient space. They must also be free from obstructions, and the wind conditions must be within safe thresholds, said Dr Ng.
There are also prescribed “No-Go Criteria” for jumps, which include prevailing visibility of the landing site by the parachutists, communications with the pilot and ground personnel, as well as acceptable weather and wind speed, the Defence Minister said in his reply.
Dr Ng also said that the committee reviewing the incident involving 3WO Heng is also looking into near-misses and incidents in the past.
The experts in the committee have been tasked to determine if there have been systemic changes such as stronger wind, other weather conditions or local environment which have increased the risks, Dr Ng said, adding that their findings will also have a bearing on routine training.
The committee is also examining possible measures to enhance safety, with an increase of the distance between parachutists among one of the changes being considered.
“This will provide the parachutists more reaction time as they approach the landing zone and enable the landing to be more spaced out,” said Dr Ng.
“The SAF’s priority is safety, and the Red Lions will continue to be a part of our NDP celebrations, only if safety can be ensured, with appropriate new measures, including those recommended by the review committee,” he added."

A four-day work week may work well for some employers and employees but not others, said Minister of State in the Manpower Ministry Gan Siow Huang in Parliament in response to a question on whether its feasibility was being studied.
She said the ministry ""strongly encourages employers and employees to be open to flexible work arrangements in all its various forms to identify and adopt those that best suit their unique business needs and their workers' needs"".
Citing pilots in other countries, she said that while four-day work weeks saw productivity improvements in some cases, this depends on the sector and job type.
Ms Gan added that the ministry does not intend impose formulas for flexible work arrangements on the public sector.
Najib hospitalised for fluctuating blood pressure; 1MDB trial postponed 
Najib Razak's 1MDB corruption trial has been postponed as the former prime minister has been hospitalised since Monday. His lawyer told the High Court on Tuesday that Najib's blood pressure has been fluctuating and he has to undergo several tests, which could take a few days.
His 1MDB trial was initially scheduled to take place from Monday to Thursday this week. The deputy public prosecutor did not object to the postponement, and the judge fixed Wednesday afternoon for mention to get an update on Najib’s condition.
Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin also denied allegations that Najib's medication had been switched, saying he was given the generic version of the same formulation.
Singapore spent S$72.3 billion to fight COVID-19 over past 2 years, lower than initially committed
S$72.3 billion was spent on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic over the last two financial years, said Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah in Parliament.
This was lower than the initial sum of S$100 billion that the Government committed, Ms Indranee said.
First, the Government had set aside loan capital in FY2020 in anticipation of a tight credit market, but this was not needed eventually. Secondly, resources set aside for public health capacity were not fully utilised, as safe management measures and the cooperation of Singaporeans helped to avert severe public health outcomes.
Ms Indranee also noted that this under-utilisation in funds was offset by the various support packages that were introduced over the heightened alerts and stabilisation phases from May to November 2021.
The Ministry of Finance has been auditing COVID-19-related procurement and expenditure since earlier this year, she added. 
StanChart robbery copycat who targeted moneylender while carrying auxiliary police gun gets jail, caning
A former AETOS auxiliary officer has been sentenced to 16 and a half years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane, after he pleaded guilty to three charges of robbery, unlawfully carrying a revolver and unlawful possession of ammunition.
Facing mounting debts, Mahadi Muhamad Mukhtar decided to rob a moneylender and took his loaded revolver with him while he was supposed to be covering a colleague's shift.
He decided to copy the approach taken by Standard Chartered robber James Roach, wrote a note saying he had a gun and stating his demands, and handed it to the credit loan officer on duty. 
Fearing for her life, she hit the panic button under the table before complying and putting the money inside his sling bag.
Comparing the case with the Standard Chartered robbery, the prosecution said that Roach was bluffing, as he had no weapon on him, but Mahadi was not bluffing.
The judge said he found that the harm disclosed in this case was substantial, given that Mahadi had armed himself with a loaded revolver capable of inflicting serious harm on others."
Nightclub operator manipulated sales of flower garlands; jailed for GST evasion and money laundering,"The garlands, bought by customers for performing artists, cost between S$50 and S$100,000.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nightclub-operator-club-posh-west-palace-entertainment-evade-gst-money-laundering-jailed-penalty-2935436,"SINGAPORE: A nightclub operator was jailed and penalised more than S$630,000 on Tuesday (Sep 13) after he was convicted of Goods and Services Tax (GST) evasion and money laundering offences.
Soon Kok Khoon, the operator of Club Posh Entertainment and West Palace Entertainment, was found to have helped the clubs make false entries in their GST returns “with wilful intent"" to evade the tax, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) said in a joint news release.
He was convicted of three counts of GST evasion and ordered to pay a penalty of S$630,861, three times the S$210,287 in GST he evaded. Another five charges were taken into consideration during the sentencing.
In addition, Soon was found guilty of three counts of money laundering involving the disguise of property amounting to S$3,214,389. Five other charges were also taken into consideration for the sentencing.
He received a jail term of more than 13 months for his offences.
USING SHELL ENTITIES TO DIVERT REVENUE
In 2016, Soon instructed accountants at Club Posh Entertainment and West Palace Entertainment to omit reporting the clubs’ sales revenue, mainly from the sale of flower garlands, as well as the output tax.
Customers would buy these flower garlands, priced between S$50 and S$100,000, at the clubs. The garlands would then be delivered to performing artists identified by the customer after payment.
Soon also instructed his staff to divert the sales revenue of the clubs, which were GST-registered, to two shell entities using separate point-of-sale terminals linked to them, said SPF and IRAS.

“These shell entities were not GST-registered and had no actual business activities,” they added.
The undeclared revenue from the sales of the flower garlands was recorded as proceeds from fictitious sales of souvenirs in the accounts of these shell entities.
“By doing so, Soon had thereby disguised money which, in part, directly represented the benefits of his criminal conduct from GST evasion,” the authorities said.





      HOW SOON HELPED FALSIFY THE CLUBS' TAX RETURNS
  

The two clubs, which were GST-registered, made taxable supplies of flower garlands to customers. The garlands were delivered to performing artists identified by the customers after they were paid for.
The price of the flower garlands ranged from S$50 to $100,000. For customers who used their credit cards to pay, Soon instructed his staff to swipe the cards using the point-of-sale terminals linked to the two shell entities. These entities were not GST-registered. 
Revenue amounts and GST output tax of the flower garlands were omitted from the clubs' GST returns even though the items were taxable. 
Money collected through credit cards or cash for the garlands were not deposited in the clubs' bank accounts. The clubs neither issued receipts for the sales of the garlands nor recorded them in the clubs' accounts. 
As the garlands were ""charged"" to the point-of-sale terminals of the shell entities, Soon instructed his staff to falsely record the taxable supplies as ""sale of souvenirs"" of the shell entities. 
Soon also told his employees to understate the ""sale of souvenirs"" in the shell entities' accounting books to avoid hitting the GST registration threshold.

Those who are found guilty of wilfully submitting false GST returns by overstating any input tax, understating any output tax or including fictitious transactions could be penalised three times the amount of tax undercharged, fined no more than S$10,000 and/or jailed for up to seven years.
Anyone who acquires, possesses, uses, conceals or transfers benefits from criminal conduct could be fined up to S$500,000, jailed up to 10 years, or both, if convicted.
The authorities encouraged businesses or individuals to immediately disclose any past tax mistakes, adding that IRAS will treat such disclosures as mitigating factors when considering actions to be taken."
Debt collectors to be licensed after Bill passed in Parliament,"The Debt Collection Bill seeks to better manage debt collection activities in Singapore, following a rise in complaints from the public.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/debt-collection-licence-regulations-bill-passed-parliament-police-2935381,"SINGAPORE: Debt collectors will soon have to apply for a licence and be subject to regulations after a Bill was passed in Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
The Debt Collection Bill seeks to better manage debt collection activities in Singapore, following a rise in complaints from the public.
Standards will be set for debt collection companies, and errant businesses and debt collectors will be taken to task.
Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling, who tabled the Bill, said that the number of police reports lodged against debt collection businesses and debt collectors regarding their conduct has remained high.
An average of 367 reports were lodged each year from 2018 to 2021.
""The reports were mainly against debt collection tactics aimed at pressuring debtors into payment by causing public embarrassment and inconvenience to them,"" Ms Sun said. 
She recalled a 2019 case which made headlines after a debt collector dressed in funeral clothes to harass a debtor. The debt collector had carried a banner with the debtor’s face, a funeral lantern and incense paper while chanting, shouting and kneeling outside the debtor's workplace. 
""Debt collection is a legitimate economic activity that facilitates the fulfilment of financial obligations. However, individuals and businesses should not be subjected to debt collection methods that clearly exceed what may be considered reasonable pressure for payment, especially if these methods also affect the public’s sense of safety and security,"" said Ms Sun.

GUIDELINES ON IMPROPER DEBT COLLECTION BEHAVIOUR
Members of Parliaments (MPs) welcomed the Bill as “timely” but sought clarifications on its scope, such as whether the Bill would set out what is considered improper debt collection behaviour.
MPs Yip Hong Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang), Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied), Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) and Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) asked if there were clearer regulations defining which methods were unacceptable.
Ms Foo said a code of practice would be useful ""to prescribe a clear set of lawful practices”.
“It should contain clear rules of what is and what is not allowable, in order to provide debt collectors with a clear framework within which to operate, and I think as well as to educate debtors on their rights,” she added.
Mr Chua raised an example of a debt collection agency that livestreamed its process of demanding repayment and uploaded videos exposing debtors' faces online.
To this, Ms Sun reiterated that the Government would introduce regulations prohibiting behaviour that threatened the physical safety of the debtor or any other third parties.
""Livestreaming of debt collection activities in and of itself is not an offence unless it crosses the threshold for other criminal offences such as the Protection from Harassment Act,"" she added.
On whether there will be a code of practice, Ms Sun said that since there are regulations to guide the conduct of debt collection businesses and their collectors, the ministry does not intend to issue a code of practice for now.
In response to Mr Tan’s question about additional regulations, Ms Sun said that the ministry does not have plans to introduce regulations on prohibited debt collection conduct outside of those stated in the Ministry of Home Affair’s public consultation paper.
The paper's debt collection rules and offences for individuals state that a debt collector must not display or use physically threatening words, behaviour, or display notices about debts outside the debtors' property, among other regulations.
MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok), asked for the “rules of engagement” in the event of disputes between debtors and collectors.
Ms Sun responded that debt collectors will be required to ensure that there is a proper contract detailing the terms of appointment by the creditor, the debt amount, the payment schedule and the debtor’s identity, in order to minimise disputes.
In cases where victims’ identities are misused by impersonators to borrow money, debt collectors will be required to verify the identity of the subjects they collect from against the contract.
“The debt collection regulations will also prohibit debt collectors from continuing to collect debt from a debtor if the debtor has informed the debt collection business or collector that the debt is in dispute, or that the debtor has initiated a process to settle the debt through other means (such as mediation or court proceedings),” said Ms Sun.

DEFINING “FIT AND PROPER”
Several MPs also raised questions about how debt collection companies and their employees will be deemed “fit and proper” to be issued a licence.
Under the new licensing regime, debt collectors must be assessed by the police who will consider past offences committed under a range of laws, such as the Organised Crime Act and the Vandalism Act. The licensing officer may also consider “any other matter or evidence that may be relevant”.
MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) described the current provisions as “broad” and asked for examples that may be used to determine if someone is “fit” to be a debt collector. Echoing similar concerns, Mr Chua said it is important to have regulatory clarity so as to avoid instances of unfair discrimination.
Mr Perera suggested that firms be allowed to provide testimonials on behalf of their existing employees who might fail the approval process due to previous convictions, and that “adequate” resources be put in place to hear such appeals.
He also urged authorities to consider other factors, such as the company’s record and years of experience, in the decision process.
In her response, Ms Sun said that apart from past offences, the licensing officer will also consider the severity of these offences and the length of time that has passed since then. She added that these considerations are similar to those used for security officers.
On the issue of ensuring opportunities for ex-offenders, Ms Sun said the licensing officer will consider “circumstances on a case-by-case basis”.

PUBLIC EDUCATION
MPs also raised the importance of educating the public about the new laws and having a proper channel for reporting incidents.
Mr Tan, who urged authorities to look into a public education campaign, said public awareness will help to “reduce … unnecessary intimidation and harassment” and better enable people to report errant practices so that proper action can be taken.
Ms Sun replied that information on this new regulatory regime will be published on the police's website, while authorities will study Mr Tan’s suggestion to hold a public education campaign.
Currently, members of the public may lodge a police report about errant debt collection activities, either online or at a police station. “If immediate police assistance is required, they should contact the police at 999,” she said.
MPs like Mr Yip and Mr Perera also stressed the need to ramp up public education on borrowing and debt, as well as “risky” retail financial products such as some cryptocurrency products. 
They also asked if community legal clinics are adequately equipped to help residents with relevant concerns, and whether credit counselling and debt restructuring services can be made more widely available, among others.
Ms Sun replied that these questions and feedback are beyond the scope of the new Bill, but given their “close nexus with debt collection”, they will be passed on to the relevant agencies to be studied separately."
"WP calls for BTO eligibility age for singles to be lowered, boost in HDB flat supply","In an adjournment motion, Workers’ Party MP Louis Chua asked the Government to take “urgent and decisive steps” to increase the availability of HDB housing.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-bto-flats-singles-age-lower-28-workers-party-parliament-2935346,"SINGAPORE: Workers’ Party Member of Parliament Louis Chua on Tuesday (Sep 13) made a case for lowering the age at which Singaporean singles can apply for a new Housing Board (HDB) flat to 28, while urging the Government to up the supply of public housing for all.
Mr Chua (WP-Sengkang), made the calls in an adjournment motion on “Ensuring Housing Needs of Singles and Singaporeans are Met” in Parliament.
He said that while public housing options for singles have gradually expanded since 1991, when the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme was introduced, one key policy requirement has remained unchanged – that singles must be at least 35 years old to be eligible to purchase public housing. He called for age eligibility to apply for Built-to-Order (BTO) flats to be lowered to 28.
“This proposal would be a critical change, yet a continuation of the Government’s efforts over the years to expand HDB options for singles, while still allowing HDB to give priority to providing for families,” said Mr Chua. 
“In fact, we believe lowering the threshold for owning HDB flats to 28 years would go a long way towards HDB’s stated aims for Singapore’s public housing to be ‘inclusive’ and to ‘reflect the diversity of our society’.”
However, a more pressing issue at the moment is the inadequate housing supply, he said.
“I would like to implore the Government to take urgent and decisive steps to increase the availability of public housing and address the current demand-supply imbalance, to ensure that the housing demand of all Singaporeans, not just singles, can be met,” said Mr Chua.

Strong demand for larger flats in August BTO exercise, with Tampines units most popular













Mr Chua said that BTO flat application rates have climbed over the past decade to new highs.
For three-room and larger flats, this increased from 2.8 times in 2012 to 6.1 times in 2021. For two-room flexi flats, whose buyers are more likely to be the elderly or singles, application rates rose from 2.8 times in 2012 to 3.6 times in 2021, he said.
Despite the ramp-up in flat supply this year, application rates have reached new record highs, he added.
“While I acknowledge that our proposal on singles’ BTO eligibility could increase marginal demand for two-room flexi flats, it does not detract from the fact that there appears to be serious imbalances in the housing market,” he said, adding that the “spill-over effects” of this are higher HDB resale prices.
LOWER AGE TO APPLY FOR BTOS
On why the BTO eligibility age for singles should be lowered to 28, Mr Chua said that by that age, most Singaporeans would have had some chance to ""lead independent lives and steady their financial footing"".
Citing the National Youth Council’s 2021 publication on the state of youths in Singapore, Mr Chua said that when it comes to aspirations or life goals, the top choice of youths here was to maintain strong family relationships while the second choice was ""to have a place of my own"".
“While it is abundantly clear that many Singaporeans who may be single for various reasons before the age of 35 would like to have a place of their own, many simply cannot afford to do so,” he said.
“Should we not look into further enabling single Singaporeans to meet their housing needs and aspirations?""
The WP proposes to reduce the BTO eligibility age to 28, and not that for the resale market, said Mr Chua so that the incremental demand is met through new supply and not through existing supply and via the currently ""buoyant"" HDB resale market.
He said that with a waiting time of up to 5.7 years as of the August 2022 BTO launch, a single who successfully ballots for a BTO flat at age 28, would already be close to 35 years old by the time he or she can move in to the flat.
He also touched on grants for flat buyers, saying that single buyers are not eligible for the range of housing grants available to married couples.
If the Government has budgetary concerns or believe that younger singles should not given incentives to buy a place of their own, the level of housing grants can be on a “graduated scale”, he said.
""DEFAULT"" THRESHOLD OF AGE 35 
In 1991, singles over 35 were allowed to buy resale HDB flats but limited to three-room flats in selected locations. The rules were further relaxed over the years, and in 2013, singles over 35 were allowed to buy new, subsidised two-room flats from the HDB.
Mr Chua said that these developments showed that the Government can be responsive to the changing demographics of society, but the general threshold of excluding singles below 35 years old seems to have been “retained by default” since 1991. This is despite changing demographics and societal mindsets.
Mr Chua said that the policy was based on the implicit expectation that Singaporeans should get married before turning 35 years old, and will live with their parents before marriage. But Singaporeans are now staying single for longer for various reasons, and not moving straight from their parents’ home into a matrimonial home, he said.
“This rule has serious implications on the growing number of singles under 35, depriving them of the security of home ownership if they are priced out of the private market, the private and HDB rental market and not having a place of their own and build their own lives,” he said.

                           hr 
                












This is as Singaporeans choose to marry later, and the proportion of singles among citizens in the 30-34 years age group is now at a record high of 42.2 per cent in 2021, increasingly steadily from 27.6 per cent in 2000 and 36.9 per cent in 2010, said Mr Chua.
Meanwhile more singles are moving out before getting married. Between 2017 to 2020, the number of people below 35 years old and living alone has almost doubled from 12,300 to 25,000, said Mr Chua. 
The data and trends highlight the “negative effects” of excluding those under the age of 35 from owning HDB flats, he said, but adding that the housing needs of families should still be prioritised.
Mr Chua pointed out that singles do not compete with young couples and families for the same type of HDB flats in non-mature estates, as they are limited to buying two-room flexi BTO flats.
He said: “We are in full agreement that public housing policy should provide extra support and incentives to young couples and budding families. 
“Having said that, providing support for young couples and families should not be viewed as mutually exclusive from expanding HDB options for singles.”
GOVERNMENT ""KEENLY AWARE"" HOUSING ASPIRATIONS CHANGE
Responding to Mr Chua’s proposals, Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How assured the House that ensuring affordable and accessible housing for Singaporeans has always been an important priority for the Government.
He said that the Government is “keenly aware” that housing preferences and aspirations change over time, and across different life stages of families and individuals. 
This is why the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the HDB have been actively engaging Singaporeans to understand their needs and aspirations, said Mr Tan. 
As part of a recent year-long Long-Term Planning Review, authorities heard from more than 15,000 people.
“We received many valuable feedback and suggestions, some of which are quite similar to what Mr Chua raised today, and we are studying those suggestions carefully,” he said.
“We would want to meet the needs of all Singaporeans ... their aspirations and their wants if we can. But we have limited land and resources and would have to prioritise and allocate within these constraints.”
Mr Tan said that MND is already taking steps to address the concerns raised by various groups, such as by ramping up flat supply, and the ministry is monitoring the situation to see if other measures are needed.
He pointed out that while application rates for HDB flats have increased, four in 10 applicants did not choose a flat when invited to do so.
""So we are monitoring the situation, both the supply, the interest, the application rates and the locations where the application rates are elevated,"" he said.
For singles, Mr Tan said HDB has expanded housing options for them. Since singles were allowed to bid for two-room BTO flats in 2013, the quota allotted to them has increased over the years. 
Mr Tan added that as part of the Forward Singapore exercise, MND will be engaging Singaporeans on their housing needs and aspirations, and urged Singaporeans to participate and give their views.
""I would like to assure Singaporeans that even as we engage all of you as part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we have already taken steps to address the concerns raised by various demographic groups and various segments of Singaporeans."""
Singapore to allow national flag to be displayed more often; raises penalty for misuse,"Four more national symbols have been recognised under a new Bill.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-flag-symbols-misuse-penalty-anthem-pledge-lion-head-vanda-miss-joaquim-2935236,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore flag can be displayed more often, including potentially outside the National Day period, after a Bill was passed in Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
It comes after feedback from the public to allow greater flexibility in the use of the national symbols during various consultation exercises conducted over the last two years.
The National Symbols Bill replaces the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (SAFNA) Act, which was enacted in 1959 to govern the use of Singapore's state crest, national flag and national anthem.
Speaking in Parliament, Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Low Yen Ling said Singaporeans have increasingly sought to use the flag and other national symbols to show their national pride and solidarity in ways not anticipated by the 1959 rules.
“Over the past two years since COVID-19, we have seen how Singaporeans used national symbols like the flag as an expression of our solidarity in challenging times,” she said, noting that the Government had amended SAFNA Act rules to allow the flag to be displayed outside the typical National Day period, which is from July to September.
Under the new Bill, the President can make regulations on the use of national and presidential symbols while a prescribed person such as the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth can permit or prohibit the use of national symbols in appropriate situations.
This will allow for greater flexibility, said Ms Low.
""With these new regulations, we can respond more nimbly to legitimate requests to use the national symbols under pre-specified conditions, while also protecting the national symbols from indiscriminate or inappropriate use,” she said.
""We envisage that the new regulations could take a more permissive stance to allow greater artistic and creative use of an image of the Singapore flag,"" she added.
MORE NATIONAL SYMBOLS
The national pledge, the national flower Vanda Miss Joaquim, the lion head symbol and the public seal - which is affixed to important documents of state - will also now be recognised as national symbols.
In addition, three presidential symbols - the presidential standard, presidential crest and presidential seal - will be given statutory recognition and protection.
Among the four newly recognised national symbols, the national pledge and public seal will come under statutory safeguards. No new regulations are intended for the national flower or lion head symbol, said Ms Low.
""We will continue our practice today of allowing any individual, organisation or company to use the lion head symbol for purposes of identifying with the nation, following prevailing guidelines.
""Individuals, organisations and companies are also free to use the image of the national flower,"" said Ms Low.

TOUGHER PENALTIES
The new Bill also raises maximum penalties for misusing the national symbols to half a year in prison, a S$30,000 fine or both, up from the current maximum S$1,000 fine.
Ms Low said the new penalty amount takes into account the maximum penalties set for similar offences, noting that it had not been updated since 1959.
She added that more egregious offences such as the burning or desecration of the national flag would attract higher penalties.
In August, a 39-year-old man was arrested for burning National Day decorations. Last year, a 24-year-old man was charged with cutting and damaging multiple National Day Parade banners.
 
Member of Parliament (MP) Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) suggested enhancing penalties for those who misuse the National Symbols to mislead others.
He cited the example of investment scammers who had used Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC's logo to trick Singaporeans into transferring money to them.
""Our national symbols are not only a source of identity. They also carry the Singapore brand, signifying the trust and reliability we are known for,"" he said.
""Almost every day we are seeing new attempts to scam Singaporeans or spread false information, with a large variety of creative tactics,"" he added.
Meanwhile, MP Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) said that instead of using ""heavy-handed legal means"" to seek respect for the country’s national symbols, the Government should inspire citizens with what Singapore is and what it can be.
He added that he hopes the authorities will take a light touch in enforcing the provisions of this law, by showing compassion and taking into account the individual circumstances associated with each offence.
MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) said what constitutes misuse of national symbols should be clearly communicated, and urged enforcement officers to be understanding of ""genuine mistakes"".
Responding to MPs, Ms Low said the ministry intended to provide for stop orders under the Bill that could be issued against the disrespectful use of national symbols, with failure to comply constituting an offence.
She added that in practice, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and National Heritage Board would not impose penalties as a first course of action, and that their approach would be to educate and inform the public.
""We aim to strike a good balance between giving Singaporeans the latitude to use the national symbols creatively, and ensuring due respect for them,"" said Ms Low."
ERP rates to go up by S$1 at several expressway locations to ease congestion,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/erp-rates-increased-lta-congestion-cte-aye-2935196,"SINGAPORE: Electronic road pricing (ERP) rates will go up by S$1 from Sep 19 at five expressway locations, including southbound CTE after Braddell Road and the AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city.
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Tuesday (Sep 13) that ""traffic has built up at various stretches of expressways"" in August 2022.
“To manage congestion at these locations, ERP rates will be adjusted by S$1 with effect from Sep 19 at the following five locations during the five specific time periods,” LTA said.
The last time ERP rates were raised was in July, at four expressway locations, three of which are involved in the latest revision.
Three gantries for AYE after Jurong Town Hall towards the city will see rates rise to S$3 for the timeslot between 5.30pm and 6pm, after an earlier raise in July.
The sets of gantries at Southbound CTE after Braddell Road and PIE Slip Road into Southbound CTE, and Northbound CTE after PIE will also see adjusted rates for the second time in a row, but for different timeslots.
The Southbound CTE gantries will incur S$4 rates from motorists travelling between 8.30am and 9am, the highest of any gantry along the expressway.
In July, rates at these gantries were raised to S$3 between 8am and 8.30am after COVID-19 measures were relaxed, allowing more employees to return to the workplace.
Rates at the set of two gantries at Northbound CTE after PIE will be raised to S$1 from 7.30pm to 8pm, after previously being free for motorists to pass.
Rates for the previous half-hour starting at 7pm were raised to S$2 in July.











Rates for other previously announced timeslots and gantries remain unchanged, LTA said.
""With these adjustments, the number of locations and timeslots charged is still significantly lower than the number charged pre-COVID,"" it added.
LTA said that it will continue to monitor traffic speeds and congestion levels closely and assess if ERP rates need to be adjusted further."
Director of car companies who cheated banks gets jail in S$14m trade financing case,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/frankel-motor-director-jailed-car-trade-financing-cheat-banks-court-2935111,"SINGAPORE: A director of several car trade-related companies ran a million-dollar scheme deceiving banks into issuing financing by using false documentation of transactions, resulting in massive losses by the banks.
Ho Yik Fuh, 57, was sentenced to 15 years' jail on Tuesday (Sep 13) for an assortment of charges including cheating and falsifying documents.
His accomplice and supplier, 61-year-old Yeo Kee Siah, was sentenced to 40 months' jail for his role.
Both men had contested the charges and were found guilty at close of trial.
The court heard that Ho ran Frankel Motor, Frankel Leasing and Supreme Motor, operating a parallel import car retailing business through these companies.
Yeo was a director in Blue Motor Works, a supplier of parallel imported cars to Ho's Frankel group of companies.
Ho had an arrangement with Ho such that most of the cars imported into Singapore by Yeo were parked at Frankel Motor's storage facilities. The storekeeper of Frankel Motor would take over the cars and receive one key for each car.
Under this arrangement, even though Frankel Motor had not formally purchased the cars, the company could offer the cars for sale to their customers.
If the cars were sold, Yeo would be informed and earmark the cars in his records as having been booked by Frankel Motor. Yeo would issue invoices for the cars booked by Frankel Motor depending on whether any of the companies in the Frankel group had available credit in its lines of financing with the banks.
To finance the Frankel group of companies, Ho applied for various loans from different banks and companies. Among these were the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), VTB Bank Europe Plc, Bank of East Asia (BEA) and GE Money.
To obtain financing from these banks, various documents had to be submitted, including documents showing evidence that cars were delivered to one of the Frankel group's companies, or that the company had to pay its supplier for the cars.
Between 2006 and 2007, Ho and Yeo deceived banks into giving financing to the Frankel group of companies for the purchase of cars from various suppliers, when in fact there were no cars delivered in accordance with the invoices and delivery notes provided to the banks.
Ho deceived three banks by using double financing - getting financing twice for the same goods - and post-dated financing, by using documents showing that the cars were delivered on a certain date when in fact they had been delivered some time before.
Yeo helped Ho by issuing documents to facilitate both types of financing.
""The fraud perpetrated on the three banks resulted in massive losses, as the Frankel group of companies went under and could not make repayment of the outstanding loans,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi.
""The banks were also left out of pocket, as the double financing and post-dated financing meant that the loans, which were supposed to have been secured by floating charges over the cars which should still have been within the assets of the Frankel group of companies, were in fact unsecured as the underlying cars had already been sold to end-buyers or were already under other financing which took precedence,"" he said.
The total amount in Ho's charges is about S$14.2 million. Of this, Yeo's involvement is at about S$3.5 million.
VTB was deceived into disbursing S$2.7 million, OCBC was cheated into disbursing S$1.09 million and BEA disbursed about S$659,000.
Ho also cheated Wirana Worldwide into entering a financing arrangement for Frankel Motor over non-existent imported cars. Losses of approximately S$9.7 million was caused to Wirana Worldwide over 29 instances of financing.
The prosecutor said the offences are a reflection of ""a troubling, yet persistent, climate in the Singapore business community where trade financing scams are seen as a convenient way to tide businesses through cashflow problems""."
Rise in public transport operating costs not matched by revenue growth: Iswaran,"Operating costs went up by an average of 7% a year from 2012 to 2021, said the Transport Minister.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/public-transport-operating-costs-revenue-s-iswaran-2934876,"SINGAPORE: Between 2012 and 2021, operating costs for public transport in Singapore went up annually by an average of 7 per cent, an increase that was not matched by revenue growth, said Transport Minister S Iswaran in Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
As a result, government subsidies have been increasing, he added.
The Government currently subsidises public transport services by more than S$2 billion annually, or S$1 for every journey, said Mr Iswaran. It has also committed more than S$60 billion to expand and renew the rail network over the next decade.
Mr Iswaran was responding to MP Liang Eng Hua (PAP-Bukit Panjang) who had asked how the Government determines the current annual amount of public transport subsidies, and whether it will consider reviewing this amount in light of rising costs.
Bus and train fares in Singapore went up by up to 4 cents at the end of December last year, as operating costs increased and ridership fell, the Public Transport Council said when it announced the fare hikes, the first in two years.

Bus, train fares to increase by up to 4 cents from Dec 26: Public Transport Council













Mr Iswaran pointed out that pre-COVID, Singaporeans took about 8 million trips daily on public transport.
""A reliable, convenient and affordable public transport system is essential to ensuring connectivity in our densely populated city. It also boosts economic activity, reduces road congestion and emissions, contributing to sustainability and the liveability of our city,"" he added.
""Over the last decade, we also steadily enhanced the public transport system, with attendant increases in cost. Commuters benefitted from a 40 per cent expansion of the rail network, 80 new bus services, reduced peak hour waiting times for basic bus services from 30 to 15 minutes, as well as significant improvements in rail reliability from 67,000 to over 1 million mean kilometres between failures.""
As with other subsidised services, the Government has to consider the best way to share costs between users and taxpayers - present and future - said Mr Iswaran.
He outlined three aspects to this.
Firstly, the Government will continue to fully fund the expansion of public transport infrastructure, he said, describing this as “large, lumpy expenditures”.
Secondly, it must find ways to economise and get ""value for money"".
“This requires a comprehensive approach – from efficient procurement by LTA (Land Transport Authority), and productivity-focused operations by public transport operators, to optimising the provision of bus and rail services even as we grow the overall network to serve new residential areas,"" said Mr Iswaran. ""Ultimately, we have to deploy our finite resources in a manner that best serves all Singaporeans.""

Public Transport Council starts review of the way bus, train fare adjustments are calculated













And finally, the Government has a fare formula to ensure that commuters pay a ""fair share"" of the costs, by accounting for key cost drivers for public transport – wages, energy, and inflation, said Mr Iswaran.
Last month, it was announced that a review of the formula and mechanism for adjusting public transport fares is under way, with the process likely to be completed by the first half of next year.
""We will continue to work with public transport operators to ensure judicious cost management. The fare formula is being reviewed to ensure robustness and relevance, in light of changes in the industry and commuting patterns,"" said Mr Iswaran.
""As we continue to expand the public transport network, and operating costs rise with inflation and other cost drivers, we will continue to seek an optimal balance between fiscal sustainability of Government spending on public transport and ensuring affordability of public transport fares, especially for the vulnerable segments of our society."""
Man with history of theft convictions jailed 6 weeks for stealing cans of Coca-Cola,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-steal-3-cans-coca-cola-minimart-jailed-6-weeks-2934896,"SINGAPORE: A jobless man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Tuesday (Sep 13) for stealing three cans of Coca-Cola from a minimart.
Jeswindar Singh Dilbara Singh, 61, pleaded guilty to one count of theft.
The court heard that Singh was walking past a minimart in Bukit Merah on the morning of Aug 26 this year when he decided to steal some beverages.
He pulled open the fridge door and took three cans of Coca-Cola without paying for them.
Later that morning, the owner of the shop was preparing for business when his wife noticed that the fridge door was slightly ajar.
The couple watched their closed-circuit television camera footage and saw Singh stealing three cans of Coca-Cola valued at S$3 from the fridge. They later called the police. 
Singh was identified using police camera footage and he was arrested that same day. The police raided his flat and recovered two cans of Coca-Cola from his fridge. The cans were returned to the minimart.
The third can had already been consumed by Singh, and he did not make any restitution, the prosecutor said.
For the offence of theft, he could have been jailed up to seven years and fined.
Singh has a history of offences dating back to 1977 when he was first convicted of house-breaking and fraudulent possession of property.
More recently, he was found guilty of theft and voluntarily causing hurt in 2012, theft in dwelling and rash act in 2019 and theft in dwelling in 2020."
MOE prepared to work with social service agencies to explore new models for special education schools,"A new model for special education schools must deliver better outcomes for children and their families, says Education Minister Chan Chun Sing.  
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/special-education-schools-sped-new-model-social-service-agencies-teachers-retention-chan-chun-sing-2934921,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) is prepared to work with social service agencies and the community to explore different models for special education schools, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Sep 14). 
He was responding to a question from Nominated Member of Parliament Dr Shahira Abdullah about whether the authorities would consider having all special education school teachers come under the ministry so that they can receive the benefits of being an MOE teacher. 
There are currently 22 special education (SPED) schools led by 12 social service agencies.
While full funding is provided for SPED schools, the social service agencies have autonomy in matters such as the hiring of staff. SPED teachers are currently not directly employed by the Education Ministry but some teachers may be seconded from the ministry to the schools.
“I’m prepared to work with my staff, the SSAs (social service agencies) and the community to explore different and new models. But I would set up five conditions for us to consider as to whether a new model is better and more appropriate,” said Mr Chan. 
The new model must deliver better outcomes for children and better support their families, he said as he laid out the five conditions. 
The model must also provide better training opportunities and professional development for SPED teachers, said Mr Chan. 
If implemented, the new model must be able to “engage the community to participate and partake in the endeavour”, and allow for a better continuum of care and support from pre-school, to school, to a post-school environment, he said. 
“So we’re prepared to explore new models with the SSAs and the community so long as we bear in mind these five criteria that I’ve just laid out, and I’ll be happy to have these conversations with the SSAs and our community partners on how we can take the SPED sector forward as part of our Forward Singapore exercise,” said the Education Minister. 
ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT
Mr Chan also noted that MOE has been working with special education schools to put in place progressive HR frameworks to support teacher retention and career development.
This includes increasing the number of key personnel positions in special education schools, to provide good-performing SPED teachers with opportunities to advance their careers, he added. 
To support this, SPED schools will receive additional funding for manpower costs in two tranches - one was rolled out in 2021 and the next one is planned for 2024, said Mr Chan. 
“To receive the second funding tranche, SPED schools will need to implement more progressive HR practices and the corresponding increases in SPED teacher salaries,” he added. 
“SPED schools will determine the salary adjustments for their teachers at different levels based on performance and current salary structures.”

Special education teachers hope to see salaries reviewed after pay bump for MOE teachers













MOE launched the Journeys of Excellence Package in 2020 with the aim of strengthening professionalism in SPED, said the Education Minister. 
The package also recognises the years of experience and service of many SPED educators by “placing them at appropriate competency levels” and raising the job size of senior SPED teachers to “more closely align” to those of equivalent MOE teachers, he added. 
PLANNING FORWARD FOR SPED NEEDS
Together with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), MOE plans to increase the number of SPED schools, said Mr Chan in response to a supplementary question from MP Carrie Tan (PAP-Nee Soon). 
“In planning for a SPED school, the manpower needs are not as straightforward as a conventional school, because in a conventional school, the needs are perhaps more homogenous,” he added. 
But in a SPED school, different children have different types of needs of differing severities, he noted. 
“We do have certain planning ratios, but we certainly will need and would like to recruit more Singaporeans to join the SPED sector. Today, we do rely quite a bit on some foreign manpower,” said the Education Minister. 
Stressing that working with children who need SPED support is emotionally demanding, Mr Chan said: “It’s not easy. I have given guidance to my staff that we cannot just plan on the basis of how many staff we need for how many children. We need to have a bit of a buffer … for us to be able to roster our people to go for training and also sometimes for them to take a break.” 
MOE and MSF are also working closely with “the most difficult challenge”, which is the continuum of care from pre-school, to school to post-school, or care and work arrangements for the SPED community after they turn 18, said Mr Chan. 
The Government can make plans based on the data on children who ended SPED as they emerge in pre-school, he added. 
This means MOE should be able to plan for what they may need after they turn 18 and leave the school system, said Mr Chan. “And we really want to do this much better,” he added. 
“Our current gap, the biggest gap in my view, is not so much the pre-school and the school system, which we have invested a lot of effort over the years, we can still do better,” said the Education Minister. 
“Our next lap, the biggest gap will be how we provide the continuum from the school system to the post-18-year-old arrangement so that we can better support the SPED community, including the caregivers who will always be worried about what will happen to their special needs children when they are no longer around.”"
"Singapore spent S$72.3 billion to fight COVID-19 over past 2 years, lower than initially committed","The total expenditure was lower than the initial sum of S$100 billion committed by the Government due to reasons such as under-utilisation of resources set aside previously to cater for “potential downside scenarios” in public health.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-spent-s723-billion-fight-covid-19-past-two-years-2934946,"SINGAPORE: A total of S$72.3 billion was spent on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic over the last two financial years (FY), said Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah in Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
Of this sum, S$13.4 billion went to public health measures. Another S$50.6 billion was directed towards support measures for workers and businesses, while S$8.3 billion went to direct household and social support. 
The total expenditure was lower than the initial sum of S$100 billion that the Government committed, said Ms Indranee in response to a question from Member of Parliament Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast).
There were two reasons for the lower spending.
First, the Government had set aside loan capital in FY2020 in anticipation of a tight credit market. But this was not needed eventually, as the Monetary Authority of Singapore rolled out a Singapore-dollar facility to provide low-interest capital to participating financial institutions, she explained.
Second, resources set aside for public health capacity to cater for “potential downside scenarios” were also not fully utilised, as safe management measures and the cooperation of Singaporeans had helped to avert severe public health outcomes.
However, this under-utilisation in funds were offset by the various support packages that were introduced over the heightened alerts and stabilisation phases from May to November 2021 as infection cases spiked, added the minister.
Ms Indranee also noted that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has started a review of the controls and checks in relation to COVID-19-related procurement and expenditure since earlier this year.
“Respective agencies are conducting their audits on COVID-19 pandemic-related procurement and expenditure to ensure transactions are bona fide, and that there is no erroneous payment,” she said.

This comes on top of the yearly audit done by the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO). The latest report by the AGO had highlighted instances of inadequate controls and checks by the Ministry of Manpower, Health Promotion Board and Singapore Land Authority in relation to pandemic-related procurement and expenditure. 
“Drawing lessons from our COVID-19 experience and from the Auditor-General's report, MOF is reviewing our guidelines on procurement, contract management and payment to ensure our control measures are appropriate for future emergencies,” Ms Indranee told the House.
MOF will also be issuing an advisory to agencies on adopting good practices and minimising financial risks during emergencies, she said.
These include adopting system checks on grant eligibility, including data verification at source to reduce the risk of errors from manual processing, and ensuring proper documentation of key decisions, among others."
Creating new COE category for private-hire cars will drive up costs for consumers: Transport Ministry,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coe-phc-private-hire-cars-rental-bid-category-2934951,"SINGAPORE: Removing private-hire cars (PHC) from the usual Certificate of Entitlement (COE) bidding pool will ultimately drive up costs for consumers, Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor told Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
""Removing PHCs from the bidding pool and creating a new category with specific requirements, such as a minimum number of trips to prevent abuse would be difficult to enforce and adds to the compliance cost for PHC operators, drivers and ultimately consumers,"" she said.
She also said that the PHC companies have not submitted COE bids with reserve prices higher than non-PHC companies.

COE price for larger cars in Category B hits second consecutive record high in latest bidding exercise



















Private-hire companies deny bidding aggressively for COEs and pushing premiums up













Dr Khor was responding to a question by MP Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who asked whether car rental companies, particularly those leasing to PHC companies, have affected COE bid prices in the past year.
The COE premium for larger cars in Category B hit a second consecutive record in the latest bidding exercise on Sep 7, as prices closed higher for most categories.
COE premiums have been on a largely upward trend and broken record highs in the past few months, with observers attributing this to a lack of COE supply.
Some netizens have blamed the eye-watering prices on PHC and rental companies, arguing that they should be removed from the COE bidding process, similar to taxi operators. PHC and rental companies earlier told CNA they did not bid aggressively for COEs and were not responsible for the rise in premiums.
Dr Khor said on Tuesday that ""there is no evidence"" PHC companies caused the increase in COE bid prices.
""LTA (Land Transport Authority) has been monitoring the market closely and over the past year. The demand for COEs from PHC companies as well as the overall PHC population have been stable,"" she said.
Since 2012, taxi operators do not have to bid for a COE to register their taxis. Instead, they draw from the pool of Category E (Open) COEs and pay the Category A COE prevailing quota premium.
Taxi availability standards were also introduced, and taxi operators can grow their fleets by up to 2 per cent per annum, subject to meeting the standards, Dr Khor said.
""Unlike taxis, PHCs are essentially privately owned cars that have the flexibility and autonomy to take passengers, thereby augmenting our supply of shared point-to-point vehicles,"" she added.
""Hence, PHCs are treated like privately owned cars under the vehicle quota system.""
Dr Khor said the call to review COE categories is a ""perennial suggestion"", highlighting that there will be trade-offs between having specific categories to meet specific requirements and ensuring sufficient COE quota for those categories.
""The fact is that it is going to lead to further fragmentation and volatility, particularly when COE supply is low,"" she said.
""So, if you're looking at COE premiums and so on, basically it's fundamentally demand and supply for vehicles that determines COE premiums.""
Dr Khor added that LTA will continue to monitor the point-to-point sector and study schemes for further enhancement."
Jail for man who defied COVID-19 order and left home to have supper with friend,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/verner-chua-man-flouted-medical-certificate-frog-leg-porridge-visit-grandma-cut-tag-abscond-court-2934866,"SINGAPORE: A man visited his grandmother despite being ordered to stay home while recovering from symptoms resembling COVID-19.
While he was being investigated for this, he flouted another order by heading out to have dessert and frog porridge with a friend.
With his case still before the courts and while he was under a reformative training scheme, Verner Chua Jun Jie cut his electronic monitoring tag and absconded. 
Chua, now 22, was sentenced to jail for a month and a week on Tuesday (Sep 13).
He pleaded guilty to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of infection and mischief by cutting the electronic monitoring system tag. Two other charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Chua was sentenced to reformative training for prior offences in April 2019. 
In August 2020, he was diagnosed with an acute respiratory infection and ordered to stay home for five days. On the last day of his stay-home period, Chua left his home and took a private-hire vehicle to visit his grandmother.
He then went to a coffee shop to buy lunch before going home, taking a total of three private-hire vehicle trips that day.
Chua was investigated for this offence and initially offered a notice of composition or an out-of-court fine.
HE REPEATED THE SAME OFFENCE
However, he repeated the offence in December 2020. On Dec 6, 2020, he visited a clinic in Bukit Gombak for a cough and sore throat. He was diagnosed with an acute upper respiratory infection and given a COVID-19 swab test.
He was told that he had to stay home for three days or until he received a negative swab test result. Despite acknowledging this, Chua did not head home that day.
He took a taxi to Jalan Sultan later that evening, where he met a friend to borrow money, intending to use the cash to pay the composition fine for the August 2020 offence.
After this, he boarded another taxi with his friend and went for dessert along Balestier Road. They stayed in that area until about 2.40am, before taking another taxi to Geylang for porridge.
Chua went home only at about 4am. He received a negative swab test result only on Dec 8, 2020.
In August 2021, Chua was placed on a release on supervision scheme for his reformative training. Under the scheme, he was required to wear an electronic monitoring tag.
On Sep 27, 2021, Chua was to report to Selarang Halfway House but decided not to do so and proceeded to cut his electronic monitoring tag.
A warrant of arrest was issued for him and he was subsequently remanded.
BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE LAW: PROSECUTOR
The prosecutor asked for one month and one weeks' jail for Chua, noting that he had been out in public and in breach of medical orders for more than eight hours on the second occasion.
He went to multiple locations, most of them food establishments, which are ""more dangerous"" as people would have been eating and talking with their masks removed.
Crucially, said the prosecutor, Chua was already under investigation for a separate case when he committed this second offence. His reason was also ""rather frivolous"", said the prosecutor, as he wanted to go out and eat with a friend.
Chua's pattern of offending ""demonstrates a blatant disregard for the law"", added the prosecutor.
For exposing others to the risk of infection, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.
For mischief, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both."
No plans to include COVID-19 vaccinations in National Childhood Immunisation Schedule: Ong Ye Kung,"COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged six months to five years old will be rolled out end-October or early November.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-children-national-childhool-immunisation-schedule-ong-ye-kung-2934871,"SINGAPORE: The Government has no plans to include COVID-19 vaccinations in the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, which lists the recommended types of vaccines from birth until 17 years old, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Sep 13).
The immunisation schedule covers vaccinations against several diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and diphtheria, which are of “significant healthcare burden” to Singapore if the population was not vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry. 
Of the 12 listed in the schedule, vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are compulsory for children under the Infectious Diseases Act.
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Ong said there are no plans to include COVID-19 vaccinations in the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule as the pandemic situation is dynamic, and recommendations continue to evolve with new data.
""The Ministry of Health will review this when appropriate,"" he added.
Mr Ong was responding to a question from Member of Parliament (MP) Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) who also asked for figures to compare the incidence of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in vaccinated and non-vaccinated children.
The symptoms of MIS-C are similar to Kawasaki disease, which has been linked to various virus or bacterial infections and occurs in 150 to 200 children a year in Singapore.
Symptoms include persistent fever above 38.5 degrees Celsius for three days or more, difficulty breathing, headache, neck swelling, rash, swollen hands and feet, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea or abdominal pain.
As of Aug 29, the incidence of MIS-C was 5.7 per 100,000 for those fully vaccinated amongst COVID-19 patients under the age of 18, according to Mr Ong.
In comparison, the incidence of MIS-C in those who are not fully vaccinated was 38 per 100,000.

When asked when the Health Ministry will be ready to begin COVID-19 vaccinations for children below the age of five, Mr Ong said Singapore has the vaccine supplies, adding that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has approved the two-dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for those aged six months to five years old.
However, as cases are “relatively low” and children in primary school are currently preparing for their examinations, Mr Ong said the rollout of vaccines for younger children as well as booster shots for those aged five and above would be timed around end-October or early November when examinations are over.
“With peace of mind, parents can bring their children both from six months up to 11 years old either for their primary series or for their booster,” he said.
Mr Ong also said the ministry is bringing Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's new bivalent vaccines into Singapore, under agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.
The bivalent vaccines target both the ancestral strain of COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, which includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.
“Our intention is to update our vaccines for the National Vaccination Programme as the formulations improve,” said Mr Ong, adding that more details will be shared when the arrangements are confirmed.
However, he urged the public not to delay their COVID-19 shots in order to wait for new vaccines.
“Existing vaccines remain highly protective against severe disease, including for the Omicron BA.5 infections,” he said.
“So if you are eligible to receive another vaccine dose, please receive your vaccination without delay, and not wait for variant-specific vaccines, as COVID-19 is still spreading in the community.”
VACCINATION DIFFERENTIATED MEASURES
Responding to a question from MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) about whether healthcare resources remain a binding constraint on vaccination differentiated measures, Mr Ong said that while such measures are compulsory for specific settings such as events with more than 500 participants at any one time, business owners and employers also have the flexibility to implement conditions of service that are relevant to their settings.
This includes requiring people to wear masks as well as adopting vaccination-related instructions for customers or workers.
However, he added that the Government is reviewing vaccination requirements as well as vaccination differentiated measures as Singapore lives with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.
This means moving away from counting the number of doses and boosters, and instead ensuring that vaccination is ""up to date"", he said, adding that the review is expected to be completed in the next few months.

Employers and workers should adopt 'flexible mindset' on 4-day work week although it may not work for all: Gan Siow Huang,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/4-day-work-week-flexible-work-arrangements-employers-mindset-2934531,"SINGAPORE: Employers and workers should adopt a ""flexible mindset"" on a four-day work week, Minister of State in the Manpower Ministry Gan Siow Huang said in Parliament on Tuesday (Sep 13).
She added that a four-day work week may work well for some employers and employees but not others.
""A four-day work week is one of many types of flexible work arrangements, and the ministry, together with our tripartite partners, strongly encourages employers and employees to be open to flexible work arrangements in all its various forms to identify and adopt those that best suit their unique business needs and their workers' needs,"" Ms Gan said.
She was responding to a question from MP Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) on whether studies were being conducted by third parties to examine the feasibility of a four-day work week in Singapore.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is not aware of any ongoing studies by third parties, said Ms Gan, who added that reports of four-day work week pilots implemented in other countries appeared mixed.
These included pilot programmes in Ireland, Japan and Spain. In Belgium, employees have the right to request a four-day work week, but with daily work hours extended so that the total number of hours worked in a week remains the same, she said.
""So far, results appear to be mixed. Some of the key concerns that stakeholders have include the impact on productivity, business costs, and employee well-being,"" said Ms Gan.
She added that while productivity improvements have been reported in some cases, this depends on the sector and job type.
""In some instances, reduced work hours have had to be compensated by hiring more labour,"" said Ms Gan.
""At the same time, employees are concerned that their salaries could be reduced due to fewer hours worked, while some could face increased stress when they work more hours than usual in a day to complete their work.""
Mr Yong also asked if MOM intended to trial the four-day work week on a small scale among its officers or other parts of the public service.
He said this could facilitate training and upskilling as well as improve work-life balance for employees.
Ms Gan said that MOM did not intend to specify any trial or impose formulas for flexible work arrangements on the public sector, and noted the diverse needs of different sectors and job roles.

"Man illegally recorded, sold videos of sex acts with women he met on Tinder","The 23-year-old was sentenced to 24 weeks’ jail after he pleaded guilty to five charges including insulting a woman's modesty, selling obscene videos and criminal intimidation.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-illegally-record-tinder-sell-videos-sex-acts-jail-court-2934666,"SINGAPORE: A man engaged in sexual activities with at least 20 women he met on dating application Tinder, recording and photographing some of them without their consent.
He illegally sold some of the images and videos of the sex acts, resulting in the footage being circulated online.
Chan Xin Kai, 23, was sentenced to 24 weeks' jail on Monday (Sep 12) for his crimes. He pleaded guilty to five charges including insulting a woman's modesty, selling obscene videos and criminal intimidation. Another six charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Chan was between 18 and 20 at the time of the crimes. He joined Tinder in 2016 or 2017 and befriended various women on the application.
He engaged in sexual activities with at least 20 of them and also did the same with other women he met in school, the prosecutor said.
Chan often recorded or photographed the sex acts, sometimes without the consent of the women.
One of the victims got to know Chan on Tinder in early 2018, when she was 18 and he was 19. They ""engaged in a sexual relationship"", court documents said, before breaking off contact in late 2018.
However, in February 2019, the victim received a screenshot from an unknown person on Instagram asking if she was the person depicted in the screenshot. The photo showed the victim performing a sex act.
The victim lodged a police report over the incident, and found out from a friend that nude videos and pictures of her were circulating online.
The victim confronted Chan, but he denied circulating the images. He claimed that he had deleted them and lost his phone.
Investigations revealed otherwise: Chan had taken a total of 56 videos and 112 photos of the victim while they were engaging in sex acts.
He decided to earn some cash by selling these videos and photos in November 2018, and picked her as he felt he was not as close to her as his other partners.
Chan created fake profiles on dating and chat apps posing as the victim and offered to sell her photos and videos. He managed to sell two obscene videos of the victim to two unknown individuals, earning S$160.
He also earned another S$240 selling videos and photos of other victims performing private acts.
Another victim was 20 when she met Chan on Tinder. She engaged in sex acts with him regularly for five months.
Chan took 36 photos and 20 videos of this victim performing intimate acts without her consent.
On May 15, 2019, Chan threatened this victim by sending her a message on Telegram. He said: ""Yea I have your nudes btw so u may want to reply me.""
At the time of this message, the victim had stopped meeting Chan and no longer wanted to do so. However, Chan wanted to meet her for sex and threatened to circulate her nude photos in order to get her to meet him.
Feeling threatened and afraid that Chan would circulate the photos of her, the victim met Chan. He assured her that he had deleted the images but did not actually do so.
""SERIOUS OFFENCE""
The prosecutor asked for 24 to 31 weeks' jail and objected to the calling of a probation suitability report. 
She noted the harm and seriousness of Chan's offences, saying that he had intruded upon the privacy of multiple victims and sold obscene videos of this intrusion to others.
""Filming victims in their private moments is a serious offence which warranted the updating of the Penal Code in 2019,"" noted the prosecutor.
A Penal Code Review Committee observed that there was a need to provide for the specific offence of voyeurism to address the serious problems that technology had created, remarking further that there was a ""bustling market"" online for upskirt videos and photos, said the prosecutor.
She added that many of the videos in this case involved a high degree of intrusion where the victim was identifiable. Additionally, Chan was between 18 and 20 years old at the time of the offences and was not particularly young.
The prosecutor pointed out Chan's long period of offending and the difficulty of detection - if the first victim had not been informed that her videos were being circulated, the accused might not have been caught for his actions of recording multiple victims."
Foreigners account for 'very small proportion' of private housing transactions in Singapore: Desmond Lee,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/private-housing-transactions-foreigners-share-desmond-lee-mnd-2934616,"SINGAPORE: Foreigners account for ""a very small proportion"" of private housing transactions, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said on Monday (Sep 12).
""In the past two years, they (foreigners) accounted for around 3 per cent of all private housing transactions,"" Mr Lee wrote in an answer to a parliamentary question by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Leong Mun Wai (PSP).
""This is lower than the pre-pandemic level of around 5 per cent between 2017 and 2019.""
Mr Leong asked Mr Lee if the inflow of foreign money into the local property market has increased in the last two years and, if so, whether such an inflow had pushed up private and public property prices.
He also asked if the Government intend to introduce new policies to manage the impact of the ""flow of foreign money into the local property market"".
In his answer, Mr Lee pointed out that foreigners are not allowed to buy Housing Board flats. 
""While the foreigner share of private housing transactions remains low, the Government will continue monitoring foreign money inflows on our property market closely and adjust our policies as necessary, to promote a stable and sustainable property market,"" he said.
Private home prices rose by 3.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, according to statistics released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in July.
This followed a 0.7 per cent increase in the first quarter of this year after the introduction of cooling measures in December 2021. Prices rose by 2.2 per cent in 2020 and 10.6 per cent in 2021.
According to an analysis in July from OrangeTee & Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics Christine Sun, purchases by foreign buyers rose in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the preceding quarter.
Based on URA Realis data, the number of non-landed homes excluding executive condominiums bought by foreigners or non-permanent residents rose by 102.8 per cent from 144 units in the first quarter of this year to 292 units in the second quarter, Ms Sun said.
The proportion of foreign purchases climbed from 3.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent over that same period, she added. 
She said Singapore has emerged as a ""top investment destination"" given the geopolitical and economic uncertainties in other Asian countries.

MULTIPLE UNIT PURCHASES
In a separate reply on Monday. Mr Lee also addressed the subject of property buyers who purchase multiple units in the same development.
MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked if the Ministry of National Development would consider introducing a higher tier of additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) for such buyers and if such purchases would negate or cushion the impact of previous ABSD increases.
He also asked about the circumstances under which the ministry would consider introducing curbs on bulk property purchases.
""Instances of property buyers who have purchased more than one unit in a single development are uncommon,"" Mr Lee said in his written reply.
""Among all private residential property units transacted so far this year, units involved in such multiple-unit purchases accounted for about 1 per cent. Units involved in multiple-unit purchases of more than two units are even lower, at about 0.2 per cent.
""Hence, bulk property purchases are unlikely to have a significant impact on the property market.""
Mr Lee said that developments in the property market would be monitored closely, with policies adjusted as necessary to promote a stable and sustainable market.
He also highlighted that ABSD is structured to moderate investment demand in residential property and is differentiated based on the residency status of the buyer and the overall number of residential properties they own.
""ABSD discourages the purchase of multiple units, as higher rates generally apply to purchases by those who already own at least one residential property,"" he said, adding that higher rates also apply to buyers who are not Singaporeans.
In December last year, ABSD rates were raised across all buyer profiles except for Singaporeans and permanent residents buying their first residential property."
"StanChart robbery copycat who targeted moneylender while carrying auxiliary police gun gets jail, caning","The former AETOS auxiliary police officer copied the Standard Chartered robbery, where offender James Roach showed the bank teller a note demanding money. However, in this case, he actually had a loaded gun.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/aetos-auxiliary-officer-robbery-jurong-gun-ot-credit-jail-caning-court-2934541,"SINGAPORE: Facing mounting debts from loan sharks, a former AETOS auxiliary officer decided to replicate the Standard Chartered robbery and took his revolver with him to rob a licensed moneylender of about S$24,800.
Mahadi Muhamad Mukhtar, 39, was sentenced to 16 years and six months' jail as well as 18 strokes of the cane on Tuesday (Sep 13). He pleaded guilty to three charges of robbery, unlawfully carrying a revolver and unlawful possession of ammunition. Another two charges were taken into consideration.
The court heard that Mahadi was employed at AETOS holdings as an auxiliary police officer. He began borrowing money from unlicensed moneylenders in February 2021 to pay off his bank loan.
His debts accumulated with six unlicensed moneylenders, and he began borrowing from his friends and taking bank loans. Eventually, he decided to commit robbery to solve his financial problems, the court heard.
He began researching robberies on the Internet. At first, he thought of robbing a jewellery shop, but thought it would be difficult to sell the jewellery. 
He decided to rob a licensed moneylender and settled on OT Credit, as it was staffed by women, was not usually crowded and had previously been robbed.
On Apr 12 last year, he went to OT Credit at Block 135, Jurong Gateway Road to ensure it was open for business. He saw that it was, and that two female employees were on duty.
After this, he went to AETOS complex to cover a colleague's shift. Later that afternoon, he loaded five rounds of ammunition into his M85 Taurus revolver and placed it in his sling bag.
He changed out of his AETOS shirt into a dark blue polo to avoid being identified before taking a Grab ride to JCube shopping centre with the loaded revolver in his bag.
Mahadi went to OT Credit and saw only one female employee and one customer in the store. He thought about how he would demand the money and decided to copy the approach in the Standard Chartered robbery by writing his demands on a note.
In the 2016 Standard Chartered robbery, Canadian James Roach handed a note to a bank teller and placed his hand in a sling bag on the counter, pretending it was a gun.
The note by Roach said: ""This is a robbery. I have a gun in my bag."" The bank teller handed Roach about S$30,000 and he fled the country with it. He was taken back to Singapore and sentenced to five years' jail and six strokes of the cane last year.

""DON'T SHOUT""
Mahadi went to a toilet and transferred the revolver from his bag to his front pocket. He wrote on a piece of paper: ""This is a robbery. Don't shout. I got gun in my pocket. Put all the money in the bag.""
He then went to OT Credit and handed the message to a female credit loan officer who was on duty.
Fearing for her life, she hit the panic button under the table before complying with Mahadi's instruction to put money inside his sling bag.
Mahadi left the store with about S$24,800 in his sling bag and booked a GrabCar. He boarded the vehicle at the Science Centre and changed his destination from AETOS complex to Boon Lay Shopping Centre.
He deposited S$10,000 at an OCBC ATM, and another S$14,000 into a POSB bank account. He made four online banking transactions transferring about S$11,150 to loan sharks, and threw away the robbery note after tearing it up.

At 4.50pm, he boarded an AETOS van and went to work. He was arrested by the police a few hours later at AETOS Complex.
The bulk of the robbery proceeds were recovered, but no restitution was made of the remainder, which amounts to about S$5,000.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh asked for 15 to 20 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. He emphasised the severity of the case, saying: ""This is a case where an auxiliary police officer makes off with his loaded service revolver and brings it with him to commit a serious crime, a robbery.""
He said there was a pressing public interest to guard against such crimes, noting the abuse of trust by Mahadi, who had been entrusted with a firearm for his duties.

There was also a high level of premeditation and planning as seen from his Internet searches and considering of various options to commit the robbery as well as surveillance of his chosen target, said Mr Koh.
Comparing the case with James Roach's Standard Chartered robbery, Mr Koh said that Roach was bluffing, as he had no weapon on him, but Mahadi was not bluffing.
""Correspondingly, there will be a real risk of serious harm while there was none in James Roach,"" said Mr Koh.
""We note that concern that the accused had copied the James Roach robbery, and this signals that the sentence in the James Roach robbery is not severe enough to send a message that such behaviour is not acceptable,"" said Mr Koh, adding that a stronger message needs to be sent.
Defence lawyer Mark Yeo of Kalco Law asked instead for 10 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane, the mandatory minimum. He said his client had no prior convictions and had cooperated with the police and confessed everything. Even though he had disposed of the note, it was still recovered in full.
Comparing the case to Roach's, Mr Yeo said Roach's case involved a higher value of cash. Not only did he write that he had a gun in his bag, Roach ""deliberately presented himself in a way that led the victim to believe that he did have a weapon"", said Mr Yeo.
He said the sentence the prosecution was asking for was manifestly excessive, adding that his client may have committed serious offences but ""is not beyond redemption"".
""His conduct prior to and after the arrest shows he has a strong chance of rehabilitation,"" said the lawyer.
Justice Vincent Hoong said he found that the harm disclosed in this case was substantial, given that the accused had armed himself with a loaded revolver capable of inflicting serious harm on others.
He said he noted Mahadi's plea of guilt, his cooperation with authorities and lack of past convictions, but placed no weight on the fact that Mahadi was moved by his financial difficulties to commit the crimes."
Public warning system to be sounded islandwide on Sep 15,"The signal will also sound for all smartphones that have the SGSecure Mobile App downloaded and are not on silent or vibration mode.

SAF Amnesty Scheme for drug offences only available to SAF soldiers once: Ng Eng Hen,"Under the SAF Amnesty Scheme, soldiers who have taken illegal drugs can choose to confess without being punished. They will receive counselling and undergo regular tests.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/saf-amnesty-scheme-drug-offences-only-once-soldiers-2934421,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Amnesty Scheme, which is for soldiers who have confessed to taking illegal drugs, is only available to soldiers once, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Monday (Sep 12).
Normal penalties will apply for subsequent drug offences, he added.
Under the SAF Amnesty Scheme, those who have consumed illegal drugs can choose to confess without being punished. Soldiers will receive counselling and rehabilitation support to help them kick their habit. 
They will also undergo regular tests, Dr Ng wrote in an answer to a parliamentary question by MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) on the steps taken for detecting and preventing abuse of controlled substances in military installations.
The SAF Amnesty Scheme was introduced in 1976 to provide an opportunity for drug abusers to seek help.
Singapore swimmer Joseph Schooling confessed to consuming cannabis overseas in May when he was on short-term disruption from full-time National Service (NS) to train and participate in the SEA Games.
Urine tests for controlled drugs conducted on Schooling returned negative.

Known or suspected drug abusers who have confessed or had recent drug convictions will be put on a urine test regime and drug counselling sessions. During the test regime, they will be screened up to three times a week for up to six months. 
""If they test positive, they will be investigated for drug offences and potentially charged in court martial. This serves as both a deterrence and a form of rehabilitation to help them stay away from drugs,"" Dr Ng said.
Urine tests are conducted across the SAF to monitor for drug abuse. All enlistees undergo urine tests during their Basic Military Training (BMT).
Such tests are also conducted without notice in units, overseas bases and training locations, as well as on returning service personnel, the Defence Minister said.
The SAF Military Police conducts routine spot checks to ensure that illegal products, including controlled drugs, are not brought into SAF premises. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) informs the SAF Military Police Command when SAF personnel are arrested for drug offences.
""Enforcement against SAF soldiers who are drug abusers is strict for deterrence,"" said Dr Ng.
SAF servicemen or women who test positive during urine screening will be charged. They are typically sentenced by the military courts to a minimum of eight to nine months detention in the SAF Detention Barracks, he added.
All recruits attend talks conducted by the SAF Counselling Centre (SCC) during their BMT on the harmful effects of drugs.
After BMT, anti-drug talks are conducted periodically by the SCC and CNB at SAF camps and units. Before overseas exercises or postings, SAF personnel are briefed on and reminded of the consequences of taking drugs overseas, said Dr Ng."
CNA Explains: The police will soon collect DNA from more offenders. Can you refuse to comply?,"Under the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in Parliament on Monday, the police will be able to collect DNA from more suspects and offenders. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-dna-crime-privacy-registration-criminals-act-2926981,"SINGAPORE: The Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament on Monday (Sep 12) to allow the Singapore Police Force to collect DNA from more suspects and offenders.
The move will improve the police’s investigative capabilities, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had said.
Under current law, the police can collect DNA from people arrested for what is called “registrable” crimes and store it in a database for reference.
Registrable crimes comprise more serious offences that will lead to a criminal record, such as murder, rape and robbery.
“Restricting the collection of an individual’s particulars and DNA information to just these types of crime has resulted in smaller databases, which may limit the police’s ability to solve crimes, especially in cases with very few leads,” MHA said during the Bill’s introduction.

Police may be allowed to collect DNA from more suspects and offenders under new Bill



















Gardens by the Bay murder: How police used DNA to prove their case













The Bill will allow police to collect DNA for “eligible” crimes, comprising offences that are imprisonable and not compoundable such as by paying a fine, and thus are considered more serious. These offences include voluntarily causing hurt and affray.
The police will still not be allowed to collect DNA for minor compoundable offences, including littering and minor parking infringements.






















Why do the police need more DNA?
MHA said DNA information is a useful tool for crime-solving, and that a larger DNA database would be more effective for comparing samples from crime scenes.
The police earlier told CNA that DNA has helped it solve major crimes quicker. A larger DNA database would also deter more would-be criminals, said Superintendent of Police Roy Lim, head of the Special Investigation Section.
Without closed-circuit television camera footage or eyewitness accounts, DNA becomes even more crucial in proving or disproving an accused person’s version of events.
What if I choose not to give my DNA?
The Bill will make it clear that it is an offence for someone arrested for a registrable crime to refuse to give his blood sample for DNA without good cause. The courts could take a negative inference on him during proceedings.
Current law already states that it is an offence for the person to decline to have his photos and fingerprints taken without reasonable excuse.
The penalties for both offences are the same: Those convicted could be jailed up to a month, fined a maximum of S$1,000, or both.
Where will my DNA go?
DNA collected by the police is stored in a database. Launched in 2004, the database is owned by the police and run by the Health Sciences Authority, which helps law enforcement agencies analyse evidence for DNA.
The police can use the DNA database to determine whether DNA recovered from a crime scene matches someone in the system.
The database also stores DNA evidence from previous crime scenes, allowing the police to solve cold cases when a matching profile enters the system down the road.
The Bill will also allow the police to share DNA of those convicted of a registrable crime with foreign law enforcement agencies, if they assess this to be necessary for investigations or proceedings.
“The amendments will also strengthen international cooperation in the prevention and investigation of crimes,” MHA said.
What about security and privacy concerns?
MHA said it will introduce legislative safeguards to protect the information recorded in the various databases against any loss, modification and unauthorised access. There will also be a tamper-proof audit trail to detect any data modification. 
“These measures will safeguard and prevent the misuse of such sensitive data. Officers who misuse their powers will be dealt with severely,” the ministry said.
Foreign law enforcement agencies that get DNA from Singapore police will be required to provide an undertaking to safe keep the data, limit its uses and destroy the information upon conclusion of its use.
How long will my DNA stay in the database?
If investigations find that you were ultimately not involved in committing a registrable or eligible crime, your information will automatically be removed.
If you were charged and convicted of the crime, your information will only be removed after you die or hit the ripe age of 100.
It gets a bit tricky if you were acquitted, compounded or granted a discharge amounting to acquittal of the offence. Under current law, your data will automatically be removed. However, the Bill now requires a person under these circumstances to apply to have their data removed.
Police will comply with this request unless it decides that the data is relevant to other ongoing prosecutions or investigations, or if retention of the data is necessary to safeguard Singapore’s national security.
An individual whose application is rejected can appeal to a reviewing tribunal, comprising a district judge or magistrate, within 30 days of the police’s decision. The tribunal’s decision is final.
But there is a caveat: If a person is acquitted of offences under the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act or the Internal Security Act, the Minister for Home Affairs could issue a certificate if he deems that retaining the data is in the interest of national security.
The reviewing tribunal must then dismiss the appeal if the police present this certificate.
Can I give my DNA even if I am not involved in police investigations?
Under current law, only people who were present at the crime scene or questioned in investigations can voluntarily provide their DNA.
The Bill will now allow any individual to provide their DNA voluntarily to the police. Volunteers can also request the police to delete their information at any time, and the police must comply with their request.
Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story said it is currently not an offence for someone arrested for a registrable crime to refuse to give DNA. This is inaccurate. We apologise for the error."
1% of national servicemen ineligible for NS55 credits due to 'serious offences and disciplinary issues',,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-servicemen-ns55-recognition-package-credits-redemption-ineligible-offences-disciplinary-2933656,"SINGAPORE: About 1 per cent of national servicemen were ineligible for the NS55 Recognition Package due to serious offences and disciplinary issues.
This was revealed by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in a written reply to Parliament on Monday (Sep 12), following a question by MP Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (PAP-Jalan Besar) on how many national servicemen were not eligible to receive the package.
The NS55 Recognition Package was given to eligible past and present national servicemen to thank them for their contributions to Singapore's defence and security, as the country marks 55 years of National Service. 
The package included S$100 worth of credits disbursed via the LifeSG mobile application, as well as a complimentary one-year SAFRA or HomeTeamNS membership.
“All eligible recipients have received their credits by end-July and as of end August, more than 50 per cent of recipients have used some or all of their credits,” Dr Ng said.
“About 47 per cent of all credits issued have already been spent, which is much higher than the figure over the same period for the NS50 package in 2017, when hardcopy vouchers were distributed.”

Dr Wan Rizal also asked about the number of complaints on difficulties encountered in claiming the credits, and the measures taken to address the respective issues.
Dr Ng said that the LifeSG application, which is used to redeem the credits, had an average rating of 4.8 out of five stars.
He added that the call centres and email hotlines of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs have responded to about 8,000 calls and emails from national servicemen who needed help to redeem their credits or requested for hardcopy vouchers.
The number made up about 0.8 per cent of all recipients. 
Digital ambassadors were also deployed at locations such as selected community centres and public libraries, as well SAFRA and HomeTeamNS clubhouses. They catered to about 16,000 walk-ins from members of the public, helping them with a variety of issues such as app installation and navigating the redemption service.
About 4,000 national servicemen, or about 0.4 per cent, have requested to have hardcopy vouchers sent to them instead of using the app.
“These are primarily servicemen who do not have access to smartphones or are not comfortable with making digital payments, notwithstanding our offer of assistance,” said Dr Ng. 
He added that those who opt to convert their digital credits to hardcopy vouchers will generally receive them within one month of their request."
"MPs call for more support for teachers, special bonus to recognise hard work during COVID-19 pandemic","The Members of Parliament also urged the Ministry of Education to review the non-teaching-related workload of teachers. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parliament-more-support-teachers-special-bonus-2933381,"SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament called for more to be done to support teachers, including a special bonus to recognise their hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Speaking in Parliament on Monday (Sep 12) during an adjournment motion, Nominated MP Abdul Samad Abdul Wahab said he decided to raise the motion after seeing a video of a student in St Andrew’s Secondary School threatening a teacher with violence. 
Unions that represent teachers across Singapore said they receive more than 1,000 cases of grievances each year, ranging from managing students’ behaviour, abuse from parents, and issues relating to mental health or career progression, said Mr Samad. 
“The unions acknowledged that Ministry of Education (MOE) had been supportive towards them in resolving conflicts and take feedback positively on salary scale and career progression,” he added, citing the recent pay bumps announced for MOE officers. 





Related:

MOE teachers, allied educators to get salary increase of up to 10% from Oct 1













However, the unions believe that the Education Ministry could do more to implement policies to address teachers’ concerns, including ones that would “set a baseline” for school practices, said Mr Abdul Samad, who is the vice-president of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). 
Assistant secretary-general of NTUC Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer SMC) said while he welcomed the pay bumps for MOE officers, he hoped the salary increases and improved retention benefits could also be extended to all other educators, including those in polytechnics and Institutes for Technical Education (ITEs). 
“I am happy to share that some unionised companies in the private education sector have also done a review and given salary adjustments,” he added. 
“We hope that the rest of the players in the private education sphere, which includes early childhood, student care, autonomous universities, and PEIs (private education institutes), will also do likewise and review their salaries to ensure that their overall salary packages remain competitive, and also to help those who need to cope with the rising cost of living."" 
Some trainers and lecturers in private education institutes are independent contractors, or gig workers, and a review of their compensation and benefits is also timely, said Mr Tay. 
“All these will go a long way to give an assurance to our educators that whether they're from the public and private sectors, their role in educating our future generations is recognised and valued,” he added. 
The salaries of student care educators are “disproportionately low” compared to the deliverables and expectations from parents, said Mr Tay. 
“There are minimal progression opportunities for this group of educators. I hope that we can do more to uplift the profession of this group of educators and help raise the salary and progression of these student care educators,” he added. 
Mr Abdul Samad called upon MOE to consider giving teachers a special bonus to recognise their effort in “managing extraordinary workload and stress during the pandemic”. 
“This gesture is also similar (to the one) given by Ministry of Health for all their healthcare personnel in managing the pandemic,” he added.

Special education teachers hope to see salaries reviewed after pay bump for MOE teachers













Both Mr Tay and Mr Abdul Samad urged MOE to reduce teachers’ workloads, especially when it comes to responsibilities not related to teaching.
Calling on parents to support teachers, Mr Abdul Samad stressed that teachers also have their own personal lives and families. 
“We as parents need to understand that teachers need their work-life balance as much as us. Even with this, the teachers will always go beyond the call of duty,” he added. 
“However, parents must always respect teachers' private space and time. Parents can play a role in becoming constructive and complementary partners of teachers to support the students’ growth and development.” 
Teachers need more time outside of the classroom to mark homework, prepare for lessons and guide students, said Mr Abdul Samad. 
“To then load them with committee work, non-teaching-related duties and meetings as well as constant, non-stop WhatsApp messages from multiple chat groups is unwise and untenable,” he added. 
Mr Tay suggested educators be given opportunities to go on sabbaticals or gap years to go on industry attachments outside of the education service to “recharge and refresh their knowledge and perspectives"". 
He also noted that teachers spend a lot of time setting and preparing for exams. 
“Can I suggest that all exam papers be set at a group or cluster level for all our mainstream levels... so that time can be saved and there is greater uniformity, consistency, and alignment, especially such as during the pandemic, where prelim results are used as a proxy when the student is unable to undertake national exams,” said Mr Tay. 
“This will reduce disparity and take a whole load of onerous time off teachers and schools with this co-sharing of exam script preparation.” 
MANAGING TEACHERS' WORKLOAD
Responding to Mr Tay and Mr Abdul Samad, Minister of State for Education Gan Siow Huang (PAP-Marymount SMC) noted that managing teachers' workload is ""an important area of focus"" for MOE. 
“We have reduced administrative work by strengthening centralised services and leveraging technology,"" she added. 
MOE will consider other ways to ""create capacity for our educators"", including Mr Tay's suggestion to set common exam papers across schools, said Ms Gan. 
She added that during school holidays, all schools have protected vacation time for educators, ensuring that they have time to rest and recharge. 
Schools and education institutions have also introduced more flexible work arrangements for educators “where feasible”. 
“This includes holding virtual or hybrid parent-teacher meetings and staff meetings. Educators who require greater flexibility in working hours can also apply for part-time teaching arrangements,” she added. 
Polytechnics and ITEs are currently conducting a salary review, and the outcome will be shared with staff when it is complete, said Ms Gan. 
She also thanked Mr Abdul Samad for his suggestion on a special bonus for teachers. 
""While paying our educators competitively is important, building a quality teaching service goes beyond salaries,"" she added. 
Parents play a significant role in supporting the well-being of teachers, said the Minister of State. 
She urged parents to work with teachers to establish “positive partnerships and set appropriate expectations” of teachers’ responsibilities. 
“For example, parents could respect educators’ personal time by minimising non-critical communication with them outside work hours.
""Give schools and educators some time to respond to your queries and feedback. Work together with the educators to support your children’s learning and complement the learning with what can be done at home.”

Applicants for new work pass to attract top talent will be carefully vetted: Manpower Minister
Singapore will put in place safeguards to ensure that a new work pass for top talent is not abused, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Monday (Aug 12).
The Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass (ONE Pass) is a new five-year Singapore work pass with a monthly salary threshold of S$30,000 or more.
Dr Tan said that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) already conducts back-end checks to sieve out potential cases of false salary declarations and this will also apply to all ONE Pass applications. After the application is approved, MOM will continue to engage the pass holders during their time in Singapore, he added.
Applicants who do not meet the salary threshold can also apply if they have outstanding achievements in the fields of arts, sports, science or academia. 
When asked how such talent will be assessed, Dr Tan said such applicants will be able to ""help us push new frontiers, draw in greater investments and interest to grow our local ecosystem, and most importantly, create a diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans”.
He said the pass is not meant to be used as a visit or travel document and that “MOM reserves the right to cancel the pass if there are extended periods of economic inactivity with no good reasons”.
Alongside the ONE Pass, there will be other adjustments to Singapore's work pass framework, such as a higher salary benchmark for top EP holders to be exempt from certain requirements. Dr Tan said these changes do not constitute a relaxation of existing policies.
Singapore cannot rely on 'sentiment-driven' collections to meet rising expenditure needs, GST hike to go ahead: Lawrence Wong
Responding to questions on whether the increase in tax revenue that was collected in FY2021/22 could help to defer the planned Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike in 2023 and 2024, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said Singapore cannot rely on collections such as stamp duties as a stable and sustainable source of revenue to meet rising recurrent expenditure needs.
Mr Wong, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, noted that such revenues can fluctuate from year to year.
S$60.7 billion in tax revenue was collected in FY2021/22, a 22.4 per cent jump from the previous year as the economy rebounded following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. The increase was also driven by higher-than-expected collections of ""sentiment-based"" revenue.
Mr Wong said the higher tax revenue was used to support new spending needs, including the enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit scheme, as well as to provide short term relief for businesses and families.
On inflation, Mr Wong said the GST increase will proceed as planned despite rising inflation, but that the Government ""will also ensure that the majority of Singaporean households will not feel the impact of the GST increase for at least five years, while lower-income households will not feel the impact for about 10 years"".

"Bill allowing police to collect DNA from more people passed as MPs sound privacy, security concerns","The amendments will allow police to collect DNA from people arrested for more crimes, which the Government says will improve its ability to solve crimes.
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-dna-crime-privacy-security-2933231,"SINGAPORE: Parliament on Monday (Sep 12) passed a draft law that widens the scope under which police can collect DNA from people under arrest, after Members of Parliament debated the privacy and security concerns surrounding this.
Under the Bill, more crimes will be added to a list for which DNA can be collected from suspects, a move the Government had argued will improve the police’s ability to solve crimes. The current practice of restricting DNA collection to a list of registrable crimes has resulted in a smaller DNA database, said the Government.
Registrable crimes comprise more serious offences like murder, rape, and robbery as well as other offences like shop theft, molestation and cheating.
The Bill will now allow police to collect and store DNA from those arrested for ""eligible"" crimes like voluntarily causing hurt, drink driving and reproducing obscene films. Eligible crimes, considered more serious, are those that are imprisonable and not compoundable under any written law.
The DNA information can be used for criminal investigations, forensic comparison with other DNA information, and for criminal proceedings.
The Bill will also allow the information to be used to identify a dead individual, and for any investigations and inquiries into a death. It can also be used to identify an individual, who is otherwise unidentified or unable to identify himself.
Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling pointed out that about one in three individuals convicted of a registrable crime between 2017 and 2021 had been previously convicted of a non-registrable crime.
“If we had been able to collect DNA and identifying information from these individuals when they were convicted of a non-registrable crime, we might have been able to identify them a lot more swiftly, when they later re-offended and committed the registrable crime,” she said in her opening speech on Monday.

Gardens by the Bay murder: How police used DNA to prove their case













But MPs alluded to how the expanded scope for DNA collection could infringe on people’s privacy, and questioned how the sensitive information would be protected.
Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (WP-Aljunied) asked how the Government intends to ensure the ""secrecy"" of the DNA database, cautioning that DNA information could be used to create more comprehensive profiles of people.
“In this era of big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the purposes for which the DNA information is collected becomes exceedingly important, something Parliament must scrupulously guard,” he said.
“Seen in this context, the Bill envisages the surrender of private information for which the highest levels of security and access must be assured by the Government.”
MP Denise Phua (PAP-Jalan Besar) asked how authorities decided on the additional list of offences eligible for DNA collection, calling the collection and addition of one’s DNA information to a criminal database a “grave matter”.
“Even if giving up one’s personal data is the consequence of committing a crime, the state should not over-infringe the bounds of a citizen’s privacy rights,” she said.











Ms Sun said in her closing speech that the Government has looked at the DNA collection regime in foreign jurisdictions.
For instance, in the Australian state of South Australia, DNA information is collected for all imprisonable offences, while England collects DNA information for all imprisonable offences and some non-imprisonable offences.
“We did not just adopt wholesale the practices of other countries, but where appropriate, adapted it to suit our context,” she said.
“We have chosen to expand our collection only to offences that are punishable by imprisonment and not compoundable under any written law, unless the offence is specified in the fourth schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.
“This strikes the appropriate balance in our local context.”
As for security concerns, Ms Sun reiterated that only authorised individuals are allowed to access the DNA database.
“All access is logged and recorded, and there will be an audit trail to detect any data access. The DNA information is stored on a standalone, secured network to prevent unauthorised access,” she said.
“When there is unauthorised access, action will be taken. This could include criminal charges being brought.”
Ms Sun also pointed to an existing framework to manage government data incidents.
“In the event of a data breach, appropriate remedial actions will be taken in accordance with standard operating procedures and workflows,” she added.
Beyond the police’s DNA database, MP Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) urged the Government to consider establishing a national DNA registry, comprising the DNA sequence of every Singaporean and resident.
“Beyond identifying criminals, a DNA registry can also be helpful in identifying missing victims, or in an event with mass casualties,” he said.
“To the family of a victim in a homicide case, every possible tool to help bring the assailant to justice counts. To deter a potential criminal (and increase) his risk of being caught, counts.”
In response, Ms Sun said the Government would study this suggestion.
REMOVING DNA INFORMATION FROM DATABASE
Some MPs also raised issues with how the Bill requires individuals to apply to remove their DNA information from the database.
Under current law, the police are required to immediately remove an individual’s DNA data from their records if he is subsequently acquitted or discharged by the court, or if his offence is compounded, or if he is found to not be involved in the commission of any crime.
But under the new Bill, this is no longer automatically done and eligible individuals must now apply to have their data removed.
Even so, the police can choose not to do so - when it has reasonable grounds to believe that retaining the DNA is either relevant to other ongoing prosecutions or investigations, or necessary to safeguard national security. 
If the police reject the application, the individual can appeal to a reviewing tribunal within 30 days of the police’s determination. 
“This current Bill changes the default - from automatic deletion to automatic retention. Why is there a shift in policy? Is it necessitated by a change in the law and order situation?” asked MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok).
“Why is it not preferable for the current mechanism of automatic removal to be maintained? The current system is fair to all, the proposed system appears to benefit those with the resources, the time, and the know-how to request for such a deletion.”
To this, Ms Sun replied that the database’s purpose is to assist in solving crime.
“When the acquitted accused applies to have his information removed, we will remove it except under two circumstances,” she said.
“Subject to that, it is in society's interest that there is a larger database of DNA. The DNA has to be collected and retained in acceptable ways.”
MPs Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) and Sharael Taha (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol) also asked for more details on the process of seeking data removal.
Ms Sun noted that an individual will have to apply for removal online with their particulars and case details. The registrar will then review the application and provide an official reply within 30 days. 
Details of the application process will be made available on SPF’s website in due course, she added.
“When the registrar rejects … an individual's application to remove his (DNA) from the database, the registrar will notify the applicant and state the reasons for the rejection,” she said.
“If his data has been retained because there is an ongoing prosecution or investigation, the individual should be aware when these are concluded, such that he may reapply for expungement.”
If the person’s data is retained due to national security concerns, authorities will not be able to inform him when these concerns no longer exist, Ms Sun said.
“If he disagrees with the decision of the registrar, he can appeal to the reviewing tribunal. Even if the reviewing tribunal dismisses the appeal, the individual may be applied for removal at any time,” she said."
"Salary increases for administrative service officers, judicial and statutory appointment holders: PSD","The salary adjustments are between 5 per cent and 12 per cent, which will enable the Public Service to continue to attract and retain talent for key leadership roles, said the Public Service Division.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/salary-increases-administrative-officers-judicial-statutory-appointment-holders-public-service-division-2933006,"SINGAPORE: The Public Service Division (PSD) will raise salaries for administrative service officers and judicial and selected statutory appointment holders by between 5 per cent and 12 per cent from October.
Salaries for these groups were last adjusted about 15 years ago in 2007-2008.
“Since then, gaps with market benchmarks have increased significantly,” PSD said in a news release on Monday (Sep 12). 
“These adjustments will enable the Public Service to continue to attract and retain its fair share of talent for key leadership roles.”
The 5 per cent to 12 per cent increase will “narrow the gaps”, it added. It also said salary ranges will be adjusted.
About 300 administrative officers and 30 judicial and statutory appointment holders will benefit from the revision.
This includes the Chief Justice, judges of the Court of Appeal, Appellate Division and the High Court, as well as Judicial Commissioners.

Jail and caning for man who sexually assaulted 7-year-old cousin after watching pornography,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-and-caning-man-who-sexually-assaulted-7-year-old-cousin-after-watching-pornography-2932896,"SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old man was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years' jail and six strokes of the cane on Monday (Sep 9) for sexually abusing his cousin when she was seven or eight years old.
He was 18 to 19 years old at the time and watched pornography several times a week until he started to think about performing sex acts on the victim, the court heard. 
He would sexually abuse her either at a staircase landing before taking her to a shop downstairs to buy snacks, or at home when no one else was around or looking.
The man cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the identity of the victim, who is now 16.
He pleaded guilty to a charge each of sexual penetration of a minor and using criminal force to outrage her modesty.
Another six charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. These include possession of obscene films, sexual exploitation of a child and sexual penetration of a minor.
The court heard that the victim was the offender's paternal cousin. Sometime in 2012 and 2013, she went to stay with her grandfather as she ""did not receive much care and concern from her parents"", the prosecutor said.
As the girl stayed with her cousins, she had a close relationship with them, including the offender.
According to court documents, the offender began watching pornography at the age of 12 and would do so several times a week on his computer or his phone.
In the period when the victim was staying at his flat, the offender continued to watch porn and began fantasising about performing sex acts on the victim based on the pornography he had watched.
On the first occasion, the girl was home with the offender and their grandparents when the offender asked her to accompany him downstairs to buy snacks.
He took her to a staircase landing and exposed himself to her before forcing her to perform a sex act on him. The victim complied with his instructions without saying anything, as she did not know what was going on. 
The victim felt scared, and the offender knew that she was too young to understand what was happening. He then took her to a shop downstairs where he bought snacks and told her not to tell anyone about what happened.
Over a period of about six months, the offender continued to sexually abuse the girl on at least five occasions, asking her to perform different sex acts on him.
He knew that his cousin was in primary school, but he ""continued to commit these acts as he watched pornography and was curious about engaging in these acts"", said the prosecutor. 
He based his actions on what he learned from watching pornography, she said.
Sometime in 2013, the victim moved out and went back to stay with her family, so the offender could no longer commit the sexual abuse against her. 
The incidents came to light only in June 2020, after the victim attempted suicide due to an unrelated quarrel with her boyfriend. She was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health and later told another cousin what the offender had done. This cousin took the victim to lodge a police report and the offender was arrested.
As a result of the sexual abuse, the victim felt emotional, disgusted and unwanted, the court heard. She also engaged in self-harm.
Defence lawyer Raphael Louis told the court that the prosecution's submitted sentence was fair. 
""The offences are serious. Although my client was young, but it's still serious,"" he said, adding that he agreed with the prosecution's submissions of eight-and-a-half years' jail.
The prosecutor added that she was asking for at least eight-and-a-half to 10 years' jail.
The judge said he had considered the defence's mitigation - which was not elaborated on in open court - as well as the fact that the offender was pleading guilty.
He ordered the offender's phone, which had been seized and found to contain obscene materials, to be forfeited to the police for disposal."
"System outages at healthcare institutions caused by hardware failure, not lack of manpower: Janil Puthucheary ","The two IT system outages on Aug 27 and Sep 5 significantly impacted the operations of public healthcare institutions, said Dr Puthucheary. 
 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2-it-system-outage-healthcare-institutions-ihis-polyclinics-not-manpower-lack-hardware-failure-2932741,"SINGAPORE: The two IT system outages at healthcare institutions last month and earlier this month were caused by failures of hardware devices in data centres, not a lack of manpower, said Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary in Parliament on Monday (Sep 12). 
Dr Puthucheary was responding to questions by MPs on the outages on Aug 27 and Sep 5. 
Patients at some polyclinics had their appointments delayed or rescheduled in the Aug 27 incident, according to a report by the Straits Times. 
Member of Parliament (MP) Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong GRC) asked for a breakdown of the patients affected by the outage, its causes, and how the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) compared against international healthcare institutions, while MP Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (PAP-Jalan Besar) asked for safeguards in place to prevent similar disruptions in the future. 
Detailing the incidents, Dr Puthucheary said that both incidents had caused a ""significant impact on operations"". 
""On both 27th August and 5th September, our affected public healthcare institutions activated their downtime procedures and business continuity plans to keep operations running using alternative systems and in some cases manual documentation.
""These business continuity plans are exercised regularly, and staff were able to switch processes to sustain operations during the outage. But they had to work doubly hard to keep healthcare operations running,"" said the Senior Minister of State.
In the earlier incident, the public healthcare monitoring systems detected IT network connectivity failures from 7am. The faults were rectified and systems restored by 10.45am the same day. In total, 26 IT applications, including electronic medical records, appointment, pharmacy and laboratory systems, were affected. 
A total of 17 public healthcare institutions, including community hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics, and all polyclinics were impacted.
For the second incident on Sep 5, another fault occurred in the IT infrastructure at 10am. Partial functionality was restored from 1pm that day, while full functionality was only restored by 6pm the next day. The disruption affected eight public healthcare institutions and two out of three polyclinic groups, according to Dr Puthucheary. 
Due to the outages, patients had longer waiting times of up to an hour at affected institutions and others had appointments rescheduled. There were also delays in dispensing medication. 
""Fortunately, there was no compromise to urgent care services across the institutions during the IT disruptions. Nobody was turned away from the emergency departments, or denied urgent care,"" he said.

CAUSES OF THE OUTAGES
Investigations into the incidents showed that the main causes were failures of hardware devices in data centres, said Dr Puthucheary. 
In the days leading up to the Aug 27 incident, two nodes - hardware devices which operate in tandem - in firewall zones at data centres failed. 
The system usually has other nodes to manage the load of data traffic to continue service operations if one fails. On Aug 27, as engineers tried to restore the two failed nodes, the operation failed. This caused the cluster of firewall nodes to malfunction, which subsequently caused the outage. 
Dr Puthucheary said that the engineers worked to reset the systems to the prior state without the function of the two affected nodes and service was progressively restored.
 
""The failure of the nodes was caused by bugs in the firmware of the devices. They have since been identified by the manufacturer, CISCO, and the devices have been patched,"" he added. 
The Sep 5 incident was caused by ""the simultaneous failure of two further nodes, again from the same manufacturer, and of the same model"", noted Dr Puthucheary. 
The way the failure occurred was different from the previous incident and more time was needed to restore operations. The cause of this failure is still under investigation.
""There was a suggestion in one of questions from members that the failures may be due to the lack of manpower of IHiS. IHiS has a headcount of 3,500 personnel, they have a lot to do and will always welcome more manpower, but a lack of manpower is not the cause of these failures,"" said the Senior Minister of State. 
He added that there were no indications of security compromise to the affected systems based on investigations. 
In response to Dr Tan's question on whether systems were benchmarked against ""best-in-class"" systems elsewhere, Dr Puthucheary said: ""There are service level agreements about the uptime availability as well as the sort of user interface usability for the products that IHiS manages, and these are indeed benchmarked against best in class around the world."" 
MP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang GRC) asked what assistance was given to affected frontline staff, and if they were provided with training to deal with such circumstances.
In reply, Dr Puthucheary said that support from the Ministry of Health and IHiS centred on ""communication and providing clear information about what has happened, what are the expected steps taken to restore functionality, (and) how much time will be required"".
The healthcare institutions also mobilised staff to deal with the outages and the extra processes involved, said Dr Puthucheary. 
""Is training provided? Yes, business continuity plans ... disaster recovery plans are drilled regularly in the healthcare units and teams and are part of standard training for all the healthcare workers that are in our public healthcare sector. And the training is updated on a regular basis.
""This is not something that is standardised in every team and in every unit across the healthcare ecosystem because these are peculiar to the operations and flows within each clinical team."""
"Singapore cannot rely on 'sentiment-driven' collections for expenditure needs, GST hike to go ahead: Lawrence Wong","Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong was responding to questions from MPs on whether the increase in tax revenue collected in FY2021/22 could help to defer the planned GST hike.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gst-hike-tax-collection-revenue-increase-inflation-dpm-finance-minister-lawrence-wong-2932696,"SINGAPORE: Singapore cannot rely on ""sentiment-driven"" collections such as stamp-duties as a stable and sustainable source of revenue to meet rising recurrent expenditure needs, said Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Sep 12).
Speaking in Parliament, Mr Wong, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, noted that such revenues can fluctuate from year to year.
He was responding to questions from Members of Parliament on whether the increase in tax revenue that was collected in FY2021/22 could help to defer the planned Goods and Services Tax hike in 2023 and 2024.
The GST is set to rise from 7 per cent to 8 per cent in 2023, and to further increase to 9 per cent in 2024.
A total of S$60.7 billion in tax revenue was collected in FY2021/22, a 22.4 per cent jump from the previous year as the economy rebounded following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
The increase came on the back of a lower base in the previous year due to the pandemic, when tax revenue fell by 7.3 per cent, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) said in a news release last month.
Additionally, the increase was also driven by higher-than-expected collections of ""sentiment-based"" revenue, said Mr Wong. He pointed out that stamp duty collection accounted for the largest share of the tax revenue increase in FY2021/22.

""The property market has recovered at a much faster rate than many market observers had anticipated. But just as a bullish property market can provide upsides, there can also be downsides in the muted market, as past experience has shown,"" said Mr Wong.
""We have used the higher tax revenue in FY2021 to support new spending needs, including the enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit scheme, as well as to provide short term relief for businesses and families. These include our COVID-19 support packages during periods of heightened restrictions last year, and measures to help Singaporeans with cost of living support this year.""
HIGHER HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES
In his reply, Mr Wong also responded to a question on whether the GST hike could be deferred on account of rising inflation.
""The Government shares Singaporeans' concerns over inflation. Over the past decade, Singaporean workers have experienced real wage growth. Wages have exceeded inflation,"" he said.
""We do not have real wage growth figures for 2022 yet, as the data will only be available later this year. But we know that inflation has gone up in this year and that is why the Government will continue to provide support for Singaporeans to mitigate the impact of higher prices.""
Besides measures announced in this year's Budget, Mr Wong noted that the Government announced a S$1.5 billion support package in June with more support given to the lower- income and vulnerable groups.

""While we deal with these immediate cost pressures, we have also been working with employers and unions to help our companies and workers become more productive and competitive. This is important to sustain real wage growth over time,"" he added.
""We will also continue to uplift the wages of low wage workers by expanding the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors and to raise the wages of lower wage workers, along with enhancements to their skills and productivity.""
Mr Wong noted that Singapore's growing spending needs are largely driven by higher healthcare expenditures owing to an ageing population.
The country also needs to accelerate its economic and green transformation and ""shore up resilience"" in essentials like food and energy amid global economic uncertainty, he added.

Applicants for new work pass to attract top talent will be carefully vetted: Manpower Minister,"Safeguards will be put in place to ensure that the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, the new work pass for top talent with a salary threshold of S$30,000, is not abused, says Manpower Minister Tan See Leng.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ep-overseas-networks-expertise-pass-work-foreign-talent-policy-2932656,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will put in place safeguards to ensure that a new work pass for top talent is not abused, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Monday (Aug 12).
Dr Tan delivered a ministerial statement on Monday on strengthening Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent in response to dozens of questions from Members of Parliament on recent changes to the work pass framework.
There were 24 parliamentary questions raised seeking more details on new schemes to attract global talent, and on Singapore’s efforts to develop local talent.
For instance, Mr Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines), Ms He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang), Mr Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) and Mr Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked about the checks that would be put in place to prevent abuse or fraudulent applications for the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, a new five-year work pass with a salary threshold of S$30,000 or more.





      Changes to Work Pass Framework
  

1. Singapore will launch a new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, for talent earning at least S$30,000 in fixed monthly salary, comparable to the top 5 per cent of existing Employment Pass holders, or with outstanding achievements in arts and culture, sports, and research and academia.
The pass will be for five years, compared to the current two years for new EP applicants, and it is not tied to a job role in Singapore. The pass holders can concurrently work for a few companies or start their own business. 
They can sponsor their dependents and their spouses can work with a letter of consent. This scheme starts on Jan 1, 2023.
2. There will be a new benchmark pegged to the top 10 per cent of EP holders for existing schemes, namely the exemption from the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) job advertising requirement and COMPASS, as well salary criterion for the Personalised Employment Pass.
This is set at S$22,500 and will start in September 2023.
3. From Sep 1, 2022, MOM restored the FCF job advertising duration from 28 days to 14 days. The ministry also shortened the processing time of EP applications.
4. There will be an option for five-year EPs to be issued to experienced professionals filling tech occupations on the COMPASS Shortage Occupation List, from September 2023.

Dr Tan said that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) already conducts back-end checks to sieve out potential cases of false salary declarations. 
This includes scrutinising applications from companies with a limited track record, and asking for more documents to verify that the salary declared will be paid. This will be applied to all Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass applications.
For those seeking to convert from an existing employment pass, MOM will scrutinise their income tax filings with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore to ensure the taxes filed are consistent with their application.
For overseas candidates, MOM will further assess their company’s market capitalisation and revenue based on verifiable sources. The economic agencies will support MOM in this, said Dr Tan.

DEFINING OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT
After the application is approved, MOM will continue to engage the pass holders during their time in Singapore. 
“(This is) so we will be up to date with their professional activities and annual income. This will factor into our assessment on their eligibility for renewal,” said Dr Tan.
Answering a question from Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) on whether the S$30,000 monthly salary criterion can be drawn from multiple employers, Dr Tan said that in general, it must be from one employer.
For overseas candidates, the previous or prospective employer must also have a market capitalisation of at least US$500 million or an annual revenue of at least US$200 million.
But applicants who do not meet this salary threshold can also apply if they have outstanding achievements in the fields of arts, sports, science or academia.
Mr Mohd Fahmi (PAP-Pasir Ris Punggol) and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh (WP-Aljunied) asked for the criteria for how such talent will be assessed.
Dr Tan said: “(These individuals) can help us push new frontiers, draw in greater investments and interest to grow our local ecosystem, and most importantly, create a diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans.”
Giving an example in sports, Dr Tan said such talent would include current and former world-class top-ranked athletes who may wish to set up commercial operations or training bases in Singapore, from which local athletes, coaches and the sports ecosystem here can benefit.
He added that MOM will work with sector agencies that are experts in these domains, such as the Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth, the National Arts Council, the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation to “identify such exceptional talent”.





NO TIME LIMIT FOR EMPLOYMENT, SPOUSES CAN WORK
Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa from the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) also asked why there is no time limit requiring these applicants to remain employed. 
“Let me be very clear. The Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass is not meant to be abused as a visit or travel document,” said Dr Tan. 
“MOM reserves the right to cancel the pass if there are extended periods of economic inactivity with no good reasons.”
But Dr Tan said that the top talent on this pass are given flexibilities because MOM wants to encourage them to “take risks, explore new frontiers and make a big impact to benefit Singapore”. 
“It is important to allow them some ramp-up period for that to happen, and not be too quick to jump to the conclusion that they are not contributing,” he said.
Other flexibilities that the pass holders will enjoy are that there are no restrictions on the occupations they can work in, and their spouses can work with a letter of consent.
Dr Tan said that the longer five-year duration of the pass, as well as the letter of consent (LOC) for spouses, is meant to give top talent “additional assurance” when they are deciding whether to come to Singapore. 
“Businesses tell us that these are key factors top talent consider when deciding where to go,” he said.

He added that the policy for the dependents of other EP holders remain unchanged – they are eligible to work in Singapore if they obtain a work pass, but the exception is made for top talent as other territories give their dependents work privileges.
“We stopped issuing LOCs to dependants, not because we did not want them to work here, but because it made sense to hold them to a similar bar as all other foreigners,” he said.
“But when we are talking about top talent, we must be mindful of how global, how mobile they are, and how stiff the competition is for them. Many other jurisdictions – including Hong Kong, the UAE and the UK – offer work privileges for dependents.”
“When people make major relocation decisions, it is usually a family decision. Without certainty for the spouse, these talents may choose to go elsewhere.”
As a proxy, among the top 5 per cent of existing EP holders that might qualify for the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, only a minority have spouses who are working, he said.
“But in terms of the signal we are giving to top talent, it is absolutely material and absolutely needle-moving.”

“MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE TREES”
Dr Tan also clarified that there will be no quota for the issue of such passes, in reply to questions by Mr Mohd Fahmi, Mr Singh and Ms He.
“We are not setting a quota, and the reason is this – if we accept that there is never enough of top talent to go around the world, then it does not make sense to limit the amount of talent we bring in,” said Dr Tan. 
“If we impose a quota, we are essentially putting a hard limit on how strongly we can compete at the high-end of the global economy. This ultimately hurts Singaporeans, who will have fewer opportunities.”
To give a sense of numbers, Dr Tan said that 5 per cent of Singapore EP holders would be around 8,000 people.
""But the focus is not on the numbers – because we are focusing on quality rather than quantity,"" he said.
Given the “highly selective” nature of the scheme, there is no risk of a “deluge” of people coming in to Singapore through the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, he added.
Answering MPs’ questions on how the pass would benefit Singaporeans and what the expected impact on local employment is, Dr Tan said that the relationship between talent, innovation and economic growth is more than a “simple, linear one”. 
“The contributions of talented individuals go beyond a set of key performance indicators. Limiting and reducing it to that risks constraining us to a yardstick of measurements and missing the forest for the trees.”
Giving some examples, he said that some pass holders may be employees, making it possible to bring a new business unit to Singapore, or grow a new line of business.
Others may set up companies of their own, and others may be here to teach, advise or consult for local enterprises, enabling them to share their expertise with Singaporean business owners and professionals, he said.
“We are building a rich network of markets, people and ideas, that over time, shows up in the dynamism of our economy,” he said. 
“And if, at the macro level, local job creation remains strong, unemployment low, real income growth sustained, and if, amongst our people, there is always a sense of hope and of opportunities – then I think we would have succeeded.”
He said that local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will benefit too by directly hiring the Overseas Network & Expertise Pass holders, tapping on pass holders’ expertise through consulting services, or inviting them to join their boards.
“Just as importantly, a vibrant, growing economy will create more business opportunities or build a new ecosystem for our SMEs who may be partners, contractors, suppliers or service providers,” Dr Tan said.
“This may be in up-and-coming sectors such as the green economy or FinTech, where there will be new cheese for our SMEs.”
HELPING LOCALS COMPETE 
Dr Tan said that Singapore’s policies to attract global talent are also meant to accelerate the development of the local talent pool.
“We have designed our foreign workforce policies to incentivise companies to develop a strong local workforce – COMPASS, for instance, takes into account a firm’s local PMET (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) share when evaluating its EP applications,” he said.
“We will complement this with investments in our local workers, to help them succeed.”
COMPASS or the Complementarity Assessment Framework kicks in in September 2023.
Besides looking at a work pass applicant’s qualifications, it will take into account other factors like the diversity of nationalities among a firm’s PMETs and its support for local employment. It will not apply to the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass and job roles with salary levels at or above S$22,500.

Dr Tan said that the Industry Transformation Maps mapped out growth plans for 23 sectors across the economy, and for each sector, MOM identified in-demand jobs and developed jobs and skills strategies to build up the local talent pipeline for these jobs.
There are also Jobs Transformation Maps to provide job-level insights on the impact of technology on the industry and workforce, which companies can use to redesign and enhance job roles, and equip their workers with the skills needed for these roles.
“Working closely with industry and unions, the Government has spared no effort to help employers and workers to upskill and reskill for jobs of the future. 
“A wide range of programmes are offered by Workforce Singapore, SkillsFuture Singapore and the various sector agencies to support training,” he said.
There are also many schemes to help develop local business leaders, such as the Asian Financial Leaders Scheme that co-funds and sends promising Singaporeans in the financial sector on leadership programmes.
Other similar schemes include a new Singapore Global Executive Programme, the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative, and Enterprise Singapore’s Global Ready Talent Programme, said the minister.
On skills transfer to build up local expertise, Dr Tan said that companies have programmes to get more experienced employees, foreign or local, to transfer skills to less experienced employees. 
The companies can also tap on various government programmes, including SkillsFuture, the Enterprise Development Grant and the Capability Transfer Programme.
SKILLS TRANSFER
Replying to a question from Assoc Prof Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) on whether the Government can “codify” training and skills transfer requirements into law, Dr Tan cautioned against “too deterministic an approach”.
“Skills transfer is but one way that foreign manpower can contribute to Singapore and create opportunities for Singaporeans,” said Dr Tan.
“In some areas, foreign manpower helps to make up the gap between demand and supply – some of these gaps can persist due to local and global trends, for instance, the global lack of digital talent.”
Furthermore, skills transfer is not a “simple, linear process”.
“It would be impossible to come up with a single rule on how long it should take for skills to be transferred from one person to another, or how much skills to transfer, for that matter.”
Singapore’s approach is not to set a mandatory requirement for skills transfer, but to put in place “the right ecosystem” of policies to motivate businesses to select complementary foreign workers, while building up a “strong Singaporean Core”, Dr Tan said.
“This includes keeping a tight labour market through regular updates to our work pass criteria, alongside significant investments to help our workforce upskill and reskill.”
""NEW CHEESE"" 
Responding to supplementary questions about the work pass framework changes, Dr Tan reiterated that the changes aim to grow Singapore's ecosystem as a whole by ""creating new cheese"", creating spillover benefits for local companies and local workers.
""This measure will strengthen our standing as an international hub for talent. It will bring significantly more businesses for our local companies, especially our SMEs, and increase the opportunities for all of our Singaporean workers,"" he said. 
NCMP Leong Mun Wai (PSP) asked the minister whether Singapore has been attracting the right kind of talent, and if the ministry can better monitor and encourage skills transfer, mentoring of local workers by foreign talent. Mr Singh also asked a similar question on skills transfer. 
""With the introduction of the ONE Pass and several changes to the employment pass framework as announced by the minister, how does the ministry intend to promote and track the transfer of skills to Singaporeans, by employment pass holders such as the ONE Pass?"" he said, referring to the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass by an acronym.
Dr Tan said that the Government has given significant SkillsFuture subsidies, and has many skills upgrading programmes for local workers. 
Giving the example of the Capability Transfer Programme (CTP), Dr Tan said that funding support is provided to companies to acquire global capabilities that are not available in Singapore, through ways such as bringing foreign specialists into Singapore to train locals or sending locals overseas for training.
""Since its inception in 2017, it has benefited more than 140 companies and more than 1,000 locals. Our locals have experienced expanded job scopes as they have acquired new skills.""
Elaborating on his point about creating new business opportunities in Singapore, he said: ""I think we are now at the stage where we are not only looking at skill sets alone ... more so than the proxy of the S$30,000 mark, we're looking at creating a significantly different ecosystem,"" he said.
""One that will hopefully ensure our continued prosperity and progress for the next five or 10 decades and beyond.""
To another question from Mr Choo on whether the changes are sufficient to help Singapore attract its fair share of talent and help companies to grow, Dr Tan said that Singapore is starting from a ""position of strength"".
""We looked at potential new enterprises that we see ourselves getting our first-mover and our competitive advantage in; and we are going after those sectors where we are going to be able to create new cheese for ourselves.
""And with that new cheese provide significant economic opportunities to benefit our entire ecosystem of small-medium enterprises and raising up our Singapore core."""
Rule adjustments for new talent work pass not a relaxation of existing policies: Tan See Leng,"In a ministerial statement on Monday (Sep 12), Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said the changes will help to set a ""clearer benchmark for existing schemes”, send ""the right signal"" to global companies on Singapore’s openness and are also in tandem with changes in the local labour market.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-talent-work-pass-not-relaxation-manpower-tan-see-leng-2932591,"SINGAPORE: The setting of a new salary benchmark and other planned changes that will be made alongside the introduction of a new talent work pass do not constitute a relaxation of existing policies, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Monday (Sep 12).
Dr Tan was responding to parliamentary questions about the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass – a new work pass that will be introduced to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global talent hub.
The work pass is meant for talent from any sector who earns a monthly salary of S$30,000 and above, or has “outstanding achievements” in the areas of science and technology, arts and culture, research and academia, or sports, authorities said.
It will be rolled out alongside other adjustments to Singapore’s work pass framework.
For instance, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will set a single benchmark for the top 10 per cent of Employment Pass (EP) holders, and the salary threshold for a number of requirements for work pass applications will be aligned to this. The new threshold is set at $22,500 and will start in September 2023.
This will affect advertising for a job opening under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the new Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS).
FCF advertising refers to a requirement for companies here to advertise a job opening for a specified time period before hiring a non-local, while COMPASS is a new points system for EP applicants that will kick in from Sep 1 next year.
Currently, if the monthly salary for a particular position is S$20,000 or more, companies do not have to advertise under FCF and the candidate is exempt from COMPASS requirements. This will be adjusted upwards to S$22,500.
Dr Tan, in a ministerial statement, described these as “highly-targeted enhancements” that are aimed at attracting top talent in diverse fields and experienced tech professionals in areas of skills shortages. They will also help give the country “significant first-mover and sustainable competitive advantages” in new growth areas.
He added: “The new benchmark for existing schemes, including the exemption from the Fair Consideration Framework, or FCF job advertising requirement, and COMPASS – let me clarify that this is not a relaxation of our policies.”

The new salary benchmark, with a higher threshold for exemption at S$22,500, aims “to set a clearer benchmark for existing schemes”. 
“This will give our businesses predictability on future updates, and to ensure that our mainstream framework continues to cover the vast majority of EP applications even as wages move up,” the minister said.
Responding to a question from Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh about exemptions from FCF job advertising rules and COMPASS, Dr Tan explained that the top 10 per cent of EP holders mostly consist of senior management and senior professionals.
Companies would already have a stringent selection process for such roles, he said. It is also likely that headhunters will be involved in the recruitment process and that it is “not typical” for these roles to be filled by advertising on job portals like MyCareersFuture.sg.
Individuals for these roles also would “have no problems” passing the COMPASS criteria given their calibre, the minister added.
“Providing this exemption is therefore not a major concession on our part,” Dr Tan stressed, noting that it instead helps to “send the right signal” to global companies on Singapore’s openness.
“These global companies are a key driver in creating good jobs for locals, including opportunities for them to take on higher-level positions. Many locals have taken on these opportunities,” he added.

Commentary: Will new work pass make top talent ‘sit up, pay attention’ to Singapore?













Other Members of Parliament (MPs) asked about planned adjustments for the FCF job advertising duration, which applies to all EP and S Pass applications.
MP Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) asked if a shorter duration of 14 days would remove the need for employers to exhaust all avenues to hire local PMEs, while MPs Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang) and Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) asked for more data regarding the efficacy of the FCF job advertising requirement.
On that, Dr Tan said the FCF job advertising requirement was set at 14 days when it was first introduced in 2014. This was because, based on data from MyCareerFutures.sg, the majority of job applications were submitted within the first two weeks of a job posting.
Authorities later extended the job advertisement rule to 28 days during the COVID-19 pandemic due to “unprecedented slack in the labour market”.
Noting that the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons reached a low of 0.55 in June 2020, the minister said: “We wanted to give local jobseekers more time to respond to job openings and employers more time to evaluate the increased number of applications.”
The situation has since reversed, Dr Tan continued, pointing out that the ratio of vacancies to unemployed persons has risen to more than 2.4, meaning there are now more jobs than local jobseekers.
“Companies, including local enterprises, have been giving feedback that in the tight labour market, the 28-day requirement is causing them to lose good candidates because they are unable to offer them employment contracts quickly,” he added, noting that it is “timely” for the adjustment back to 14 days.
“But members of the House make no mistake, employers are still expected to fairly consider all applicants who apply within this window. This remains unchanged, and our employers understand this,” he said.
MOM will also be introducing a five-year EP to experienced professionals filling tech jobs requiring highly specialised skills currently in shortage in the local workforce.
These will be specified in the upcoming COMPASS Shortage Occupation List. They also have to earn a salary of at least S$10,500, and are subject to COMPASS criteria.
Dr Tan said authorities have decided to limit this to tech roles for the time being, given the acute shortage of talent globally.
“But that is not to say that other sectors cannot benefit. Almost all sectors require tech talent to drive transformation. This includes the financial services and manufacturing industries, as well as up-and-coming sustainability sectors,” he said in response to a question from MP Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) about whether this can be extended to non-tech professionals in the sustainability sector.
“We are watching the sustainability space closely as it develops, and we will refine our policies when needed,” the minister added."
260 hoarding cases remain unresolved due to difficulty in gaining hoarders’ cooperation: MND,"After a fire in a Jurong East flat last month, SCDF said the firefighting operation was ""very challenging"" as it contained debris that was closely packed from wall to wall.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hoarding-cases-protracted-unresolved-complex-cooperation-mental-health-2932581,"SINGAPORE: The authorities are working on 260 active hoarding cases that remain ""protracted and unresolved"" because it is difficult to gain hoarders' cooperation to declutter, said Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann on Monday (Sep 12). 
""Frontline officers face real tensions on the ground in balancing between the person’s individual right to choose how they want to upkeep their own home and their neighbours’ enjoyment of their own residences, especially in cases where the clutter falls short of outright legal violations, or do not meet the threshold for public health and safety risks as determined by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the National Environment Agency (NEA),"" Ms Sim said in Parliament.
Ms Sim was answering questions by Members of Parliament (MPs) on how cases of hoarding in HDB estates have changed under the Hoarding Management Framework and how the authorities will deal with those that pose a risk of fire hazards.
The questions from the MPs follow fires at HDB flats last month, including one at Jurong East Street 21 where a man died.
SCDF previously said that the firefighting and damping down operation for that incident was ""very challenging"" as the entire unit contained a large volume of debris that was closely packed from ""wall to wall"".
Ms Sim noted in her reply that the Government takes an interagency approach towards hoarding due to its complexity and the potentially fatal public hazards. 
The Hoarding Management Core Group (HMCG) was set up in 2014 to coordinate efforts across the agencies. It comprises agencies such as the NEA, SCDF and HDB, among others.
Hoarding cases are assessed and prioritised based on whether there is a threat to public health and safety under the Hoarding Management Framework, said Ms Sim. Where risks are identified to the extent that rules and laws are violated, regulatory agencies will issue orders or take enforcement action on the hoarder or homeowner.
ROOT CAUSE
Ms Sim said: ""The root cause of a hoarder’s behaviour is complex. For example, one’s hoarding could be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or developed after experiencing trauma or deep grief.""
Hoarding behaviour could be worsened by social factors, such as family disputes or the stockpiling of collected items at home for a rag-and-bone business. 
If a hoarder is suspected to have mental health issues, they will be referred to the Agency for Integrated Care and the Institute of Mental Health for professional assessment and treatment, said Ms Sim. 
""Agencies work closely with healthcare workers, community partners, such as social workers, Family Service Centres, grassroots leaders, volunteers and the hoarder's family members in a concerted effort to resolve hoarding cases,"" she added.
She noted that even with the involvement of mental health agencies and professionals, these issues may still result in the recurrence of hoarding as behavioural change is ""unlikely to happen overnight"".

Despite the difficulties in dealing with hoarding cases, Ms Sim noted that the HMCG has managed to reduce the severity of 210 cases as of the first half of this year. The group continues to monitor these cases to prevent any recurrence. 
For some cases that remain protracted and unresolved, officers need to get the cooperation of the hoarder to help them declutter.
This involves repeated engagements, persuasion, and sometimes, referrals to social workers or mental health professionals, said Ms Sim.
""We have encountered cases where hoarders refuse to open their door for inspections or cooperate in decluttering. Some may even threaten self-harm at the thought of losing their belongings,"" she added.
""Even if their homes were successfully decluttered once, the clutter may recur as habits do not change so quickly.""
Ms Sim said that the authorities plan to intensify actions to keep corridors clear for passage.
""We will also continue to tackle known cases of egregious hoarding within flats. We will work with agencies to assess the risks posed by the worst hoarding cases.
""Where orders are issued for public health and safety reasons and hoarders are cooperative, we will proceed to declutter via the community-based approach with the assistance of volunteer groups,"" she said.

MPS' SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS
MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok SMC) asked if residents would know which agency led coordinated efforts and who residents would approach for steps taken against hoarders. 
Ms Sim replied that while the HMCG was a multi-agency effort, Housing Development Board officers, grassroots advisors, town council staff or those who raised the alert, were usually interacting with residents on the ground. 
""As for documentation, within HMCG the various agencies consulted depending on the specific details of the case would contribute their inputs and at the HCMG level we will be keeping a record of all the various cases,"" Ms Sim added. 
MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied GRC) asked if there was a need to deploy more trained and experienced officers to lead the engagement with hoarders, and to have paid workers clear clutter so that it can be done faster. He also asked if more resources will be put into this issue. 
Ms Sim said that professional officers were involved. ""The key, though, is very often to obtain entry and cooperation, especially in the cases where the level of cluttering or hoarding falls short of outright legal violations,"" she noted. 
""In terms of the enforcement levers within HMCG, we do and will continue to work very closely first with technical agencies whose professional assessment we rely upon to determine whether or not a legal order can be issued.""
MP Gan Thiam Poh (PAP-Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked if there was a time frame for the enforcement order. 
Ms Sim said, ""Within HMCG we already have a framework. And as I have also shared with members just now, we have managed to see progress in some of the cases. I understand that members, especially those who have witnessed or who have been handling hoarding cases in your own wards, would also like to see more speedy resolution. This is also a goal that we share.""
Mr Gan also asked what else can the ministry do in cases which have gone unresolved for years. He raised the case of a family in which one member hoards, risking the safety of the others. 
Ms Sim said: ""We will also seek to have intensified ground actions, because I think it's important that we do the clearance for instance of corridors together in a more concerted way such that there would be, first, broader understanding of the importance of clear passages.
""There will also be some increased understanding in hoarding and what are the factors surrounding it."""
Ex-directors of gold investment firm get jail for fraudulent multimillion-dollar buyback scheme,"The Gold Label drew more than 2,000 customers in its gold buyback business between 2009 and 2011.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gold-label-jailed-ponzi-scheme-buyback-court-ex-directors-2932621,"SINGAPORE: Two former directors of a company that sold gold bars in a buyback arrangement which turned out to be a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme were sentenced to jail on Monday (Sep 12).
Iseli Rudolf James Maitland, 63, and How Soo Feng, 48, were each given three years and 10 months' jail for fraudulent trading.
They were found guilty of a charge each of being a party to a business for the fraudulent purpose of selling gold bars under a scheme promising returns.
The company, The Gold Label, ran a gold buyback business between 2009 and 2011. The firm sold gold bars to its customers at a premium of more than 20 per cent above prevailing gold market prices in contracts lasting three or six months.
In exchange, customers were promised guaranteed returns as high as 24 per cent per annum. At the end of the contract period, customers could sell the gold bars back to The Gold Label at the same price that they had bought the gold bars.
In theory, this allowed customers to recoup their initial investment amount in full while making guaranteed returns, creating a semblance of risk-free investment with attractive returns.
During its operations, The Gold Label drew more than 2,000 customers and accumulated sales of about S$150 million.
However, the company had no profit-generating business, nor any sustainable means to honour the payment and buyback obligations owed to its customers. Instead, it relied entirely on new sales proceeds from subsequent customers to pay obligations owed to earlier customers.
In October 2010, within a year of starting its sale of gold bars, the company filed to wind up, and had a total liability of S$85.3 million at the time.
By then, its payout and buyback obligations to its customers had amounted to more than S$85 million.
Both Maitland and How had contested the charges. At trial, they argued that the company had a formula which could generate sufficient profits for the firm to honour its obligations.
However, the court found that there was no such formula and that the pair knew this from the start.
""The timing of the winding up seems to indicate that their decision was not borne out of benevolence to save their clients, but desperation to cover up the Ponzi scheme that was soon to be exposed,"" said the judge.
Maitland was allowed to defer his jail term to Sep 29.
For fraudulent trading under the Companies Act, the pair could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$15,000, or both.
A third former director, Wong Kwan Sing, had been sentenced to two years and 10 months jail in January. He was nabbed after absconding to Malaysia."
SCDF to trial placing fire extinguisher at lift lobby of every other HDB block,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fire-extinguisher-hdb-scdf-2932516,"SINGAPORE: A new trial by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will give public housing residents better access to fire extinguishers during emergencies.
These extinguishers, which will be placed at lift lobbies, will be installed and maintained by SCDF, Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim told Parliament on Monday (Sep 12).
""SCDF is embarking on a trial with HDB, town councils and Temasek Foundation to place and maintain one fire extinguisher at a lift lobby of every two HDB blocks for use by residents during fire emergencies,"" he said.

Resident killed in fire at Jurong East flat, 3 others rescued from unit next door



















SCDF to assess if more measures needed after fire reignited in Jurong East flat where resident was killed













Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said in a written reply to Parliament in February 2018 that HDB installs fire extinguishers at community spaces in common areas, in rooms housing utilities services and in commercial facilities.
The current number and prevalence of fire extinguishers at HDB blocks are unclear. 
""The SCDF encourages the installation of fire extinguishers in homes on a voluntary basis, instead of making it mandatory, as they are expensive and difficult to maintain,"" Mr Shanmugam wrote.
""If necessary, residents can also use the hose reels that are provided in the common areas of HDB blocks to put out incipient fires.""
Associate Professor Faishal said SCDF, through public engagement programmes, has also been educating residents on the use of fire extinguishers.
""Through these platforms, SCDF encourages residents to install fire extinguishers in their premises on a voluntary basis and also shares information on the locations where hose reels can be found in the common areas,"" he added.
Assoc Prof Faishal was responding to questions from several MPs on the installation of fire warning devices in HDB flats, including one by Ms Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) on whether the ministry would consider placing fire extinguishers along the common corridor of specified floors for each HDB block.
On Aug 16, an HDB resident was killed after a fire broke out in a flat at Block 236, Jurong East Street 21. About a day later, a fire reignited in the master bedroom of the same flat despite firefighters carrying out damping-down operations - the application of water to burnt surfaces to prevent fires from rekindling.
Assoc Prof Faishal said on Monday that the number of fires in HDB estates continues to decrease annually, and that the fire fatality rate remains low.
There were three fire fatalities in 2021, all from residential fire incidents in Ang Mo Kio, Yishun and Woodlands.
HOME FIRE ALARM DEVICE
Ms Ong also asked for an update on the installation of home fire alarm devices for all HDB public rental flats, under an assistance scheme that provided free installation for these residents on a non-mandatory basis.
Since June 2018, all new homes and existing homes that undergo fire safety works have to install these devices, which warn occupants of a fire so that they can extinguish the flames or evacuate the flat.
However, it is not mandatory for existing residential premises not carrying out fire safety works to install the devices.
Assoc Prof Faishal replied that the scheme to install the devices in public rental flats was completed in June 2021, and that the take-up rate then was 75 per cent.
HDB will progressively install the devices in the remaining public rental flats when their tenants’ leases end, he said, adding that the Home Affairs Ministry currently does not intend to expand the scheme.
FIRE-RATED DOORS 
MP Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) also asked if the policy on the installation of fire-rated doors at HDB flats can be reviewed to allow more pervasive use of such doors.
The Fire Code currently requires fire-rated entrance doors for residential units, except where the residential unit faces an external corridor, as such corridors have been assessed to sufficiently facilitate heat and smoke dissipation, Assoc Prof Faishal said.
Other fire safety requirements for residential buildings include adequate exit staircases for the swift evacuation of occupants, fire engine access roads and rising mains for firefighting operations.
Assoc Prof Faishal said SCDF regularly reviews the Fire Code with stakeholders from other Government agencies, industry and academia.
One example of a change in the code is a requirement for new residential buildings exceeding 24m in habitable height to have an apron wall or horizontal ledge on the building facade to minimise the risk of vertical fire spread, he said.
Ms Foo then highlighted that based on her residents' accounts, a ""significant"" number of households that have existing fire-rated doors are being offered non-fire-rated doors as replacements under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP).
She asked if these residents could choose to keep their fire-rated doors even if the prevailing Fire Code does not require the use of such doors.
Assoc Prof Faishal replied that the HIP offers fire-rated doors in accordance with the Fire Code, although residents who wish to keep these doors can do so at a subsidised cost.
""The resident will have the option to change his or her existing fire-rated door to a new one at a subsidised cost,"" he said.
""Residents may opt to install fire-rated doors even where this is not required under the Fire Code, but this would be at their own expense ... What is key is that if the Fire Code does not require fire-rated doors, these additional costs will not be covered under the HIP."""
Singapore Parliament observes one minute of silence as a mark of respect to Queen Elizabeth II,"""Queen Elizabeth had a unique role in Singapore's history,"" said Leader of the House Indranee Rajah.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/queen-elizabeth-death-singapore-parliament-observes-1-minute-silence-2932586,"SINGAPORE: Parliament on Monday (Sep 12) observed one minute of silence as a mark of respect to Queen Elizabeth II, with Leader of the House Indranee Rajah noting that she was queen during Singapore's transition from a crown colony to an independent country.

She added that there has always been a ""reciprocal relationship of warmth and affection"" between Queen Elizabeth II and Singapore. The queen made three state visits to Singapore (1972, 1989 and 2006).
""Beyond the formality and ceremonials involved in state visits, the queen took the time and effort to get to know ordinary Singaporeans better,"" Ms Indranee pointed out.
""In 1972, she visited Toa Payoh where she met Mr Thomas Pung and his family in their HDB flat. They graciously invited her into their home and offered her a drink - a glass of 7-Up. Thirty-four years later, in 2006, on her third state visit, she visited the Pungs again.""

Queenstown - Singapore's first satellite town, and Queen Elizabeth Walk, were named to commemorate her coronation in 1953, she pointed out.
""Places and roads in Queenstown are named after places in Scotland where she spent time during her childhood, such as Strathmore, Forfar and Stirling. Princess Elizabeth Primary School in Bukit Batok was also named after her,"" said Ms Indranee.
""We have kept these place and school names. They record parts of our history and reflect our continued high regard for her late Majesty and our enduring friendly relations with the United Kingdom.""
Ultimately, Queen Elizabeth's death marks the ""end of an era"", said Ms Indranee.
""On behalf of this House, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to his Majesty King Charles III and the Royal Family and to the people of the United Kingdom on the passing of her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,"" she added."
Phoon Chiu Yoke withdraws bid to leave for China after arguments about quarantine and visa requirements,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/phoon-chiu-yoke-withdraws-bid-leave-singapore-china-quarantine-maskless-covid-19-2932556,"SINGAPORE: A woman facing charges for not wearing a mask has withdrawn her request to leave the country for China, after making arguments in court about visa and quarantine requirements.
Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, had received fresh charges last week for failing to wear a mask on Orchard Road a few weeks before outdoor mask rules were relaxed. She was also given a third charge of failing to turn up for a related investigation.
After the charges were tendered, Phoon returned to court asking for permission to leave Singapore for travel to China via Hong Kong. She told the judge that she did not have to undergo quarantine, and claimed she did not need a visa.
On Monday (Sep 12), two prosecutors objected to Phoon's request, calling her a flight risk. They also said that there are quarantine and visa requirements, despite what Phoon claimed.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Jane Lim said there is ""some flight risk involved"", as Phoon has no employment in Singapore and no property here.
""She is currently staying in a rented apartment alone,"" said Ms Lim. ""We also note, your honour, that while she has family members in Singapore - her aged parents and brother - she does not stay with them.""
She added that there was no emergency and nothing in the application to show that Phoon needs to travel. There are also gaps in the documentation provided, said Ms Lim.
""There does not seem to be any evidence on how she is going to get into China from Hong Kong,"" said Ms Lim. ""Based on searches we have done, there seem to be a need for quarantine orders in both these countries. For China in particular, there needs to be a special pass - the APEC visa, or visit pass - which has not been furnished by the accused.""

Phoon Chiu Yoke seeks court's green light to leave Singapore after being charged again for not wearing mask













The judge told Phoon that it is not the duty of the court to ensure that she complies with travel policies or requirements for each country she wishes to travel to.
""But of course, if I do see that there are difficulties in you even being able to enter the country, then the question is whether or not I should even grant the application to begin with,"" said the judge.
Phoon repeatedly said she had ""made the checks"" and was not required to quarantine. All she had to do was to provide a negative PCR and COVID-19 test and provide proof of vaccination.
She said there was no documentation for how she was going to leave Hong Kong for China as she intended to book a ferry or take a train, neither of which could be done online.
Phoon stressed that she is not a flight risk, adding that she has a ""good standing reputation (as) an ex-military officer"".
""While I have family and friends in Singapore, there's no reason for me to leave and not return to Singapore,"" said Phoon. 
The judge stood down the case for her to show proof on the websites she claimed to have checked that she did not require quarantine in China.
When Phoon returned after half an hour, she told the judge that she did not ""create this trip"" because of her fresh charges or hearing.
""I am not running away from this case,"" she said, adding that she merely wanted to continue her travel plans as she had already made prior hotel and ticket reservations.
""Mentally I am prepared to go to Xinjiang for leisure and business,"" said Phoon.
""Now you say it's for business. Perhaps you should show the business itinerary. It's not for me to find out all these for you,"" said the judge.
Phoon answered: ""Every time I travel, it's also to update my photo portal. It's a photo portal I run for myself. In some instances, for charity purposes. You can say it is partially business.""
She disagreed with the prosecution that there is a requirement for a visa for travel to China.
After repeated back-and-forth exchanges in this manner, Phoon said she would withdraw her application to leave the country.
She will return to court in October for a pre-trial conference. Asked what she intends to do with the charges, Phoon said she intends to plead guilty and provide a mitigation."
"Woman imported sausages to sell on Facebook and threatened to shout 'molest' during investigation, gets jail",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-imported-sausages-eggs-meat-sell-facebook-illegally-fined-jailed-shout-sfa-molest-2932481,"SINGAPORE: A woman illegally imported 36kg of sausages, meat and duck eggs from China, intending to sell them on Facebook.
When caught and asked to give a statement to a Singapore Food Agency (SFA) officer, she threatened to shout ""molest"", knowing it would injure his reputation.
Wang Shu, a 41-year-old Singaporean, was jailed for four weeks and fined S$5,000 on Monday (Sep 12). If she cannot pay the fine, she will have to serve two weeks and three days' jail in default.
She pleaded guilty to two counts under the Wholesome Meat and Fish Act, one count of holding out a threat of injury to the reputation of a public servant and one count under the Animals and Birds Act. A fifth charge was taken into consideration.
The court heard that Wang, also known as Vicky, was the director of Thanksgiving Group. She did not have a valid import licence to import food or related commodities.
On the morning of Jul 29, 2020, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers inspected a 40-footer container at Benoi Road after anomalies were detected.
The container arrived at Pasir Panjang Scanning Station from China the day before for import clearance. ICA officers detected different types of food in the container that were imported illegally, such as salted duck eggs and sausages.
The matter was referred to SFA for further investigations, and a total of 32.42kg of assorted meat products and 60 pieces or 3.6kg of salted duck eggs were found.
Wang had imported a total of 36kg of undeclared food items. These include 17.1kg of chicken and duck sausages, 500g of beef jerky and 60 salted duck eggs. The items were seized and three packets of pork and chicken sausages were infested with live maggots.
Investigations revealed that Wang had ordered all the items from China through the mobile application WeChat. She paid for the items through WeChat transfer to her China supplier.
Wang claimed that she did not know that she was not allowed to bring in such food from China and that this was her first time. She also claimed that she had brought the food in for her family's consumption, but it was revealed that she intended to sell it.
On Oct 6, 2020, she posted an advertisement on her personal Facebook page, intending to sell the pork and chicken sausages, and the beef jerky. She did not manage to do so as her consignment was detained by the SFA.
SFA OFFICERS VISIT WANG'S OFFICE
On Oct 29, 2020, SFA officers visited Wang's company in Pandan Loop to track her down as they had been unable to get hold of her via the phone or at her home.
One of the officers took a statement from Wang at her office, and she confirmed that she had brought in the implicated food items from China on her own accord. She claimed that they were not meant for sale by her company.
During the interview, incriminating communication was detected on Wang's mobile phone, and she began to become uncooperative. The SFA officer's colleagues left the room as they did not want to further agitate Wang, leaving Wang alone with the SFA officer.
He tried to calm Wang down, but she refused, so he ended the interview. However, while the officer was packing his belongings, Wang repeatedly asked him to hand over the partially recorded statement.
The officer refused, and Wang blocked the door, which was the only exit out of the room. She closed the door, locked it and held onto the doorknob. She then threatened to shout ""molest"" if the officer refused to give her the statement.
She knew that the accusation was false, and that shouting molest would injure the SFA officer's reputation as it would cause others to perceive that he had committed a sexual offence.
Because of this threat, the SFA officer gave Wang the partially recorded statement, which she tore before opening the door. The officer then left the company with his colleagues.
For illegally importing unlicensed meat products, she could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$50,000, or both.
For threatening injury to the reputation of a public servant, she could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.
CAUSE FOR CONCERN
In a joint media release, the police, SFA and ICA said the method of concealment in this case was a ""cause for concern"" as similar methods may be used by people to smuggle security items into Singapore.
""ICA will continue to conduct security checks on passengers, goods and vehicles so as to safeguard Singapore’s security,"" the release said.
""SFA will continue to safeguard food safety through our integrated food safety system, which includes strict import regulations and enforcement, as well as working closely with border control agencies to deter illegal import across our borders."""

"The Big Read: Pressures and temptations aplenty in sporting world, only a rare few can scale the peak and stay there","Already pursuing a path less travelled, sportspeople often have to make sacrifices in their personal lives. And the scrutiny is even worse for successful athletes, with the public quick to criticise their every move.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sports-athletes-singapore-joseph-schooling-amanda-lim-pressure-big-read-today-2930781,"SINGAPORE: In the months after former national swimmer Tao Li sprinted her way to a fifth-place finish in the 100m butterfly event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the expectations for her to deliver a medal at her next outing weighed on her mind.
She is still the first and only Singaporean female swimmer to make it into the finals of a swimming event at the Olympics thus far. And being only 18 at that time, there were hopes that she could achieve a medal in the 2012 London edition of the Games, when she had matured further as an athlete.
However, the 32-year-old told TODAY that the expectations and pressures of reaching the top became too much for her.  
“Once you reach the top, many things can distract you, and then you’re not focusing as much anymore, and you don’t want to take that much pain anymore, you don’t want to train that hard anymore, and then things will just change, immediately,"" she said.
“If over the course of one year, you’re still out of the top eight (swimmers) in the world, then that’s it. You won’t just get back to where you should be anymore.""
Sure enough, the years between the two Olympics were turbulent for her, with several coaching disruptions and a dip in form. 
Though she improved her pool timings before the 2012 Games, it could only guarantee her a 10th place finish in the 100m butterfly, which did not earn her a spot in the finals.
But Tao is not one to wallow in pity or rue the missed opportunity, as she knows better than anyone else that the world of elite sports is a ruthless, unforgiving one, where failures abound and success is rare. 
To her, what matters is that she tried her best. 
“Everyone’s perspective is different ... some fans will say that national swimmers should try to break the world record, but the swimmer might think that this is their best (effort) already,” she said.
“Both parties are not wrong - the swimmer represents themselves, but the public wants some more, and that’s fair.”
While Tao, who now runs her own swimming academy, has made peace with the ups and downs of her sporting career, the same pressures that she faced continue to hound the current crop of active sportsmen and sportswomen in Singapore.

One example is national rower Joan Poh, who had to contend with her own perceived failure during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, which was only held last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The 31-year-old had been an inspirational figure - both locally and internationally - during the sporting extravaganza, having juggled her training for the Olympics with her job as a nurse at the height of the pandemic. 
Poh said that given the upheaval caused by the pandemic, even qualifying and making it to the start line at the Olympics was “a feat on its own”. 
During the Games, she was placed 28 out of 32 competitors in the women’s single sculls competition - which left her feeling discouraged. 
“That is not winning, so I naturally came back and felt this sense that my outing to Tokyo was a failure,” she said.
It was only during the National Day Rally last year, when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong lauded Poh’s feat as embodying “the best of being Singaporean”, that she began to see her efforts in a different light. 
“When the Prime Minister called what I was doing the Singapore spirit, and something we can celebrate, it actually lifted my spirit.
“At this point, we don’t celebrate hard work, we work so hard, but then (it’s as if) when we don’t have a medal, we don’t deserve celebration,” Poh said.
The various pressures faced by athletes - both in and out of the sporting arena - have come to the fore once again following the recent case of drug use by Olympic champion Joseph Schooling and national swimmer Amanda Lim.  
The 27-year-old Schooling said in a public apology that he had given in to “a moment of weakness after going through a very tough period of my life”. The swimmer lost his father Colin, who had played a key role in his success, to cancer in November last year. 
In her own apology, Lim, 29, said that her swimming career has been filled with “many ups and downs” over the past 10 years, and that she has “always strived to be better in and out of the pool”.

Former national athlete and swim legend Ang Peng Siong told TODAY earlier that the two swimmers’ case shows “how vulnerable an athlete can be when faced with life’s challenges and adversity”.  
While some may argue that the pressures faced by Singapore’s national athletes are part and parcel of being in their chosen field, and it is up to them to find ways to cope with the stress, the fact remains that unlike most working adults, there are only so many ways a sportsperson can unwind and de-stress, veteran sportspeople told TODAY.

Other than the obvious no-nos such as the consumption of illegal substances, even simple pleasures like an alcoholic drink or a late-night supper may seem sacrilegious for these athletes, since they are also expected to keep their bodies in tip-top condition for their competitions. 
And the scrutiny is even worse for athletes who have already gained some success in their sport, said the veteran athletes. 
The pressure for them to stay on the straight and narrow, while continuing to produce sterling results, can often be too much for them to handle. 
Amid the intense scrutiny faced by Schooling and Lim on a personal level, a bigger question has also arisen from the saga: Is Singapore capable of ever producing a serial world beater who can bring home multiple world titles - given that the creme de la creme in the sporting fraternity often find it hard to stay at the top, with the pressure to perform in the next major games only mounting in the wake of their initial achievements?

For instance, Schooling himself and 2021 Badminton World Champion Loh Kean Yew - Singapore's two most high-profile sportsmen in recent years - have yet to match their career-defining achievements or even come close since then. 
THE PRESSURES ATHLETES FACE 
In the world of elite sports, the pressures that athletes face creep in long before they dance under the lights. And on the big day, the competition itself is a stressful experience - but the pressure is often due to extrinsic factors.
Former national sailor and Asian Games gold medallist Benedict Tan said the fact that many of these top athletes receive public funding only adds to the pressure on competition day. 
The Sport Excellence Scholarship (spexScholarship) by national sports governing body Sport Singapore, for example, provides financial support for high-performance athletes, as well as more opportunities to train and compete at major games, among other benefits. 
“If (the athlete) is very conscientious, he will be under more pressure, as he feels that he has to perform well to justify the public funding,” said Dr Tan, 54, who was also Singapore’s chef de mission to the Tokyo Olympics.
“If you feel that your funding level is not commensurate with your performance … then there’s that added ‘guilty’ feeling which makes you want to perform harder, want to try harder and, of course, that puts more pressure on you.” 
Agreeing, sports psychologists said that other than the pressure from public funding, there are also other expectations that ironically stem from the athletes' own support system  - such as family and the sporting associations, due to the amount of resources that they have poured into the athletes’ development. 
Dr Jay-Lee Nair, psychologist and practice owner of Mental Notes Singapore, said the underlying pressures that parents exert on their children comes at a young age. 
“(Athletes) recognise that their parents are putting in considerable investment financially, spiritually, and it becomes heavy for them … They feel like they have to achieve these goals to not let their parents down. 
“It is very common for young athletes to ineffectively process their performance, and they can fixate on it for a really long time, and it can really affect their performance going forward,” she added. 
Dr Jay-Lee said that for athletes who feel such pressure, it is important for them to find an outlet to talk about how they feel immediately after a competition.
She suggested that athletes should go through a “debriefing process” after a competition is over, where they talk to either their parents, psychologist or coach about what they did or did not do well as they competed, and how they can improve.
“This is so that they can develop a much more productive reflection process at the end of every single competition … and not just focusing on the errors they made.” 
And while most athletes who do not make it to the top of their sport remain relatively anonymous to the public, a whole new dimension of pressure sets in the moment they prove themselves on the world stage. 
Take it from Schooling’s former coach, Sergio Lopez. Speaking to TODAY from the United States where he lives and coaches, the former head coach of Singapore’s national swimming team said that with success in the sporting arena comes the loss in an athlete’s “sense of self”. 
“Winning an Olympic medal (means) you start being in the public image, and people start looking up to you as an example, and you lose ownership of who you are,” said the 54-year-old, who coached Schooling for five years leading up to his Olympic triumph, and again in 2020 to prepare for the Tokyo Games. 






      National swimmer Joseph Schooling and his then-coach Sergio Lopez at a training session in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Jun 20, 2016. (File photo: TODAY)
    






Lopez, who is presently the head coach of swimming and diving at Virginia Tech University, said that when Schooling first announced as a child that his dream was to beat American swim legend Michael Phelps, nobody other than his parents believed in him. 
“After the Olympics, everybody came out of the woods saying ‘I was part of Joseph’s journey’, and people only want to see the positives of life … and to have a perfect life, a perfect family … That’s a lot of pressure for anybody,” he said. 
Indeed, the public interest in Schooling’s life and fitness began to mount after his Olympic victory, with questions raised whenever he fell short in subsequent major games.
Even his physical appearance and weight became a talking point during the 2019 SEA Games.
Lopez said: “The biggest pressure is losing ownership of who you are, and having to live your life by everybody else’s expectations.”  
UNIQUELY SINGAPORE PRESSURES
National athletes also face ""Uniquely Singaporean"" pressures, like having to keep one eye on their longer-term careers - be it in or outside of their sport.
And this is the key difference between athletes here and some of their foreign counterparts, said former national diver Jonathan Chan, 25.
His last competition as a national athlete was at the 2021 SEA Games in Vietnam which was held in May this year due to the pandemic. 
“For a lot of other countries, (athletes’) priority will be sports, and then school is at the side. But for us, school is always the priority, and sports is more of a co-curricular activity,” said the 25-year-old Olympian, who also competed in the Tokyo Games.  
For instance, he said it is not uncommon for student athletes to have their training cut down when they do not perform well at school. 
Chan added that pursuing diving as a sport throughout his university years came at a huge opportunity cost. 
“In university, the time that I spend doing my sport, other people spend doing internships, and if you go out there and get interviewed for a job, the company will obviously pick the people with more experience in the job, they won’t say ‘wow, this guy went to major games’.
“They always say do well in sports and you can go far, but it’s not (always) true,” said Chan.

Agreeing, former national sportsperson Nicholas Fang, who has represented Singapore in both fencing and triathlon, said the juggling of different priorities is more evident here as opposed to other countries, where “national athletes typically train full-time and are supported by the state”. 
However, he said that this would help to “alleviate some pressure” as athletes can more easily see a path beyond the sport.
Fang said that he still felt the pressure from the sacrifices he was making to deliver on both the sports and career front. 
“I felt added pressure in that all the sacrifices made to balance the different priorities would seem to be for nought if I wasn’t able to deliver sporting results,” said the 47-year-old. 
The sport type also matters in determining the level of pressure one faces.
Ex-national badminton player Wong Shoon Keat said that for national badminton players, the sacrifices are often greater as compared to other sports, as most players play the game full-time. 
“There is no choice, if you don’t play full-time, we cannot compete against the countries around us - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand … because they are all playing full-time badminton,” said the 65-year-old, who won the nation’s first and only gold medal in badminton at the 1983 SEA Games held in Singapore. 
“It is a big sacrifice, because you have to put away your studies, you cannot go to work early to focus on the sport and play full-time.”
Wong added that for many players who do choose this path, it is difficult to have quality training, as many of their sparring or doubles partners will usually leave the sport to pursue their long-term careers.
Singapore’s culture of prioritising academics over sport is also harmful to young athletes, said sports psychologists.
Dr Jay-Lee from Mental Notes Singapore said a lot of parents are invested in their children's’ sporting excellence not because they want their kids to become full-time sportspeople, but because it can help them gain entry to their preferred schools. 
“Singapore is bursting with highly competitive developing athletes and their parents … They see success in sport at the youth level as a valuable addition to their resumes, either for top academic institutions, or as a vehicle for scholarship opportunities for university abroad,” she said. 
She added that one accelerator for this trend is the Direct School Admission programme, where students can gain entry into top educational institutes based on their sporting merit. 
This can have a negative outcome for children, who find themselves doing the sport for a very utilitarian purpose, other than pursuing it as a passion. 
“The child might not feel like they have a lot of autonomy … Maybe they feel like it’s something that is forced upon them and if they don’t enjoy the sport, then I think it can be really quite difficult and have a lot of negative consequences,” said Dr Jay-Lee.
Agreeing, Poh said that the culture in Singapore, being a financial hub, is based on what monetary value sport can bring to the individual, investors and commercial brands sponsoring the athlete. 
“The way we define success is not so much about the process or the journey, I think our pressure stems from not only wanting a gold medal … but it has to be a gold medal that can bring you money.
“Everything is tied to dollars and cents, and because of this kind of culture that we have, a lot of us don’t feel like we can do sports full-time … and instead need something to fall back on,” she said. 
She added that for athletes who have already achieved success on the world stage, their inability to replicate their success in future games does not mean that (their achievements) are not worth celebrating. 
“In sports what we want to encourage is not always the outcome, but more the spirit, the journey, the fight,” she said.

Despite the difficulties, former national athletes said that there are ways to balance expectations and put one's best foot forward, despite the sacrifices that have to be made to climb to - and remain at - the top. 
Dr Tan said: “Is it constructive to tell myself that I am making a huge sacrifice and that I’m so pitiful?” 
“I know that my life is different from others but I don’t pity myself … I see it the other way round, that I have a unique life, that very few people can get to live,” he added.
He also agreed with Poh that the public needs to have a deeper appreciation of the athletes' hard work and sacrifices, rather than solely the results they achieve.
However, the athletes themselves cannot be contented when they fall short, but should always be hungry to achieve better results. After all, many of them are backed by public funds and are naturally expected to deliver.  
""The psychology behind winning and staying at the top and the satisfaction (in your effort) are two different things,"" said Dr Tan. ""I'm not saying that if you win once, and you're a one-hit wonder, you should be satisfied with yourself."" 
Agreeing, former Singapore sprint king C Kunalan said being a national athlete entails putting aside many other opportunities, be it to progress in their careers, or in relationships, and this is something that has to be accepted.
“Every sportsman and woman who is hoping to achieve the highest level must realise that they need to make sacrifices,” said the 79-year-old. 
“But for some it is not a sacrifice, but it is what they want and they feel happy doing this … They are passionate.” 
IS THERE MORE PRESSURE NOW THAN BEFORE? 
According to former national athletes, the pressures that elite sportsmen and sportswomen face have only increased over the years.
Kunalan said that the support that the athletes receive now is far greater than what he used to get, when he was competing in athletics in the 1960s and 1970s. 
National athletes were granted two weeks of paid leave before any major games, such as the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, as the SEA Games was known then, said the former school teacher. 
During that period of intensive training, they would sometimes get free meals that came from public donations. 
“A lot of the pressure would have been from the feeling that we had been given time off from work,” Kunalan said. 
This pales in comparison to the larger amount of resources granted to national athletes now, under programmes such as the spexScholarship. 
“I think definitely there will be more pressure on the current athletes, especially those at the highest level,” Kunalan said.

Dr Tan said that social media is also playing an increasingly bigger role in athletes’ lives.
“The athlete cannot block social media off totally, because that’s how he builds his fanbase … So they cannot run away, they have to engage social media because that’s part of being an athlete.”
He added that in general, “sponsorship stakes” are also higher now, which will also add more pressure to the athletes. 
At the same time, due to the increased commercialisation of sports, there are generally more competitions and events now as sponsors seek to “pack the calendar”. 
This arrangement may suit larger countries fine, as they have a larger group of world-class athletes who can take turns to compete in various competitions.
However, for Singapore, there are only a few athletes who are able to compete at the highest level, and so they have no choice but to go for most of these competitions to fly the nation’s flag. 
Wong, who now is a badminton coach at the schools’ level, said this is the case for world champion Loh. 
The 25-year-old has to go for back-to-back badminton tournaments “because we don’t have any players who can take over his place, while other countries have standby good players"".
“So we always depend on Kean Yew … and he becomes very fatigued and very tired,” Wong said. 
MANAGING TEMPTATIONS WELL
Veteran athletes said that no matter what the era, there's always the proverbial forbidden fruit somewhere to tempt or distract sportsmen and sportswomen from performing well. 
These can range from gambling, alcohol and even drugs. Even innocuous deeds to the common man, like playing computer games, spending late nights with friends or a visit to a fast-food restaurant, can be seen as taboo.
Dr Tan said he does not think there are more temptations now, in the form of vices or distractions, than there were in the past; only their nature has changed. 
During his youth, the “distraction” was video games.
While too many such distractions are bad, having no distractions is also not good for an athlete.

Dr Tan said that though he had abstained from playing any video games to focus on his training, his father was the one who actively encouraged him to play them. 
“My father felt that I was so weird as a teenager who was not interested in computer games, that he forced me to play,” he said. “You want some normality … you cannot be totally ignorant.” 
He added that he had applied this philosophy to his later years in the sport. 
For instance, while he was training as a national athlete, he still went out with his friends for drinking sessions - except he would make compromises such as not consume any alcohol. 
“When I don’t drink, my body still stays clean and optimal, but at the same time, I also want to gain more social skills,” he said. “While learning to be a better sailor, I also need to learn to be a better person, it’s not contradictory.”
However, sport psychologists said these compromises and ways of dealing with stress have to happen from a young age. 
Chief sport and performance psychologist at SportPsych Consulting Edgar Tham said that to keep athletes away from dealing with their stress through unhealthy means, there needs to be a “proactive approach”.  
With younger athletes, Mr Tham will often do a “mental screening” on them, such as asking them what their mental state is, and what stressors they face.
Should the athlete indicate any issues or show signs of stress, then the athletes will be supported by psychologists. 
“The proactive approach is what (sporting bodies) don’t do enough, it’s like a ticking time bomb, once the stress goes beyond a certain level, athletes may take desperate measures to deal with it in their own way,” he said. 
However, it is only human to err, and ultimately elite sportspeople cannot be expected to stay away from all of life’s temptations during the years they spend training and competing. 
As Fang, the former national triathlete, put it, these sportspeople are in a high-pressure environment, and have fewer outlets than most to de-stress. 
“For normal people, sporting activities can be a relief from the daily grind, but elite athletes don’t have this avenue, which might explain why they seek other ways to blow off steam and release stress,” he said. 
For ex-national swimmer Tao, a common way for her to relieve the pressure of competition was to engage in retail therapy, and on rare occasions, she would go to a nightclub. 
“Different people will have different ways to relieve their pressure … I think once or twice a year should be okay,” she said. “But when I was competing, I didn't smoke, and I didn't drink alcohol at all.” 
Ultimately, said Schooling’s former coach Lopez, it is unrealistic to expect athletes to not want to do the things that normal people do. 
Lopez, who won the bronze medal in the 1988 Olympics, returned to his country a hero, having been the first person born and raised in Spain to win an Olympic medal in swimming. 
He went to a nightclub to celebrate the achievement, only to have some members of the public come up to him and criticise him for consuming alcohol. 
“I’m not excusing any of that, but I think what people need to understand is that people are people and they go through a lot of things, and they feel very lonely and they make decisions that they shouldn’t.” 
However, the sportspeople interviewed all agreed that a line has to be drawn with illegal substances, such as recreational or performance-enhancing drugs.
When athletes make such grave mistakes, they have to own up to them, because after all, they are still in the public eye and a role model to many. 
“When you break the law, you have to be accountable, and you have to be responsible and you have to be honest with the mistakes that you make,” said Lopez. 
CAN SINGAPORE PRODUCE SERIAL WORLD-BEATERS? 
While the world celebrates serial winners - Roger Federer in tennis, Michael Phelps in swimming, Lionel Messi in football, and a select group of others who have gained sporting immortality - can we expect Singapore itself to produce more than one-hit wonders?
The nation has occasionally produced world beaters, such as Schooling, who went on to beat his idol Phelps en route to a gold medal in the 2016 Olympics, and badminton player Low, who outplayed then world number one Viktor Axelsen to clinch the world championship title last year.
However, such feats have yet to be repeated on the same scale for either of the two athletes, which begs the question: Is it fair for Singaporeans to expect a repeat of world-beating performances from our athletes?
The answer, according to veteran athletes, is “no”. 
“People think that just because you are an Olympic champion, that you have to be an Olympic champion the next time,” said Lopez. “I’m sorry, but if it was that easy, everybody would do it.” 






      The nation has occasionally produced world beaters, such as Joseph Schooling, who went on to beat his idol Phelps en route to a gold medal in the 2016 Olympics, and badminton player Low Kean Yew, who outplayed then world number one Viktor Axelsen to clinch the world championship title last year.

Explaining the difficulty behind such an endeavour, Dr Tan said there is a big difference between the time when an athlete is chasing for the top spot, and when he has reached there and is trying to maintain his dominance.  
“It’s not easy to stay at world number one, because … it’s easier to be the one chasing,” he said. “Once you’re at the top and you’re the one being chased, your training strategy will have to change.” 
Using a business analogy, Dr Tan pointed out that growing a small company often requires a very different set of skills from keeping a big company steady. 
“The skills to stay at the top are much more complex … Most of the time, you practise chasing to reach the top, but how many get to practise staying at the top?” 
So what makes serial world beaters tick? According to American science magazine Popular Science, the key difference lies in these athletes’ mental training and ability to stay focused. 
For instance, these top athletes often train with distractions. When golf legend Tiger Woods was young, for example, his father would jingle keys or drop coins when he was in the middle of his golf swing. 
For Phelps, American business news channel CNBC reported that the 23-time Olympic gold medallist would put his goals down on paper and frequently look them over, especially after a tough day. 
He even has goals up to 20 years into the future jotted down, so that it helps him stay focused. 
And according to British daily the Guardian, tennis legend Federer’s dominance on the court in a career spanning more than 20 years is due in part to his willingness to learn new playing styles and improve on his ground strokes constantly, despite already winning virtually every accolade in the sport.
Ultimately, it all boils down to the nation’s sporting culture, said Schooling’s former coach Lopez, echoing the sentiment expressed by other athletes interviewed. 
He gave the example of when he was coaching swimming in Singapore between 2015 and 2016. While he saw many children with the potential to excel in the pool, they were never pushed by their parents to give their all to the sport. 
“Kids didn’t show up to practise … because they had to study,” he said. “Instead of their parents telling them to come up to Coach Sergio to set up a plan, they would tell them (the kids) that they don’t have to come to practise.”
He added that Schooling’s path to success was in contrast to what he had observed in most young swimmers here. 
A confluence of factors - Schooling having the potential to be a world champion, him daring to dream of beating Phelps one day, and most crucially, his parents believing fully in his dreams - was what led to an unlikely Olympic gold for Singapore, said Lopez. 
Some psychologists and sportspeople pointed out despite the well-known constraints that Singaporean elite sportspeople have to grapple with, the pressures exerted on them - including in the form of public expectations - can actually spur them to even greater heights. 
""It is up to an athlete, how he manages the pressure. If he manages it in a positive way, it becomes a good pressure that spurs him to work even harder,"" he said. 
For example, Dr Tan said that even when he fared well in sailing regionally, he would often put additional pressure on himself to work harder, keeping in mind the fact that his performances still paled in comparison to the best the world had to offer. 
""I would tell myself that I would have to work harder to justify my slot at the World Championships,"" he said. ""That's what a conscientious person would do, he turns the pressure into something positive."" 
Whatever the future holds for Singapore’s elite sportspeople, Lopez felt that an Olympian like Schooling “doesn’t need to win another Olympic medal to be somebody that can change the country, because he has already changed it”.
“He has a lot of experience from living abroad, racing, and he can share that with the Singaporean youth, and it’s invaluable, you cannot pay for that with money.”
“So it’s really up to you guys, how you want to appreciate your own.”

"PCF aims to add about 2,500 pre-school places by end-2023",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pcf-aims-add-about-2500-pre-school-places-end-2023-2931676,"SINGAPORE: PAP Community Foundation (PCF) will aim to add about 2,500 more pre-school places by the end of next year, it said on Sunday (Sep 11).
PCF, a charitable foundation, provides pre-school services through PCF Sparkletots, which is the largest pre-school operator in Singapore. It has about 360 pre-schools that cater to more than 40,000 children.
In addition to the new spaces, PCF said more will be done to advance inclusive practices at PCF pre-schools to ensure children receive the same learning opportunities.
“By early 2023, 260 pre-schools will also be equipped with an inclusion coordinator among existing staff who will be trained to identify children with potential developmental needs and connect teachers and parents to the Inclusive Education Team to receive targeted assistance,” it said in a media release.
The foundation announced the move on Sunday during its Family Day event, which was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo, and Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment and Transport Amy Khor.

PCF’s Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths, Invention and Entrepreneurship Approach (STEMIE) programme will also be rolled out to all 320 centres that offer kindergarten services by 2024, benefiting close to 50,000 children. It is currently available to up to 13,500 children.
“The STEMIE programme challenges preschoolers to create practical solutions for real-world problems, instilling resilience and cultivating essential skills in critical thinking and problem-solving,” said PCF.
PCF’s chief executive officer Victor Bay said: “PCF remains dedicated to providing access to affordable and quality education for every child and we take pride in our continued efforts to create more inclusive preschools and to equip our children with essential skills for the future.
“We received great feedback from parents and children alike for our STEMIE programme that challenges little ones to be innovative, resilient and entrepreneurial, and we are excited to expand the programme to more centres.
“We also believe that every child deserves a good start with quality preschool education, despite their diverse learning abilities. Our efforts to advance inclusive practices in our preschools will go a long way to ensure that no child gets left behind.”
Earlier this year, it was announced that Punggol would get seven new pre-schools as parents struggled to secure childcare places.
The Early Childhood Development Agency said the new pre-schools would be developed by the end of the year and will provide an additional 220 infant care places and 1,700 childcare places.





ENHANCING CARE FOR SENIORS
PCF also operates senior care centres through PCF Sparkle Care.
The foundation plans to expand its eldercare facilities in the next few years. The development of an eighth PCF Sparkle Care centre will start in 2024, and it aims to set up more senior care centres in the next five years.
This is in line with the Ministry of Health's (MOH) target to expand eldercare services to meet the needs of an ageing population, said PCF.
The seven senior care centres currently serve 440 people in day care services and 430 people who are undergoing rehabilitation therapy.
""PCF also aims to set up eldercare centre services in selected senior care centres to expand its scope of services for the elderly. These eldercare centre services include active ageing programmes, befriending programmes, and referral services,"" it added."
More buskers performing in heartlands with new booking platform,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/buskers-heartlands-neighbourhoods-booking-system-2926751,"SINGAPORE: It’s supper time at Changi Village Hawker Centre on the last night before the food centre is closed three months for renovation.
A table of middle-aged men are drinking beer and singing along to The ETC as they belt out oldies, many on request by this group of tipsy fans. 
The men ask for English songs like Beautiful Sunday, as well as songs in Hokkien and Cantonese. It's not long before they get up and start dancing, faces red, eyes bleary – clearly enjoying their last hurrah before they have to find somewhere else to hang out on weekend nights.
Buskers are now a common sight again in Orchard and central areas – for instance, the crowds that gathered outside The Cathay for busker Jeff Ng. But they have also made their comeback in heartland areas.
The ETC, a twosome comprising Tristan Ong and Joey Wee, are a fixture at AMK Hub but came to Changi Village to bid farewell to the hawker centre. Their performance was well-received by the regulars who were sad that the hawker centre will be closed for a while.

Mr Ong, 46, said that he has tried performing in Orchard but prefers the “heartland vibe”.
He admitted that when he first started his music career, he did not think of busking professionally, and he thought only tissue sellers sang at MRT stations.
“Eventually, slowly, we realised that our songs and maybe our vibe is more suitable for the heartlands,” he said.
People in the heartlands tend to show more appreciation and stopped more often to listen,  he said, while people in central areas are often in a hurry.
Post-pandemic, buskers have more choices where to perform as the National Arts Council (NAC) has launched a booking portal for buskers. While this was piloted during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has now come fully online with the resumption of busking activities.
Before, each busker got five locations that they can busk at, and there wasn’t a way to book. There was always a possibility that someone else would get there before they did.
Busker Norman Mohd Yusof, who has been busking for 10 years, has had this experience. He went to check the venue and it was available, but after he parked his car and went to get his instrument, someone came and started busking in the spot in the five to 10 minutes that he was gone.
“With this (e-booking) system, that should not happen,“ he said. “To me, it’s very fair because it allows you to be sure before you go to the location, unlike before.”
With the new booking system, he and his partner Rahmat Daros can be sure they have a slot when they book one online.

Thank you notes, flowers, smiles: What drives Singapore's young buskers to play their hearts out













The regulars at Woodlands and Admiralty, who busk under the moniker Norm and Matt, also said that they prefer heartland audiences who will sit and listen, rather than rush by.
For example, they like busking at a restaurant at Woodlands Waterfront where they will sing birthday songs for anyone celebrating their birthday there. On Aug 9, when they sing National Day songs, people sing along, said the 57-year-old.
“The ambience is nice as it’s near the sea … and if you look behind, it’s actually Johor Bahru … the scenery is nice, so we come in, bring in the music, so I think they enjoy it,” he said.
“They tend to sit longer than usual, have their beer and food … it’s almost like we’re a resident band there.”
With the new booking system, they also want to try other areas that they’ve not busked at before.
However, it does not mean they will always get the places they want as some popular spots are quickly snapped up. For busking spots that are hot property, there is a balloting system. This includes spots along Orchard Road, at Paya Lebar Square and in Ang Mo Kio.
GREATER VARIETY OF ACTS
There are about 300 buskers registered with the NAC, and they need to audition to get a busking licence. In the past, the five locations each busker was allotted would be printed on their busking cards.
With the e-booking service, they can choose from more than 70 locations across Singapore.
“There's more surety of their locations and their busking slots,” said Ms Koh Jau Chern, assistant director for access and participation at NAC.
In the past, without a booking system, some buskers hog a location for the entire day, she added. 
The change came after feedback from buskers about their challenges, Ms Koh said. The new booking platform helps buskers, who are already subject to the whims of the weather, plan ahead.
Since the new system was launched, there has been a greater variety of acts at popular, high-traffic locations, according to the NAC. For example, 25 buskers performed at AMK Hub in August, with just about 7 per cent of the slots not used.

At a night out at Kampung Admiralty, buskers Norm and Matt serenade residents with English and Malay ballads. Some walk past with barely a glance, others stay for a while to enjoy the music.
Ms Ramlah Awang, who is sitting at the town square with her husband, stops to listen. She says buskers make the area more lively and she’s glad they’re there.
She thinks it would be nice if there can be a schedule of what and when the performances are, as she only finds out that there’s something on if she passes by or hears about it from her sister.
“I will come down, and I can take a photo (of the schedule) and text my friends so more will come,” she said."
Progress made in women’s development but more can be done to tackle gender gaps: Lawrence Wong,"Speaking at the annual conference for the People’s Action Party (PAP) Women’s Wing, the Deputy Prime Minister pointed to gender stereotypes as one major challenge.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-womens-development-gender-gap-lawrence-wong-2930906,"SINGAPORE: While Singapore has achieved progress in women’s development, “persistent and insidious” gender gaps still exist in society and there remains “much scope for improvement”, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Saturday (Sep 10).
Noting that women now get equal education opportunities as men and are taking up leadership roles in both the public and private sectors, he said: “We have made progress and we should be proud of the progress we have made, but we should also recognise that the situation is not perfect.”
Speaking at the annual conference for the People’s Action Party (PAP) Women’s Wing, Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, pointed to gender stereotypes as one major challenge.
“There are, of course, differences between men and women. It’s deeply rooted in human nature and human physiology, and we see these differences expressed in almost every area of life,” he said.
“These differences should be affirmed and celebrated … But sometimes, the differences can lead to unhelpful stereotypes and labels, especially when they are reinforced by cultural and popular media.”
He noted how stereotypes entrench certain mindsets about women and how they are judged, such as women being seen as less inclined to take risks and hence not being able to be effective leaders. They also risk forming self-fulfilling prophecies that inhibit and dissuade women from making their voices heard or making career choices they are entitled to.
Beyond work, the stereotype of women being inherently more nurturing than men due to maternal instincts “can be unhelpful if taken to an extreme”, Mr Wong added.
“Because the man will say ‘There you go, you’re so good at it. So in the interest of division of labor, why not you spend more time caring for the children and families, while I focus on my career?’
“That's completely unhelpful because … caregiving roles should not be a domain only for women. Men can and must do our part too,” he said at the conference attended by the ruling party’s Members of Parliament, representatives of the social service sector and activists.

IN FOCUS: Beyond diversity quotas and anti-discrimination laws, can Singapore embrace gender equality at the workplace?













Mr Wong also brought up the risk of the Internet and social media reinforcing gender stereotypes. 
For example, young girls now are at risk of being pressurised to look a certain way in order to get more likes on social media. Meanwhile, sexualised images of women online can easily influence the attitudes and mindsets of young boys.
“Social media turbocharges these stereotypes and we know that these stereotypes are often the precursor to more extreme sexist attitudes, even hate speech or worse - bullying, harassment, and even sexual abuse and violence,” he said.
That is why Singapore must continue to step up efforts in this area, be it education in school against stereotypes, safeguards for women against violence, online harm and discrimination at the workplace, to improving the broader infrastructure and ecosystem for childcare and senior care.
Employers must also do their part to provide more flexible work arrangements, the minister said.
“Ultimately, we must try to shape more progressive family norms to encourage more shared parental responsibilities and a more balanced sharing of family caregiving responsibilities.
“And if we can do all that, then I’m sure we can see more women thrive, excel and advance in leadership roles, in both the public and private sectors, and they will do so on their own merit, not through some special scheme or treatment because you do not need them.”
All this means that Singapore’s work of advancing women’s development is “never finished”. 
“We must keep at it and we must continue to push the agenda along,” said Mr Wong. “Because the bottom line is that Singapore women are equally capable as men and we will give you equal opportunities to prove yourself and reach your fullest potential.”
Mr Wong pointed to the Forward Singapore initiative – launched in June by the ruling party’s fourth-generation or 4G leadership team – as one way of doing so. 
“Through this exercise, we hope we can come together to imagine the kind of society we want for our children and our grandchildren. A society where men and women can stand as equals, where we recognise the intrinsic value of women in Singapore, and where every citizen is empowered to fulfill their aspirations and dreams.”
Following his speech, Mr Wong joined Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo and Member of Parliament Carrie Tan (PAP-Nee Soon) in a dialogue session, where they discussed issues such as paternity leave and women in leadership roles.

Speaking to reporters after the conference, Mrs Teo echoed that gender stereotypes remain an obstacle in achieving a fairer and more inclusive society, with one being norms and expectations for women to be primary caregivers.
“Although this has changed a great deal in Singapore where we see many more men … stepping up to be part of caregiving in their families, I think this is the progress but you can always do more to encourage this to continue.”
Earlier in her opening speech, Mrs Teo, who chairs the PAP Women’s Wing, described caregiving as “both hard work and ‘heart’ work”.
“Although much has been done, women’s development really is a journey without end. A big part of our effort must be focused on our caregivers,” she added.
At the moment, the Government helps in various ways, such as enhancing access to affordable and quality childcare and expanding grants to relieve the financial strain of caregivers.
“But we all know how demanding caregiving is and how much more a community of support is needed. This is why we talk about growing our ‘Circles of Care’,"" the minister said, while citing efforts by the ruling party such as organising and delivering care services, and advocating for caregivers and women."
"Career planning, mental health among youths' concerns over entering workforce","These concerns were shared by about 70 students during a dialogue organised by NTUC, as part of the NTUC Youth Taskforce.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntuc-youth-taskforce-varsity-voices-dialogue-youths-career-financial-mental-wellbeing-concerns-2930726,"SINGAPORE: Career planning, financial adequacy and mental well-being were the top three main concerns that youths face before they enter the workforce.
This was the result of a poll conducted prior to the closed-door Varsity Voices Dialogue organised by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) on Friday (Sep 9).
The dialogue was attended by NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng, who addressed about 70 students from different Institutes of Higher Learning, as well as secondary schools.
The event is part of the NTUC Youth Taskforce, which was launched in July this year to better understand the work-life aspirations of youths.
The year-long exercise aims to engage 10,000 youths aged between 18 and 25 to find out more about their goals and concerns. It has since reached more than 1,000 individuals and plans to hold sessions with polytechnics in October.

The From School to Work: Future-Readiness of Singaporean Youths dialogue on Friday focused on how youths can be prepared to transition from being students to working professionals. 
It was held in partnership with Varsity Voices, an inter-university network that holds regular dialogues covering ""topics which matter most to youths"", said NTUC in a media release on Saturday.
The network includes the NUS Students’ Political Association, NTU Current Affairs Society and SMU Apolitical Society.
""This is amidst the changing economic backdrop, driving forces such as sustainable development, digitalisation, and growing demands for caregiving and flexible work arrangements that are changing the world of work,"" NTUC added.
Participants shared that they were particularly concerned about ensuring employability in the job market, what skills would be attractive to employers in the near future and how to be better prepared before entering the workforce.
The concerns brought up by students during the dialogue aligned with findings from studies conducted by NTUC and Young NTUC earlier this year, it said. These findings were also used as a basis to form the task force.
A separate study by Young NTUC in February found that young people find job and internship opportunities, skills workshops and career mentoring to be most useful among career-related programmes. The study involved 1,500 respondents aged between 18 and 35.
“Since the launch of the NTUC Youth Taskforce, we have engaged more than 1,000 youths between 18 and 25 years old so far and are looking forward to meeting many more youths out there who will have differing views,"" said NTUC Assistant Secretary-General Desmond Choo, who chairs the Youth Taskforce.
""It is encouraging to see this meaningful discourse being carried out, and as NTUC wants to be the guiding buddy in their work-life journeys, such partnerships are an important pillar to build our future workforce and create a desired workplace.”
As part of NTUC Youth Taskforce's engagements in September, the Youth Hub roving exhibition will be set up at ITE College Central from Sep 14 to Sep 15. It will then move to the Singapore Institute of Management Global Education from Sep 29 to Sep 30.
The Youth Hub consists of a series of interactive elements to provide youths with useful career advice and tips, said NTUC, adding that these include learning about their employment rights as well as career profiling tests.
Focus group discussions will also be held throughout this month at various locations."
SOS launches 24-hour WhatsApp service to help people in distress,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/suicide-whatsapp-service-caretext-samaritans-singapore-help-2929241,"SINGAPORE: Suicide is the leading cause of death for young people aged between 10 and 29 in Singapore. Last year, 378 people took their own lives – nearly a third were in that age group.
This is one of the reasons the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) has set up a 24-hour WhatsApp service to help those in distress.
People who need help can text 9151 1767 for support via CareText, or call 1767 to reach the hotline.
Officially launched on Saturday (Sep 10), the service, called CareText, is manned by SOS’ trained volunteers and staff.
First piloted in July 2020 on limited hours, it widened its coverage to run 24/7 in January this year for a trial, before the official launch.
During a survey in 2020, some youths told SOS that there was a lack of suitable and trusted avenues for them to turn to, said Mr Phua Chun Yat, SOS’ chief operating officer.
“We thought (texting) would be a good platform to reach out to youths and try to reduce the barriers of help seeking, especially at a time where I think there was a lot of uncertainty, people were starting to stay at home because of the pandemic,” he explained.
Last month, SOS answered almost 1,800 chats – nearly triple the number of chats received in August 2021. During the trial, the non-profit organisation found that about 82 per cent of the people who messaged were aged 29 and below.
HOW IT WORKS
Those using CareText remain anonymous throughout the text conversation and the volunteer or staff member cannot see the phone numbers.
When a person accesses CareText, they will be first asked basic questions, such as gender, age group and their distress level.
“Those questions … help us kind of know who we are talking to,” explained Mr John Lam, senior manager of crisis support at SOS.
“After that, they are engaged by our trained volunteers and staff. We are using the same method that we are using for the hotline, but adapted for texting. 
“Our volunteers practise active listening. It’s important we listen to their problems – the pain points. 
“We do accept there are suicide risks, and we do ask them if they are contemplating suicide. The conversation can go as long as they want. The objective is to de-escalate the crisis they are facing at that point in time.”
There are currently about 100 CareText volunteers and all of them have undergone about six months of training.
These volunteers have to learn to understand each texter, reflect back on what they say and the emotions they are going through.
Texts come in throughout the day and peak from 4pm to 2am, Mr Lam said. Usually text chats last longer than phone calls, a service which SOS provides via a suicide prevention hotline. Some text correspondence can go on for more than an hour.

Sometimes, a person texting may express suicidal tendencies. When that happens, the volunteer will look to work with the person to keep them safe.
“We tell the person, ‘I want to work with you to keep you safe’ … For example, if they are outside, the safety plan could be that they agree to go home because it is less (risky),” explained Mr Lam.
“Is there someone they can call now to stay with them and keep them safe – their parents or friends? In that case, then the plan is to find someone to help keep them safe.
“That’s where the training of volunteers is important, because essentially, there is no one way to de-escalate. It is very much working with the person to come to a place where I can de-escalate their crisis and keep them safe for the day.”
If the risk is “very immediate”, the volunteer will work with the texter to work out immediate solutions, such as contacting family or emergency services, said Mr Phua. Should they need further help, SOS will follow up with them and link them up with counsellors.
This is when volunteers or staff members will ask for the texter’s number if they need to call the texter.
KEY ISSUES
Most texters who contact SOS are below 29 years old. 
More than 80 per cent of SOS’ trained CareText volunteers are also in this age group. 
Among the key issues raised in the text conversations include relationship problems, issues at school or problems at home.
Some problems may have “intensified” as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Mr Phua.
“Generally our mental health and stability have gone down, mental health issues have gone up because of the other stresses that come with the pandemic,” he added.
“Even though we are primarily focusing on suicide, if (people) are facing distress for various issues, they can text us. Our goal is really to help them reduce the level of distress … so they are able to find certain stability.""

One of the difficulties is overcoming the stigma of asking for help. The question is how SOS can reduce the barriers to seeking help, he explained.
“One of the good things about COVID-19 was that it helped a lot of people to be vulnerable about what they have gone through,” said Mr Phua.
“And I think that has kind of reduced certain notions of stigma … I think we are going in the right direction in terms of that.”
The Samaritans are looking to recruit more volunteers to help. All volunteers will go through six months of training, including classroom-based training and practice in a simulated environment.
They will also be supervised during the live chats with people. These supervisors have access to all chats and can step in should volunteers need help.
SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said: “We hope that this consistency, along with its round-the-clock availability, will make it more accessible for individuals in distress to reach out for support.”

IN FOCUS: They were 'the place to be' for generations of shoppers. But what lies ahead for department stores?,"For decades, department stores were “the place to be” and held special memories for generations of shoppers. But now, some are saying it may be checkout time. CNA takes a look at the changing fortunes of department stores in Singapore.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/department-stores-og-robinsons-yaohan-metro-isetan-2922831,"SINGAPORE: It was not a big space, but Daniel Wang never ran out of things to see at the toy section of Isetan in Parkway Parade shopping mall.
Action figures from his favourite cartoons - from Transformers, G.I. Joe to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - lined the shelves in the department store. Nearby, a small TV set showed the latest toy commercials and, sometimes, cartoons.
The weekend trip to the mall with his family was “the highlight of the week” for Mr Wang when he was growing up in the 1980s. In particular, the free time to roam about with his brother in the toy section of the department store was the icing on the cake.
“Just being there in the store, you get to look at all the toys,” he reminisced. “It was like going to a candy store … and you drool at all the things you want but can’t afford.”
The “candy store” turned into “Disneyland” one day in June 1989 when Michelangelo, one of the four superpowered reptilian heroes from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Robocop, a cyborg police officer from the hit 1980s movie franchise, made an appearance.
The event, which Mr Wang found out through a newspaper advertisement, lasted for just half an hour but for the exhilarated fans in attendance, it was a memory for a lifetime.
“Even though Michelangelo was someone in a suit, it didn’t feel that way at all. As a kid, I was just blown away,” he recalled.
“It’s like being in Disneyland where you meet the characters and you feel so fascinated that even by the time they are gone, you’re still covered in their stardust. Needless to say, that was one of the best days of my life.”
Not wanting to miss any special moments, Mr Wang took many photos that day with his camera. But in the end, he still missed out on one.
“Up to this day, I still regret that I wasn’t in any of these photos.”
With all these memories, Mr Wang, now in his 40s, would continue to drop by the toy section whenever he visited Parkway Parade. So when it was announced that the store would be shut in March, he was “devastated”.
“Even though I don’t frequent the mall as often in recent years because of online shopping and so on, the attachment is still there. That was the place that gave me the magic moment but now, I can no longer go back.”

Prior to closing its Parkway Parade branch, Isetan – a Japanese department store that first set up shop in Singapore in the 1970s – shut down another outlet in Westgate in 2019.
But it is not just Isetan that has been shuttering stores.
Homegrown operator Metro closed its six-storey flagship store at The Centrepoint in 2019. This was followed by the demise of Robinsons, one of Singapore’s oldest department stores, in 2020.
More recently, OG, another household name, said it will pull down the shutters at its Orchard Point outlet after an 18-year run at the location.
Known for their multi-storey outlets and products that span every imaginable category, department stores used to be seen by many as exciting places where people could find everything from pots and pans to dresses with matching shoes. 
But after having served generations, the fortunes of department stores are dwindling amid changing needs and habits.
Some operators told CNA they are determined to evolve alongside consumers, with changes already afoot. But with shoppers increasingly turning online for their retail needs and having less interest to spend hours in sprawling shops, what lies ahead for these once-loved retail titans?
“THE PLACE TO BE”
There was a time when department stores were pulling in the crowds and deemed “the place to be” for both locals and tourists.
The 1957 edition of the “Guide to Singapore and Spotlight on Malaya” – a guidebook by advertising and publishing agency Papineau Studios – recommended Robinsons, John Little and Whiteaway’s for their variety of imported goods, as well as other services offered under one roof in a luxurious ambience.
Robinsons, whose three-storey outlet at bustling Raffles Place was “tastefully decorated”, was the place for the likes of “exquisite” French perfumes and women’s wear from famous fashion houses in England and America.
Its toys department was “a joy to behold at Christmas”, the book said, alongside amenities like a beauty salon and a “first-class” restaurant. The air-conditioning – a rarity in the 1950s – also earned a mention for making shopping a pleasure.
John Little, located across the street, stood out for its floral department which was “always bright with orchids and tastefully arranged floral baskets”. A few blocks away along Battery Road stood Whiteaway’s – an upmarket department store that was the only place in town for perfumes and jewellery by French luxury brand Christian Dior.
Beyond Raffles Place, Orchard Road welcomed its first department store in 1958 when businessman Tang Choon Keng moved his thriving business from River Valley Road to the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road.
The five-storey C.K. Tang building, inspired by the Imperial Palace in Beijing and with a distinctive pagoda-like roof with green tiles, quickly became a landmark in the area.

The following decades saw the entry of even more foreign and local department stores, such as Japan’s Yaohan – still remembered by many for its iconic green and white logo, and red bean buns – and Oriental Emporium.
The latter, founded by brothers Lim Tow Seng and Lim Tow Yong in 1961, sold Chinese products at affordable prices and found huge success among ordinary Singaporeans. At its peak, the chain had almost 20 stores across the island before being brought down by the economic recession in the 1980s.
Housewife Penny Lim, 64, has fond memories of Oriental Emporium – a place she frequented with friends during her teenage years.
“There were not many shopping centres during the 1970s and 1980s, that's why everyone went to department stores and one of the most popular ones was Emporium. It was always crowded,” she said in Mandarin.
“If my friends and I were going out, it would definitely be Emporium. It had everything we want – shoes, bags, clothes – and they were affordable. It was like, the place to be.”
Another department store that held a special place among Singaporeans that CNA spoke to was Robinsons' outlet at The Centrepoint, which opened its doors in 1983.
For Adeline Sim, this was where her mother brought her for annual “excursions”  before Chinese New Year.
“Robinsons was my mother's favourite place for bedsheets and other home necessities. But in the past, we don't shop as often, especially at Orchard Road. So I was always very excited when my mum brought me along,” said the 39-year-old.
Likewise for Lim Xiu Ru, visits to the store served as family bonding time while growing up. These trips were made even more special during festive occasions.
“My parents would bring me to Robinsons at Centrepoint ... (and) their favourite photo is of me (sitting) at the ledge outside Robinsons,” said Ms Lim, who is a lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic’s business school. “Some of my memories were tied to Christmas light-ups along Orchard Road.”
Another allure of shopping at department stores back in the day was the “exciting” sales events, others said, citing steep discounts offered regularly.
“In the past, everything would be placed out in the open. You could touch, pick them up and look. But because there were many people, you had to be fast to get what you wanted and when you got it, it can be very satisfying,” said Ms Lim, the housewife. With a chuckle, she added: “Now, there are not too many sales and everything is too neat.”
Crowds were still a common sight in the early 2000s, recalled Pauline Yap who joined Japanese department store Seiyu as a cashier in 2004.
“There were crowds almost every day at Seiyu and if there’s a sale, it would be very busy,” she recalled.
“Once we laid out all the wagons, people will rush to them. But that's how wagon sales work – it creates a different atmosphere, something like this item is a good buy and I see people snatch, I also want (sic).”

MORE CLOSURES, SHRINKING FOOTPRINT
But as competition stiffened, some in the industry started seeing the end of the day.
Yaohan closed in 1997 after its parent company in Japan went bust, while Daimaru shut in 2003. In 2005, Seiyu sold its Singapore business to CapitaLand, which in turn sold it to Beijing Hualian Group (BHG).
John Little shuttered its last outlet at Plaza Singapura in 2016, marking the end of Singapore’s oldest department store which had been open since 1842.
Store closures and the loss of household names continued in recent years, as more thorny challenges emerged.
For one, the appeal of a “one-stop shop” – the greatest strength of a department store – was fast losing relevance by the turn of the century with shopping malls sprouting up across Singapore. 
“One can also say that shopping malls are akin to one big departmental mall,” said Ms Regina Yeo, who is an adjunct assistant professor of marketing at the National University of Singapore Business School.
“Department stores were once popular as they served as a ‘one-stop shop’. There were also fewer shopping centres conveniently located islandwide, so going to department stores was a treat to buy whatever one needs.”
The rise of budget air travel saw people taking their shopping overseas, but the biggest sledgehammer came in the form of e-commerce which upended consumer habits.
Retail therapy can now happen in the comfort of one’s home, with an abundance of options available at the tap of a button. Online shopping platforms and price comparison sites have chipped away at the need for in-store shopping and customer loyalty, especially among the young, said Ms Lim from Singapore Polytechnic.
Department stores, with their overheads and operating expenses, also find it hard to compete with online retailers in price, experts added.
Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered stores for months and sped up the digital shift, has been another deadly blow that Ms Yeo said has “certainly hastened the decline of department stores”.
Moving forward, obstacles are mounting in the form of rising costs and inflation. 
In particular, department stores targeting the mainstream and mid-market segments may take a bigger hit from economic uncertainties, as their customers turn mindful about spending, said Ms Lim.
THE WAY FORWARD
So, what can be done?
Much has been said about going digital, with department stores now having their own online stores or tie-ups with e-commerce players.
Robinsons has also been resurrected as an online-only retailer after being acquired by Canningvale Australia last year. Managing director Jordan Prainito told CNA that sales have been “encouraging”, with “substantial growth” every month.
“As we are a privately held company, we cannot share any specifics, however we can say that millions of Singaporeans have returned to us online in the last 12 months and our year-over-year growth is high.”
Asked if pivoting online was the right way to go, Mr Prainito’s reply was in the affirmative.
“100 per cent,” he wrote in an email. “In a market where costs are surging in all aspects of business … launching an online store is more cost-effective than opening a new brick-and-mortar store.”
Operating online also allows Robinsons to “collect vital data” for product development and supplier acquisition objectives, while providing customers with convenience and other benefits, he added.

But experts are less convinced.
Citing Robinsons as an example, Ms Yeo said the storied brand may still be perceived as “old school” by young shoppers online. On the other hand, former customers may not take to the shift as they prefer to shop in stores.
Ms Lim agreed, noting that self-care products that meet personal needs, such as wellness scents, would still be better bought in stores. Other home essentials, such as bedding and pillows, are also items that people would prefer to touch and feel before making a purchase.
If physical presence is still needed, does the solution lie in having smaller outlets?
In the US for example, department store chain Macy’s has said it is accelerating plans to open smaller stores as a way of keeping up with post-pandemic customer preferences.
Given how rent accounts for a large chunk of operating costs, Ms Lim said this could be an option for local players.
“With the omnichannel concept, consumers may be looking to go to the store to touch and feel certain products as part of their evaluation process. Smaller format stores could be useful to facilitate the ‘select online and check it out in store’ or ‘purchase online and pick up in store’ (options),” she said.
It also makes sense for department stores to move deeper into the suburbs, but experts said they should not forsake Orchard Road entirely.
OG, in an earlier reply to CNA about its decision to shutter its Orchard Point store, said that it intends to open more outlets that are “closer to (its) suburban customers” as part of a long-term strategy. It did not elaborate or reply to subsequent questions about this strategy.
Ms Lim suggested that Orchard Road – still the country’s prime shopping belt and destination for tourists – can be a place for “experiential” retail concepts or differentiated products. Meanwhile, heartland stores can focus on “convenience and functional concepts”.
“There are opportunities for department stores to re-look their store layout, collection of brands that they carry, and explore the provision of a curated, experiential, more holistic customer experience,” she added.
For instance, by bringing in new foreign brands in the form of pop-ups. Foreign brands gain in the form of being able to test a new market, while department stores get the opportunity to curate experiences and showcase new products. The latter can help to generate buzz and in turn, drive in-store traffic, Ms Lim explained.
Simply going online may also no longer be enough amid emerging trends such as livestreaming and “metaverse” shopping.
Citing how mall operator CapitaLand threw a 24-hour digital bash in blockchain-based online world Decentraland in June, Ms Lim said: “This creates excitement for shoppers. Department stores who may not be as agile or adept in meeting consumers’ changing preferences may find themselves at a disadvantage.”

Ironically, it is news of store closures that triggered the return of crowds to department stores.
A day after its announcement, OG saw snaking queues outside its Orchard Point outlet last month. The same happened at Robinsons back in 2020, with throngs of shoppers undeterred by the pandemic.
“This is the Singapore style,” said a brand promoter who wanted to be known only as Mr Oon when approached by CNA on a weekday afternoon. Having worked as a “floater” – one who is hired by brands and “floats” around different department stores to stand in for full-timers – for the past five years, he has been through several closing down sales.
“The first week (after OG’s announcement) was so busy, especially the first and second floor. It was like tsunami; boxes drop here and there because so many people pulling (sic). Staff will rearrange but then everything will drop again.”
These days at the Orchard Point store, Mr Oon can sell more than 10 pairs of shoes a day, up from three or four previously. He expects things to quieten down for a while before the crowds return for the final sale next month.
“Every time got close down then people will come (sic). If not, it’s very quiet,” he said before rushing off to tend to a customer.

WE ARE NOT DINOSAURS: BHG
At least one department store here is ramping up its game to woo customers.
BHG, which currently has three stores after moving out of two locations last year, is in the midst of a three-year transformation plan to spruce up its outlets and refresh brand offerings while integrating technology into the shopping experience.
For instance, at its flagship store in Bugis, interactive touch points allowing shoppers to find out more or virtually try on products can be found around the beauty department. There are also mobile point-of-sales terminals that enable customers to make payments anywhere in the store.
Latest initiatives include a self-checkout system, which BHG said is a first among department stores. It will also partner external parties to hold yoga classes and cooking demonstrations for members at its newly revamped home department in the Bugis store.
And to make the transformation one that is “inside out”, head of store operations Tarquin Yue is also pushing for people transformation. This includes sending employees for training to help them get up to speed with digital tools, but also “more experiential” courses like coffee appreciation and wine appreciation.
“A traditional department store staff probably won’t be able to explain why this glass is good for this wine or why this coffee machine pulls a better shot, so these courses have been very interesting in terms of widening the knowledge scope of our staff who have been brought up in a traditional department store setting,” he said.
These changes are felt most acutely by Ms Yap, who joined Seiyu as a cashier in 2004 and later rose through the ranks to be a manager at BHG's Bugis store.
Throughout her 18 years, she has seen the outlet go through several revamps but one of the biggest changes has been the inclusion of ever more technology in her daily work.
Apart from increasingly nifty point-of-sales terminals, she and her colleagues now have to juggle more devices which serve different mobile wallets or cashless payment services. She also needs to be familiar with the myriad of payment and cashback apps in order to advise customers promptly.
Picking up all these was a challenge at the start, but the 59-year-old brushed them aside, saying that these are necessary.
“Technology must come in, otherwise it’s very hard to attract young customers. People nowadays don’t carry cash and use mobile wallets a lot, so we have to keep up,” she said.
With all these, BHG is hoping to stay relevant amid the shifting tides.
“We want to appeal to not just our traditional customers but also new customers, especially younger ones,” said Mr Yue. “So we try new brands, new digital tools and new ways of selling. At the end of the day, we want to make sure there’s something for everyone.”
Moving forward, BHG is planning to tap artificial intelligence and machine learning to better collect and study data in its next phase of transformation.
“We are going to learn from the data about how customers shop and what they buy, and we are going to personalise the experience for each individual,” he added.

Meanwhile, Isetan said it has been “right sizing” its retail segment in recent years by maintaining stores that are performing up to expectations and in line with the company’s strategy.
“There are presently no plans for us to exit the Singapore retail sector,” the spokesperson said via email.
Asked about upcoming plans to attract shoppers, the department store said it will be resuming physical food fairs and seasonal events. Its upgraded mobile app and e-commerce website also offers customers with a better user experience and wider variety of products.
“The value proposition of department store operators must evolve with changing consumer behaviour and operating environment,” said the spokesperson.
Echoing that, Mr Yue said he believes department stores still have a role to play in the retail landscape.
“The value we have and continue to have is ‘all-in-one’ shopping and as part of our transformation plan, we have broadened that to include in-store services and experiences, digital tools and the many payment options.
“The point I’m trying to get across is that department stores have been evolving,” he said, while pointing out that this is not the first time the industry’s possible demise has been debated.
“Thirty years ago when luxury brands started pulling out of department stores because malls were opening, everyone said department stores were going to die. Later when fashion stores started pulling out, people said department stores were going to die. Well, we did not. We just evolved.”
BHG kept up with this can-do spirit during the pandemic, said a beaming Mr Yue, citing the launch of an e-commerce site in June 2020. The team only had 11 weeks to get the site ready given how the roll-out was brought forward by a year.
The nimble team also got a concept store up and running at Raffles City shopping centre in two weeks. The store, called One Assembly, was launched in January last year as a short-term pop-up but eventually ran for 12 months at the space formerly occupied by Robinsons.
“That was a miracle because CapitaLand approached us 14 days before we opened. Can you imagine how dynamic the team is to work with all the brands, vendors, suppliers, bring in promoters and put everything together in 14 days?” he said.
“There’s always this misperception that department stores are dinosaurs,” Mr Yue added. “If we are indeed dinosaurs, we would have died a long time ago.”"
Police issue written advisory to NUS grad who held up anti-death penalty sign,"The police are taking no further action against Luke Levy, according to tweets by the 24-year-old.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/luke-levy-death-penalty-sign-police-nus-graduation-ceremony-advisory-2930126,"SINGAPORE: The police have issued an advisory to a student from the National University of Singapore (NUS) who held up an anti-death penalty sign during his graduation ceremony in July.
“In response to media queries, the police, in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, have issued a written advisory to a 24-year-old man for holding an anti-death penalty sign at the NUS commencement ceremony on Jul 6 at the NUS Cultural Centre Auditorium,” said the police on Friday (Sep 9).
The man, Luke Levy, on Tuesday tweeted photos of what appeared to be the police advisory.
They showed the police noting that their investigations into the case have been completed and that they have decided to take no further action against Mr Levy.
""You are hereby advised to refrain from such conduct in future,"" the advisory in the photo read.
Describing this as a ""metaphorical finger-wag"" in his Twitter post, Mr Levy admitted that he had been anxious while ""waiting for months"" to find out what action the police would take.
“But I knew that this got people talking about the death penalty,” he said. ""That eased my anxiety. No regrets with what I did.”
Mr Levy added that he would ""keep fighting"" against the death penalty.
















The police had previously said that they were looking into the matter after a report against Mr Levy was lodged.
While an NUS spokesperson confirmed that the university did not make a police report against him, it said its commencement ceremony was ""not a forum for advocacy"".
Mr Levy had alleged then that the university had ""tried their hardest to erase"" what he did on stage, and had edited out his time on stage in a recording of the ceremony.
He also said that in the official stage photograph that he paid for, the photo studio had tried to edit out the words on his sign.

"Singapore must take neutral, secular approach in multireligious society: PM Lee","""What some religions consider a sin should not necessarily therefore be made a crime,” says Mr Lee at the International Conference on Communities of Success.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-neutral-secular-religion-race-377a-2929236,"SINGAPORE: The Government must take a neutral, secular approach in a multireligious society such as Singapore’s, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Sep 9).
But it will also “recognise and respect the different legitimate views and aspirations among Singaporeans, and balance them fairly in order to reach a political accommodation”, he added.
“With give-and-take, all groups can live and let live, and get along together. It's the only way for us,” he said in a keynote speech as guest of honour at the opening ceremony of the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS).
The two-day, inaugural event is organised by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS).
During his speech, Mr Lee noted that while Singapore has come a long way, building a cohesive multiracial multireligious society will forever be a “work in progress”.
“Times and circumstances change, new generations have different life experiences and expectations, and from time to time we need to address new and sensitive issues,” he said.

NDR 2022: Singapore to repeal Section 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage













Mr Lee gave the example of Section 377A - the colonial-era law criminalising sex between men.
“Islam considers homosexual acts to be sinful. Many Christians think so too. But what some religions consider a sin should not necessarily therefore be made a crime,” said the Prime Minister, who announced during his National Day Rally (NDR) speech last month that Singapore would repeal the law.
“Like every human society, Singapore also has gay people in our midst. And like other Singaporeans, gay people want to be respected and accepted just like their fellow citizens.
""For reasons that the Government has explained, we intend to repeal S377A, and to decriminalise sex between men,"" he said.
But Mr Lee also stressed that the Government does not want the repeal to trigger any drastic shift in societal norms; lead to same-sex marriage; or affect the many policies that are based on the existing definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.
The Government intends to uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage, and will amend the Constitution to protect the existing definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in courts, he said, reiterating a point he made at the NDR.
“Muslims are not directly affected by this, because Muslim marriages are governed separately by Muslim law. But understandably, Muslims are concerned too. Hence we have reassured them that they will remain free to preach and practise what Islam teaches on sexuality and marriage,” said Mr Lee.
“The broader social context within which Muslims live in Singapore will not suddenly change.”
Another example of a sensitive issue was the wearing of the Muslim headscarf or tudung in healthcare, he said.
Before changing the rules to allow nurses in the public healthcare sector to wear one with their uniform if they wish, the Government spent years preparing the ground.
“We waited till non-Muslims became more comfortable interacting with Muslims wearing tudung. We held many consultations with different community groups and religious leaders. We made sure that both Muslims and non-Muslims understood what we were doing and what our aim was,” said Mr Lee.
“Finally, last year, we made the change, and I am happy that it has gone smoothly and been well accepted.”
The wearing of tudung by nurses and the repeal of Section 377A are examples of how Singapore approaches such difficult issues to preserve the mutual trust and understanding between different communities, he added.
‘REGARDLESS OF RACE, LANGUAGE OR RELIGION’
On Friday, Mr Lee also said the Government has played an important role in setting the overall direction and tone for Singapore society.
“Our starting point is that it is possible for individuals to be good Muslims – or for that matter, good Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus – while also being good citizens,” he said.
He pointed out that Singapore’s founding fathers were determined to uphold the principle of equality – ""regardless of race, language or religion"", as enshrined in the national pledge.
This has served as an ideal and aspiration for all of Singapore to work towards, generation after generation, said Mr Lee.
“The Government fought with single-minded determination to uphold multiracialism, to bring the different races and religions together, and to reject sectarian or majoritarian politics,” he said.
""Many of our policies and laws have been designed to uphold this principle.""
Mr Lee also spoke about the role of minority and majority communities in Singapore. 
“The minority communities, including Muslims, also contribute and do their part to maintain racial and religious harmony and social cohesion,” he said. “They approach issues with a spirit of mutual understanding and accommodation. They understand that because of our multiracial context, some things have to be done differently from elsewhere.”
Singapore is fortunate to have had Muslim religious leaders who understand this point, Mr Lee pointed out.
He added that it was important for minority communities to maintain the trust and confidence of other groups in society, while also participating fully in the economic and social life of Singapore.
“This includes dispelling fears and suspicions over the spread of extremist ideologies and terrorist threats. In Singapore, our Muslim leaders work closely with the Government and community partners to guide the community in the right direction,” said Mr Lee.
He called on majority groups to also do their part by rejecting majoritarian politics and adopting an attitude of compromise and accommodation.
""In fact, in a multiracial society, the majority group has to go one step further,"" added the Prime Minister.
This means always recognising and respecting the interests of the minorities; realising that in any society it is harder to belong to a minority than a majority group; and being especially mindful never to make the minority groups feel left out, he noted.
“Fortunately, Chinese Singaporeans, as the majority racial group in Singapore, understand this. Perhaps it was easier because while Chinese Singaporeans are the majority race, they belong to different faiths. No religious group forms a majority in Singapore,” Mr Lee said.
But he acknowledged that it has not all been ""sweetness and light"".
From time to time, individuals or groups have overstepped the limits and caused offence to other groups, or tried to exploit race and religion to cause trouble or gain support.
""The Government has had to stand firm, call out and take action against those working up these divisive passions, and convince Singaporeans that that is the surest way to destroy our harmonious society,"" Mr Lee said.
""The Government has done so even at the risk of losing political support and votes.""

But he said that this has been essential to uphold Singapore’s fundamental value of multiracialism, and to protect the delicate balance in society.
“That is how Singapore has been able to get here, with everyone living harmoniously with one another. Everyone understands what is at stake, everyone accepts that no group can get everything which it wants,"" said Mr Lee.
""Everyone supports the overriding need to compromise, adjust and accommodate the sensitivities of other faiths, expand our common space and build a reservoir of trust and respect amongst all Singaporeans.""
He added: “This way, we can continue building a multiracial and multireligious nation where every Singaporean – regardless of race, language or religion – is a valued and respected member of society.
""And where Singapore Muslims, like all other groups in Singapore, can develop their own unique Singaporean identities, different from that of other Muslim communities across the world.”"
"Parliament to discuss new work pass, cannabis and spate of fires in HDB flats ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/parliament-order-paper-sep-12-work-pass-cannabis-hdb-fires-2929361,"SINGAPORE: A newly announced work pass that targets top talent and high-earners is among some of the issues to be discussed at the next Parliament sitting on Monday (Sep 12). 
More than 10 parliamentary questions on the new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass were filed and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng is expected to address the issue in a ministerial statement titled Strengthening Singapore's Position as a Global Hub for Talent. 
The pass will be open to talent from any sector who earns a monthly salary of at least S$30,000, or have “outstanding achievements” in the areas of science and technology, arts and culture, research and academia, or sports.
Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh asked how many such work passes the Government intends to issue and how this may affect job opportunities for Singaporeans. He also wants to know about the objective criteria set for applicants who do not meet the S$30,000 salary threshold. 
MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked whether measures are in place to ensure Singaporeans are not disadvantaged, as holders of this work pass are allowed to work for multiple companies in Singapore at any one time. He also asked about preventing fraudulent applications.
Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Hazel Poa asked how many Singapore citizens and permanent residents would be in direct competition with pass holders for jobs.

Questions were also filed on the use of cannabis, especially in Thailand where consumption of the drug is now legal. The issue was thrust into the spotlight recently following Joseph Schooling's confession that he had taken cannabis overseas.
MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) raised the question of Singapore residents who travel to Thailand and accidentally buy items containing cannabis as they are not able to read ingredient lists written in Thai.  
In a related question, MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) asked what steps the Government has taken to raise awareness about the dangers and prevalence of common food products containing cannabis which are freely available overseas.

Several MPs raised questions about doing more to support teachers, following a move to raise the salaries of Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers, allied educators and MOE kindergarten educators in October. 
MP Dennis Tan Lip Fong (WP-Hougang) asked whether the Government is considering improving working conditions for teachers in other ways, such as adding more staff, to address concerns over a high workload and long hours. 
Besides easing their workloads, MP Hany Soh (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) asked about mental health support for teachers in order to attract and retain talents, and whether the Government will work to extend the salary increment and benefits to MOE teachers seconded to special education schools.

Following a recent spate of home fires in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, MP Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang) asked whether HDB, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) or other agencies plan to step up inspections and issue decluttering notices to residents whose belongings could pose serious fire hazard risks. 
MP Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) asked whether the Government would consider placing fire extinguishers along the common corridor of specified floors for each HDB block and teaching residents how to use these. 
MP Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) asked whether the fire safety hazards of HDB blocks and flats would be reviewed, and how to better mitigate the spread of a fire. She also wants to know whether the policy on the installation of fire-rated doors can be reviewed to allow such doors to be used more.

The Boeing 777-300ER flight SQ333 landed ""uneventfully"" at Baku Heydar Aliyev International Airport at around 6.35am local time (10.35am Singapore time) on Friday.
In a reply to CNA's queries, SIA said there were 229 passengers and 18 crew on board. All disembarked normally.
SIA said it would organise a relief flight to ferry the affected customers and crew back to Singapore and will announce details on this ""in due course"". 
An SIA spokesperson added: ""We are rendering assistance such as providing meals and hotel accommodation to the affected customers.""
""The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.""
According to flight tracker Flightradar24, SQ333 departed from Paris at 11.20pm on Thursday and was scheduled to arrive at Changi Airport at 5.30pm on Friday.

Mr Abe was fatally shot during an election rally on Jul 8.
About 6,000 guests including foreign dignitaries are expected to attend the ceremony for Japan's longest-serving premier, which will be held on Sep 27 at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan hall.
Other world leaders who have confirmed their attendance include US Vice President Kamala Harris and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Japanese officials said in late August that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was planning to attend the event.
A representative from Taiwan will also be there, although the government is still discussing who it will send.
China has not announced who it will send, or if it will send anyone. The Kremlin previously said in July that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be attending the funeral.

Unification Church ex-members in Japan rail at politicians who embraced it













Japan is expected to spend about ¥1.65 billion (US$12 million) on the state funeral, according to the government's new estimate that includes security and reception costs.
The Japanese government had earlier approved a budget of US$1.83 million for the funeral but faced criticism for what was deemed an unrealistic figure that excluded hefty outlays for the security and hosting of VIPs.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decision to hold a state funeral has resulted in widespread public opposition, largely due to revelations of ties between the ruling party and the Unification Church.
The church, founded in South Korea in the 1950s and famous for its mass weddings, has over the years faced questions over how it solicits donations.
The suspect involved in Mr Abe’s assassination had alleged that his mother was bankrupted by the church and blamed the former prime minister for promoting it.
A majority of members of the Japanese public feel that links between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church have not been adequately explained.
A public opinion poll saw disapproval of Mr Kishida's Cabinet edging above 40 per cent for the first time, over doubts on whether his ruling party would be free of ties to the church."
Five on Friday: 5 times we wish Apple would listen to us,"In CNA's regular look at what hit the headlines during the week, Five on Friday imagine what it will be like to give consumer feedback to Apple. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/five-friday-apple-iphone-ipad-watch-headphone-jack-expandable-memory-usb-c-2927516,"You've seen it before - the long, snaking lines of people eagerly waiting to be the one of the first to get their hands on the latest iPhones.
It's very likely to happen again when the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro drop in Singapore on Sep 16. The bigger Plus version will be released a bit later, on Oct 7. And for those who can't wait to secure theirs, pre-orders open on Friday (Sep 9) evening.
Fans of the iPhone would be pleased to hear that the upgraded models will feature a few bells and whistles - from better photographic capacities to an ""emergency SOS"" function that will work even when the device is outside of Wifi coverage.
And wait, there's also a new Apple Watch Ultra for the hardcore athletes. 
While all these features sound great, there are others I wish they would add (or bring back).
In this week's Five on Friday, I imagine what I would suggest to the Apple engineers:
EXPANDABLE MEMORY
I'm about to take a photo of a priceless moment and suddenly, my iPhone suddenly tells me that I'm out of storage space.
This is when I either rush to look through my older files, trying to delete those that aren't important, or I upload to the cloud to free up more space on my phone.
The moment is lost. Have you been in a similar situation?
Sometimes it isn't even photos or videos that are taking up space - it could be the data on the apps you regularly use.
This is when it would be nice to have an iPhone with an expandable memory storage space. Pop in a memory card and you won't have to delete another photo on your phone again. 
Of course, uploading to the cloud is a simple solution - albeit one that also requires a subscription you will need to continue paying for.
In Singapore, the iPhone 14 starts at S$1,299 for the 128GB model and goes up to S$1,799 for the 512GB model. If you want a 512GB iPhone 14 Pro Max, you will need to fork out a whopping S$2,629.
In comparison, you can buy a 512GB Samsung microSD card for about S$120. 
EARPHONE JACK
I like my Bluetooth earphones, I really do.
I like that I can simply connect and go, without worrying about the wires getting all tangled up inside my bag. But I'm also quite forgetful and often forget that they need charging. Sometimes the Bluetooth connection isn't as great as I'd like and it would keep breaking off while I'm trying to listen to music.






      A file photo showing an iPhone and a pair of wired earphones. (Photo: iStock)
    






For times like these, I often think the option to use a pair of wired headphones would be great. 
The iPhone used to feature an earphone jack, but Apple removed it starting with the iPhone 7 in 2016. Consumers criticised the decision at the time, but Apple reasoned that the 3.5mm headphone jack was old technology and not needed in a tech landscape that was increasingly embracing wireless.
As a compromise, it continued to ship iPhones with a pair of headphones that users could plug into the lightning port, for a time. But this meant that you can't listen to music and charge your phone at the same time.
Eventually, they stopped including wired headphones altogether. Instead, Apple started selling their own wireless earphones - the AirPods. 
Those who want to insist on using wired headphones can also opt to buy a 3.5mm jack to lightning USB adapter, but that's an added expense.
So, could we still have the option of a 3.5mm headphone jack since that is universal in most other gadgets?
CHARGING ADAPTER
Just as with headphones, the latest iPhones no longer come with a charging adapter.
This upset the Brazil government enough for it to order Apple to stop selling iPhones without a battery charger in the country, claiming that the tech giant is providing an incomplete produce to buyers. 
Starting with the iPhone 12, Apple stopped including the adapter as part of efforts to become more environment-friendly, it claimed.

According to the company's website, charging adapters ""use the largest amounts of certain materials, including plastic, copper, tin and zinc"".
Reducing the contents of the box also allowed the use of smaller boxes, which lets Apple fit up to 70 per cent more iPhone boxes per shipping pallet, which lowers the company's carbon footprint.
However, Apple still sells the adapter as a separate accessory for those of us who prefer to plug our chargers into an electrical outlet.
While you can use the included lightning cable with any charging adapter you have at home, it might still be nice to have one come with your spanking new phone.
I'm with Brazil on this.

Commentary: Apple’s iPhone 12 comes without a charger. Eco-friendly move or cash grab?













USB TYPE-C
Apple's products use proprietary lightning charging cables - which means you'll always need one for your iPhone.
Many products, including other phone models, now come with USB Type-C cables. For example, you're using wireless headphones and an Android phone, odds are you can just carry one cable and you'd be set.
But this isn't the case for iPhones.
To be fair, the lightning cable can be used for many of their other products, including their wired earphones, iPad tablets as well as their AirPods wireless earphones.
If you're the type that swears by Apple's products, this shouldn't be a problem.
But if like me, you like a little variety with your tech gadgets, then it's a hassle to pack different cables for your Apple and non-Apple products.  
Why can't we just standardise a charging cable for everything?
A MODEL THAT FITS YOUR FRONT POCKET
More people are using their phones for a multitude of purposes, including for work, gaming and even attempting to be the next Quentin Tarantino. 
As a result, many manufacturers - not just Apple - are releasing models with larger screen sizes to accommodate the growing number of functions smartphones can do these days.
Even the smallest model available today - the iPhone 13 mini - measures 13.1cm by 6.42cm. While not as big as its higher-end siblings, it's still slightly bigger than the iPhone 5, which measured 12.3cm by 5.86cm.
So our phones are definitely evolving to look less like a phone and more like a tablet. 
Pretty soon, it will be impossible to simply tuck it into the front pocket of your jeans.
As someone with small hands, I do also miss the ability to use my phone easily with one hand.
An advice to Apple - big isn't necessarily better.

"Jolovan Wham fails in appeal over unlawful assembly outside court, chooses to go to jail again",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jolovan-wham-fails-appeal-over-unlawful-assembly-outside-court-chooses-go-jail-again-2929041,"SINGAPORE: Activist Jolovan Wham will be going to jail instead of paying a fine for the third time, after losing his appeals against his sentence and conviction over an illegal assembly outside the State Courts in 2018.
Wham, 42, took to the High Court on Friday (Sep 9) to appeal against his conviction of one charge of taking part in an assembly in a prohibited area under the Public Order Act. 
He also appealed against his sentence, which was a S$3,000 fine meted out in February. The jail term in default if he does not pay the fine is 15 days.
Wham's charge was for holding up a sign that read ""Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa"" outside the State Courts on the morning of Dec 13, 2018.
Terry Xu Yuanchen, chief editor of The Online Citizen, and Daniel De Costa Augustin were charged that day in the State Courts with criminal defamation over an article written for the now-defunct website.
On Friday, Wham turned up in a shirt with a smiley face on it, along with a group of supporters. He had previously been given a discharge amounting to acquittal for holding up a piece of cardboard with a smiley face in Toa Payoh in another demonstration in March 2020.
His lawyer Johannes Hadi posed a question to the court: ""Does a person need a permit to take a photo outside the State Courts?""
He argued that when there is ""no risk to public order"", such an act does not fall within the definition of an assembly under the Public Order Act. 
If the appeal against conviction was dismissed, he asked for a lower fine of S$1,500 or five days' imprisonment in default instead.
Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong said it was not for Wham to determine whether his activity poses a threat to public order.
He pointed out that Wham's argument that an activity must pose real or potential disruptions to public order before it can be considered an assembly is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with Wham's prior permit application.
Before the incident outside the State Courts on Dec 13, 2018, Wham had filed at least eight applications under the Public Order Act for permits to hold assemblies and or processions between 2010 and 2018.
In particular, Wham applied for a permit on Nov 9, 2018, to hold an assembly for Human Rights Day at the Padang on Dec 10, 2018. He later wrote to the police on Nov 21, 2018, saying: ""I would like to change the location to 15 metres outside the main entrance of the State Courts on 9 December 2018 at 2100 hrs. Is this ok?"" 
His permit application was rejected on Dec 5, 2018, with the police telling Wham that he may wish to hold his event at Speakers' Corner.
The fact that Wham applied for a permit means he regarded what he wanted to do as falling within the permit regime, said Mr Tai.
Wham had taken another similar case all the way to the Court of Appeal, essentially challenging the permit regime, said Mr Tai.
""The whole purpose of this is to put the demonstration on social media,"" he said. ""This is the modus operandi that was used in this case and in my view can be used in the future.""
He added that ""this is essentially what the activists are doing"", saying that the reach on social media is relevant when it comes to sentencing. 
Justice Vincent Hoong said he was of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, adding that he would provide his reasons at a later date. 
Wham confirmed that he has not paid his fine and will instead serve the default 15 days' jail from Friday.
This is the third time Wham is choosing to go to jail instead of paying a fine. The first occasion was in January 2019, when he was fined S$2,000 for organising a public assembly without a permit, in an event titled Civil Disobedience and Social Movements.
The second occasion was in February last year, when he was fined S$4,500 for organising a public assembly without a permit on board an MRT train to commemorate Operation Spectrum."

Letter from President Halimah Yacob to King Charles III
9 September 2022
His Majesty King Charles III
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Your Majesty,  
My husband and I were profoundly saddened by the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
Her Majesty was greatly loved by all. She was, and will forever continue to be, a wellspring of strength and inspiration not just for the British people but also for the people in the Commonwealth and beyond. She will be fondly remembered for dedicating her life to service during her long reign, overseeing a period of remarkable evolution in British society and the United Kingdom’s role in the world. Her passing is an enormous loss to us all.
Her Majesty made three visits to Singapore following our independence – in 1972, 1989, and 2006 – where her warmth and kindness won the hearts of Singaporeans from all walks of life. Her Majesty’s grace and generosity were also keenly felt during the State Visit by former President Dr Tony Tan to London in 2014, where Her Majesty and Prince Philip hosted Dr Tan and Mrs Mary Tan at Buckingham Palace. Being the first-ever State Visit to the United Kingdom by a Singapore President, Her Majesty presided over a momentous occasion in our bilateral relations, and her State Banquet speech paid an inspiring tribute to the two centuries of shared history between Singapore and the United Kingdom, as well as Singapore’s achievements on the eve of our 50th year of independence. All those who have met Her Majesty recall her grace, hospitality and good humour.
Her Majesty will be greatly missed and her passing will be deeply felt by all in the Commonwealth, including Singapore. On behalf of the people of Singapore, my husband and I extend our most heartfelt condolences during this time of grief.
Yours sincerely,
Halimah Yacob

Letter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to King Charles III
9 September 2022
Your Majesty, 
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your mother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
Her Majesty The Queen was the very heart and soul of the United Kingdom. Her reign saw one of the longest periods of peace and prosperity in the United Kingdom. Throughout her life, she steadfastly served the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth with devotion, grace, and humility. Her Majesty was also a noted patron of numerous charities and an ardent supporter of the arts. She helped to raise billions in donations for the world’s major causes, including cancer research, humanitarian aid, sports, the environment, education and training. Her Majesty’s contributions to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and indeed to world affairs will be recorded in history, and she will always be remembered fondly as a great world leader. 
Her Majesty left a significant mark on Singapore’s history and our longstanding relations with the United Kingdom. During her reign, our two countries celebrated many significant milestones. These included Singapore’s hosting of the inaugural Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1971, the 150th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival in Singapore in 1969, as well as the State Visit by President Tony Tan to the United Kingdom in 2014. 
I am honoured to have met Her Majesty several times, most recently in London during the 2018 CHOGM. I warmly recall her State Visits to Singapore – in 1972, 1989 and 2006, especially the lunch I hosted for her at the Fullerton Hotel in 2006. Her Majesty always showed warmth and friendship through her natural affection and spontaneous good humour. Her visits never failed to draw huge crowds; Singaporeans welcomed The Queen enthusiastically when she toured our housing estates, schools and institutions, and other places of interest. Her passing is deeply mourned by all of us in Singapore.  
To Her Majesty, service to the nation and the Commonwealth was an overriding priority in life. As we commemorate her reign, I have no doubt the world will long continue to draw inspiration and strength from Her Majesty’s life story and contributions.   
On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend my sincerest condolences to you and all members of the Royal Family. The Queen will be remembered and missed dearly.
Yours sincerely,
Lee Hsien Loong
His Majesty King Charles III
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Letter from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss
9 September 2022
Dear Prime Minister Truss,
On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you, and the Government and people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, my deepest condolences on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
During her reign, the longest ever in British history, Her Majesty was deeply revered. She stood as a symbol of hope, stability, and continuity, not only for the British people, but all the peoples of the Commonwealth. Her Majesty’s deep sense of duty, unwavering devotion and countless contributions over a lifetime have left an indelible mark on our collective history and inspired millions around the world, including Singaporeans. Being Head of the Commonwealth, her passing is a tremendous loss to the Commonwealth family.  
Singapore’s own history is interwoven with the reign of Her Majesty. At 25, when Her Majesty ascended the throne as The Queen, Singapore was still a British Crown Colony. The new district of Queenstown was so named upon her coronation. Since our independence, we have been honoured to host Her Majesty’s periodic visits to Singapore. During her State Visit in 1972, she witnessed our early nation-building efforts at the Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute and visited Toa Payoh, a new Housing Development Board estate. Over the years, Her Majesty maintained her fondness for and friendship with Singaporeans. On her third State Visit in 2006, she visited the same family she had met in Toa Payoh more than three decades earlier. Despite the many dramatic developments that Singapore had undergone since independence, the bonds of affection between our countries and peoples have endured with the constancy of Her Majesty’s rule of the United Kingdom. 
Our bilateral ties also expanded and deepened significantly during Her Majesty’s reign. The United Kingdom has remained a valued defence partner under the Five Power Defence Arrangements, and last year we were glad to welcome the HMS Queen Elizabeth II to our shores on its historic tour of the region. Our economic relations have prospered with the Bilateral Investment Treaty signed in 1975, and more recently, the landmark UK-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the Digital Economy Agreement. Today, more than 5,500 UK companies are based in Singapore. Our people-to-people links remain excellent, with the UK hosting the biggest Singaporean community in Europe, and British citizens among the top European visitors to Singapore, reflecting our strong shared cultural heritage. 
As we commemorate Her Majesty’s legacy, we also remember her indispensable role in steering the United Kingdom and the modern world through seven decades of peace and prosperity, her selfless commitment to the betterment of the Commonwealth and its peoples, and her pursuit of amity and cooperation among all nations of the world.   
Yours sincerely,
Lee Hsien Loong
The Rt Honourable Elizabeth Truss MP
Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, and Minister for the Union
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland





Statement from Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, Former president of Singapore
Queen Elizabeth II dedicated her life to service.  My wife and I had the honour to welcome her to Singapore in 1989 and to represent Singapore on our Republic’s first State visit to the UK in 2014. Queen Elizabeth II was a most gracious host and we hold her in great respect. She was a source of continuity in a changing and sometimes volatile world. Her life serves as an example of putting country above self.

Court dismisses appeal for shorter jail term by man who sexually abused 4 daughters over 14 years,"The 45-year-old man raped or sexually assaulted four of his daughters between 2004 and 2018.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/court-dismisses-appeal-shorter-jail-term-man-father-sexually-abuse-4-daughters-14-years-bvj-2928856,"SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Friday (Sep 9) dismissed an appeal against sentence by a man who sexually abused four of his daughters over 14 years.
The 45-year-old man, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting his daughters' identities, was sentenced to 33 years and two months' jail in March. He was also given the maximum of 24 strokes of the cane.
He had pleaded guilty to seven charges of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual assault involving penetration, aggravated outrage of modesty and ill-treatment of a child. Another 26 charges were considered in sentencing.
He raped or sexually assaulted four of his daughters between 2004 and 2018, and starved them over five days in 2018 when he was angry with them.
At his sentencing, the judge called his abuse ""horrific"" and said it was ""one of the worst cases of rape and sexual assault"" he had seen.
On Friday, the man mounted his own appeal against the sentence, asking for the jail term to be reduced from 33 years and two months to 28 to 30 years' jail instead.
Speaking via an interpreter to Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Judith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang, the man said: ""I am pleading with your honours if possible to reduce my current sentence.""
""I wish to reiterate that I am a first-time offender and I'm not a repeat offender, as such I'm asking to reduce my sentence,"" said the man. He added that he was not ""asking to be released"".
Chief Justice Menon said: ""Well, he may say he is a first-time offender, but the offences took over a period starting 2004 and continuing until 2015 and so for a long period, in fact it went all the way up to 2018, and there were 33 charges in all.""
He said two dozen of the charges were sexual offences ""committed against his own children"", so this case cannot be seen as a first-time one-off mistake.
Instead, it is ""sustained conduct continued over a long period"", said the Chief Justice.
The appellant then began talking about how some evidence in his case is ""unclear"". He questioned why one of the victims refused some medical examination, and said it ""would not be fair"" for the court to give him such a punishment if the evidence was unclear.
""For example, if there is no clear example with regard to the case ... the DNA from one clothes may be transferred to another person's clothes, but that does not mean (it) comes from me your honour, it could be another person,"" said the man.
The Chief Justice said the man was appealing against sentence and not conviction and there was ""no question about his guilt in this matter"".
""I'm not going to hear arguments about whether the evidence is clear or not clear because the conviction stands,"" said Chief Justice Menon.
The man then gave another reason for his hope that his jail term would be reduced.
""I hope that I will be able to do my mini pilgrimage. If I'm released later at the age of 65 or above, I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to do my pilgrimage,"" he said.
Chief Justice Menon said this ""doesn't make any difference"" because the reduction he was asking for was about two years and he did not think there was any relevance.
""We dismiss the appeal,"" he said. ""There is no error in the judge's assessment.""
The man had begun sexually exploiting his children when his oldest daughter was only six to seven years old, and only his youngest daughter was spared, the sentencing judge noted at the time.
He had taken deliberate steps to separate one of his daughters by taking her to the family's new flat that was still under construction and raping her there. He also sexually groomed her and tried to normalise the abuse by showing her pornography when she was in Primary 5.
The sentencing judge had noted that ""nothing can restore the victims' innocence or compensate for their suffering""."
'Great world leader': PM Lee pays tribute to Queen Elizabeth II after her death,"State flags at all government buildings in Singapore will be flown at half-mast on the day of the funeral as a mark of respect.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-queen-elizabeth-death-tributes-condolences-2928811,"SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II following her death on Thursday (Sep 8), saying that she will always be remembered fondly as a great world leader.
Britain's longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II died peacefully at her home in Scotland on Thursday, aged 96.

‘We just want to revive this brand’: How Canadian Pizza plans to turn its Singapore business around,"At its peak, Canadian Pizza had 36 outlets in Singapore. Its franchiser for the region tells CNA how the company wants to stay relevant to consumers here.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/canadian-pizza-singapore-halved-outlets-revive-business-2922626,"SINGAPORE: Mr Mohamed Abdullah, the CEO of Hobbs Holdings – which runs Canadian Pizza in Singapore – brought up a random conversation that he had with an accountant. 
""He said: 'Oh, you guys still exist?'
""When I asked him if he had ordered Canadian Pizza before, he said: 'Yes ... but I thought you guys closed down.'""
This impression is what Mr Abdullah hopes to change, he told CNA.
""We were not loud. We were there (but) quiet … We didn't have marketing, we didn't have visibility. And we were very happy,” said Mr Abdullah, who took on the job last year after being a franchisee for about 15 years.
“We just want to revive this brand, make it more youthful. We are quite dated, if you ask me. We want to make it more youthful and energised in the market.""
CONSOLIDATION
The brand launched in Canada in 1989, where it is known as Canadian 2 for 1 Pizza. Hobbs Holdings is the master franchise for this region.
Its first Singapore outlet opened in 1995 with just one outlet at Far East Plaza. At its peak, the chain had 36 outlets here, but now has 18 outlets run by 13 franchisees.
“We wanted to consolidate because of the rental hikes, costs, manpower and all that. And of course, competition,” Mr Abdullah said.
Canadian Pizza's popularity here is in part due to it being an affordable option, he pointed out. 
“That’s our niche, that’s our selling point – the '2 for 1' (offer). So we have maintained that until now … If you look at Pizza Hut and Domino's, they have their own target audience, we have our own target audience. Our target audience is the middle-class group in Singapore,” he explained.
“We want to be affordable for people who have less to spend, bigger family to feed, parties, army boys. So this is what we are looking at. We are not looking at people who are going for acquired taste, more expensive. They are not our market.”

And so the “2 for 1” offer has remained until today.
Canadian Pizza also caters to local tastes here and is “very close” to the hearts of customers, Mr Abdullah said. While it started off with Western-style menu options, the chain has become more Singaporean now, he said.
“We don't go for fancy, international flavours and all that. (It is) very down to earth. If you are a Malay, you want something to your tastebuds, we have something. For Indians, we have, for Chinese, we have (it).”
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian Pizza's sales surged threefold on average across its outlets. 
“We had so many orders we didn’t have enough riders to send (the pizzas). So who was sending for me? My pilot friends … We had like 20 cars waiting outside just to deliver pizza,” said Mr Abdullah, who was still a franchisee then.
“At times, (the) outlet was shut for about four to five hours at one time because we couldn't handle orders.” 
While things have stabilised, what happened highlights Canadian Pizza’s place in the market, he said.
“They know who we are. It's just that they are just tired ... forgot (about us), or they find us boring.""
SERVICE, SUPPLY ISSUES
As more customers turn to third-party food delivery platforms, issues such as service standards have cropped up. 
Half of Canadian Pizza's delivery orders are via their website, while the other half are from third-party platforms.
“All this while we have been serving the pizza ourselves, my riders. So we have control over the riders. We have control over customer service, quality and delivery. But now we don't,” said Mr Abdullah.
“When a customer makes these complaints, it is diverted back to us and this affects our image and reputation.”
To entice customers to order directly, Mr Abdullah said he plans to offer more promotions for orders through the Canadian Pizza website.
Manpower and supply chain concerns are problems he is also dealing with in recent times.
“With all these things going on in the world, we have issues of getting our cheese, sauce ... We used to get everything from one particular supplier, but now we have about 20 suppliers,” he said.
To tackle the manpower crunch, Canadian Pizza is looking into automating more of its production. For one, dough production at several outlets has already been automated and Canadian Pizza plans to set up a central kitchen in November.

TURNING THINGS AROUND
Admitting that the brand is seen as “a bit old-school”, Mr Abdullah said he now plans to run things differently.
For one, he is spearheading a push towards sustainability. 
The chain's pizza boxes are currently made from recycled material, and it is looking to make progressive changes to utensils and packaging later this year.
Canadian Pizza also introduced pizzas with plant-based ""meat"" in 2021. While the pizzas have been taken off the menu due to supply issues, it will be reintroducing meat-free sides this month, with pizzas to come later this year.
The chain will also open its first fully dine-in restaurant in January next year.
“My biggest challenge when I took over this business was to make it exciting, (provide) more offerings, give people more choice and to get back into the groove,” said Mr Abdullah.
This means making “a lot of noise” in every way possible and making Canadian Pizza ""exciting"" again, he added.
For one, Canadian Pizza will be the full-season sponsor for all Singapore Premier League matches in 2023. It was one of the partners for a recently concluded e-sports event and is planning further collaborations ahead of the year-end FIFA World Cup.
“We are also going through a rebranding exercise, we are changing the way we look in the market. Traditionally we are hidden under the block in the corner … Now we are paying more attention to logo, brand guidelines, visibility,” he added.
The key is for Canadian Pizza to be at the forefront of people’s minds, he said.
“My target is to make sure that when a person leaves his home, he must either see, hear, eat or touch Canadian Pizza at least once a day.
“That’s the goal. That way, we will always tell people that we are there.”"
Thanksgiving mass marks William Goh's appointment as Singapore's 1st cardinal,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his wife Mdm Ho Ching and several Cabinet Ministers attended the event at St Joseph's Church.

Cardinal Goh, the leader of the Catholic Church in Singapore, was among 20 new cardinals from around the world inducted by Pope Francis at St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican in August.
Thursday's Mass at St Joseph's Church was attended by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his wife Mdm Ho Ching and several Cabinet Ministers.
Twenty-three leaders of various faiths and religious organisations were also in attendance.
Addressing congregants during the homily, Cardinal Goh, 64, described his appointment as beyond his expectation and ""a very humbling experience"".

Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told reporters that he has interacted with Cardinal Goh for years, and was struck by his ""sincerity, the purity of the person, and his deep passion and desire to serve others"".
""In his own typical way, he said a few words just now. He said he doesn't know why he has been appointed a cardinal. I think when you interact with him, we all know why.""
Mr Shanmugam said Cardinal Goh was a perfect fit for the direction of the Catholic Church which Pope Francis has continued to set over the years, which emphasises serving the people.
""It is a great and signal honour to Singapore and to him,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""But I know he doesn't take it as a personal honour, he does it as service.""
Cardinal Goh's appointment was ""historic"" for Singapore, said Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli.
""We appreciate the honour that is bestowed to him for his leadership and his commitment to spread harmony, peace among various faiths,"" said Mr Masagos.
Cardinals serve as the Pope's top advisers and administrators in the Vatican and around the globe, and are second to the Pope in the Catholic Church's hierarchy.
Those below 80 can enter a conclave to elect a new Pope from among themselves, after Pope Francis dies or resigns."

Contractor barred from hiring foreign workers for 3 months after 'serious workplace accident': MOM,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-injuries-manpower-mom-foreign-workers-safety-2927426,"SINGAPORE: A waterproofing contractor has been barred from hiring foreign workers for three months after one of its employees fell more than 8m through a roof and sustained multiple bodily injuries. 
The worker from Le Fong Building Services had stepped on a skylight panel which broke, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a Facebook post on Thursday (Sep 9).
MOM added that he was ""fortunate"" to survive the serious fall, and remains warded in hospital.  
Le Fong's managing director William Lim was called up by the ministry to account for the serious workplace accident - which occurred on Sep 1 - as well as major safety lapses found at the worksite. 
MOM said it inspected the worksite and found unsafe work practices that directly contributed to the accident and posed imminent danger to other workers.

Le Fong was ordered to stop all work at height activities across its worksites, and has been debarred from employing new foreign employees for three months.
It is the first company so far to be subject to stricter measures under a six-month “heightened safety” period from Sep 1 till Feb 28, 2023.
During this period, companies with unsafe workplace conditions or poor risk controls following serious or fatal workplace accidents may be debarred from employing new foreign employees for up to three months.
""In line with new heightened safety measures, Mr Lim had to turn up personally and account to MOM,"" said the ministry. 
""Mr Lim acknowledged the company’s failure to implement a proper system to address safety hazards from working at height.""

MOM added that Mr Lim will need to ensure that rectification is carried out and a robust workplace safety and health system put in place before the stop-work order is lifted.
""Company leaders are in the best position to set a positive culture and shape safety practices on the ground,"" said MOM.
""All company leaders must pay utmost attention to workplace safety and health.""
The ministry urged company leaders to subscribe to the Workplace Safety and Health Council’s alerts, to incorporate lessons from past accidents.
There have been 37 workplace fatalities since the start of the year, equaling the total number of deaths for the whole of 2021."
Another section of Ulu Pandan park connector to reopen after Clementi landslide but flood risk remains: HDB,"The upstream stretch of the Ulu Pandan park connector from the incident site to Clementi Road will remain closed for safety reasons, said HDB.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/clementi-northarc-landslide-ulu-pandan-park-connector-reopen-flood-risk-hdb-2927381,"SINGAPORE: Another part of the Ulu Pandan park connector that was closed after a landslide in Clementi will reopen this weekend, said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Thursday (Sep 8).
The section that reopens on Saturday stretches from Boon Lay Way and the Ayer Rajah Expressway to the Commonwealth Avenue West flyover, which are downstream of the park connector.
The landslide had occurred at the site of the Clementi NorthArc Build-to-Order project last Friday. It injured one passer-by, caused ""soil displacement"" into Sungei Ulu Pandan and damaged part of the Ulu Pandan park connector.
The upstream stretch of the park connector from the incident site to Clementi Road will remain closed for safety reasons, due to “ongoing and planned recovery works and potential flood risk”, said HDB in a Facebook post.
Since the incident last week, HDB and contractor Chiu Teng Construction have widened the channel in Sungei Ulu Pandan from 1.5m to 3.5m and deployed several pumps to improve water flow in the canal.
“These immediate measures were taken to ensure public and workers’ safety, which is our foremost priority, by mitigating the impact of the slope failure and potential flood risk upstream,” said HDB.
However, there is still flood risk to the Ulu Pandan Park Connector and immediate upstream areas, especially during heavy rain, as the canal has yet to be restored, it added.
“We will continue to work with PUB and NParks to closely monitor the water level in the canal and to promptly alert residents and park users of any flood risks,” HDB said.

HDB also said that it is ready to begin the second phase of recovery works, which involves installing sheet piles along the affected stretch of the park connector to reinforce and further stabilise the slope.
“This is a critical phase and needs to be completed before the main recovery and reconstruction works can be carried out safely,” said HDB.
It said that the sheet piles will be driven deep into the ground to create a barrier for the displaced soil in the canal to be safely removed.
The sheet piling works are expected to start this weekend and will take at least a month to complete, added HDB.

In its post, HDB also said that NParks will work with PUB to monitor the rain forecast and water level in the canal. The park connector will be temporarily closed when necessary.
The board also reiterated that the final phase of recovery and reconstruction works are “extensive and expected to take a few months to complete”.
It involves fully restoring the canal, reinstating the damaged part of the park connector and reconstructing the slope and retaining walls within the construction site.
HDB added that it will continue to closely monitor the structural safety of nearby buildings while recovery works are being carried out.
“We seek the patience and understanding of residents and park users who may be inconvenienced during the period of recovery works over the next few months.”
Part of the Ulu Pandan park connector was already reopened on Sunday, two days after the landslide."
Singapore welcomes ratification of Flight Information Region Agreement with Indonesia: MFA,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-welcomes-ratification-flight-information-region-agreement-indonesia-mfa-2927201,"SINGAPORE: Singapore welcomes Indonesia's ratification of the Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta Flight Information Region (FIR) and the Singapore FIR, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Thursday (Sep 8) in response to media queries.
Under the FIR agreement, signed in January at the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders’ Retreat in Bintan, Indonesia will delegate to Singapore the provision of air navigation services in portions of the airspace within the realigned Jakarta FIR. 
The agreement will remain in force for 25 years and shall be extended by mutual consent if both parties find it beneficial to do so. 
A country's FIR is a civil aviation demarcation managed by its air traffic service and does not necessarily follow territorial boundaries.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after the leaders' retreat that the FIR pact would ensure that air traffic control services are provided safely, while allowing Changi Airport to grow in the long term as an international air hub. 
The agreement realigns the FIR boundaries to be “generally in accordance” with Indonesia's territorial boundaries, Mr Lee had said.
Transport Minister S Iswaran also noted in Parliament in February that the FIR Agreement would support the continued growth and competitiveness of Singapore’s air hub and aviation-related sectors.  
Mr Iswaran said then that the agreement ""decisively resolves"" a longstanding issue that had been on the bilateral agenda. 
Previously, Indonesia had repeatedly expressed its wish to take over control of the FIR above Riau islands, which has been managed by Singapore since 1946 as mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Singapore had repeatedly said that the FIR was not an issue of sovereignty, but of the safety and efficiency of commercial air traffic.





TWO REMAINING AGREEMENTS TO BE RATIFIED 
Two other agreements - relating to extradition and defence cooperation - were also signed at the leaders' retreat in January.
In Thursday's statement, the MFA spokesperson added that the Singapore and Indonesian governments had exchanged letters undertaking to bring all three agreements, including the one on FIR, into force at the same time. 
""We look forward to the ratification of the remaining agreements so as to enable the simultaneous implementation of all three agreements,"" MFA added. 
Under the Extradition Treaty, Singapore and Indonesia will grant extradition for a comprehensive list of extraditable offences covered by the treaty, in accordance with the laws of both countries. 
The Defence Cooperation Agreement will strengthen the strategic relationship between both defence establishments, and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Indonesian National Armed Forces, by enhancing cooperation and promoting closer interaction between both armed forces.
Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament in February that the three agreements must enter into force simultaneously to reduce misunderstandings and form a strong basis for future cooperation.

Singapore's law and home affairs ministries refute human rights groups' statements on executions,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/minlaw-mha-icj-ibahri-human-rights-statements-executions-death-row-capital-punishment-drugs-2927016,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday (Sep 8) refuted statements issued by two global human rights groups regarding executions carried out in Singapore, saying they contained “inaccuracies and misconceptions”.
The International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) had published last month statements calling on Singapore to establish a moratorium on executions.
The International Bar Association is made up of legal practitioners, bar associations and law societies from more than 170 countries.
It also claimed that ""in recent months, the Singaporean courts have imposed court orders against lawyers for filing ‘frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process’ late-stage applications on behalf of their death-row clients”.
IBAHRI added that “punitive court cost orders raise concerns around access to justice and effective legal representation and the right to a fair trial”. 
ICJ, which seeks to defend human rights and the rule of law worldwide, also expressed concern over these cost orders.
The “imposition of punitive cost orders has obstructed death-row inmates’ access to justice and effective remedies”, the non-governmental organisation added.
These accounts are inaccurate, said MinLaw and MHA in joint statements to address each organisation.
“In Singapore, all persons facing capital punishment have access to justice and legal representation,” they said.
“If a person charged with a capital offence cannot afford a lawyer, legal counsel will be offered to the person free of charge, regardless of nationality, under the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences. 
“Action has never been taken against lawyers for representing persons facing capital punishment.”
But the right to have counsel defend all defendants does not mean people can abuse the court process, the ministries noted.
“In many jurisdictions, the courts have powers to prevent abuse of the court process.”
Both IBAHRI and ICJ ""cannot be seriously suggesting that it wants abuses of court processes to go unpunished”, said MinLaw and MHA.
SINGAPORE COURT DEALT WITH ABUSE
The ministries said Singapore's Supreme Court has taken steps to deal with abuse in both capital and non-capital cases.
The statements by IBAHRI and ICJ referred to a case involving 24 people who had full legal representation, which had been dismissed by Singapore's Court of Appeal - twice, after the 24 attempted to reopen their case.
Regarding the abuse of court processes, MinLaw and MHA cited the example of an unnamed lawyer whom they described as the subject of six of eight instances in which the Courts had to impose costs orders against lawyers representing persons sentenced to capital punishment.

The same lawyer also admitted to the High Court during one of his applications that his clients had no basis for obtaining the orders applied for, said the ministries.
This lawyer also asked for reliefs that were “procedurally unsustainable as a matter of law”, among other anecdotes cited by MinLaw and MHA as instances of him abusing court processes.
The ICJ had also cited the case of death row prisoner Abdul Rahim Shapiee, whose application for a stay of execution had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
Last month, the Singapore Prisons Service denied claims alleging that it had intentionally obstructed the submission of a legal application in order to facilitate Abdul Rahim's execution.
“The Court of Appeal observed that Abdul Rahim’s application was filed at the eleventh hour, shortly before sentence was to be carried out,” the ministries said on Thursday. 
“The Court of Appeal found that his application was without merit and an abuse of process, and therefore did not warrant a stay of execution.”
ETHNICITY, SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS ‘PLAY NO PART’
In its statement, the IBAHRI also referred to a comment made by United Nations Special Rapporteurs and Working Group members which said that in Singapore, “a disproportionate number of those being sentenced to death for drug-related offences are minority persons and tend to be from economically disadvantaged backgrounds”.
Likewise, the ICJ cited a recommendation by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which asked Singapore to, in relation to offences of drug trafficking, review and amend its “laws and policies leading to racially disparate impacts in the criminal justice system” and to implement “effective national strategies or plans of action aimed at eliminating structural discrimination”. 
""It would be helpful if those who make such comments clarify whether they are suggesting that justice be dependent on the individuals’ ethnicity and socio-economic status,"" said MinLaw and MHA in response.
""Ethnicity and socio-economic status play no part in the professional discharge of duties by law enforcement agencies in Singapore, in the prosecutorial decisions of the Public Prosecutor, and in the decisions of the Courts.”
The ministries added: ""Singapore’s laws apply equally to all, regardless of race, colour, descent, ethnic origin or nationality. All persons are treated equally and accorded due process under our laws.""

NO CONSENSUS ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
On the matter of imposing capital punishment, the ministries also said there was “no basis” to assert that this was a breach of international law.
“There is no international consensus against the use of capital punishment when it is imposed according to the due process of law and with judicial safeguards,” they said.
“Every country has the sovereign right to determine its own criminal justice system, considering its own circumstances and in accordance with its international law obligations. This right should be respected.”
MinLaw and MHA said that in Singapore's experience, capital punishment has had a “clear, deterrent effect"" on drug traffickers, and helped deter major drug syndicates from establishing themselves here.
“Capital punishment in Singapore is applied only to the most serious crimes which cause grave harm to others and to society,” they said. 
“Countries should continue to be free to choose the approach that best suits their own circumstances in their fight against drugs. Singapore will continue to implement measures that have worked well for us.""
The ministries invited both IBAHRI and ICJ to “examine the facts prior to issuing such statements”."

Jail for man who instigated girlfriend to take intimate photos of her mother and threatened to post nudes,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-instigate-girlfriend-take-nudes-mother-threaten-jail-2926866,"SINGAPORE: In a case the defence called ""bizarre and weird"", a man instigated his girlfriend to take private photos of her mother for his sexual gratification.
He also threatened to beat his girlfriend or kill himself if she did not come up with other ways to ""satisfy his sexual desires"".
The 25-year-old man, who cannot be named to protect the identities of his now former girlfriend and her mother, was sentenced to 20 weeks' jail on Thursday (Sep 8).
He pleaded guilty to one count of instigating his ex-girlfriend to commit the offence of voyeurism on her mother, and a second count of threatening to distribute intimate images and recordings of his ex-girlfriend. Another two charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that the offender was in a romantic relationship with the victim, a 23-year-old woman, since 2018. On multiple occasions, the offender recorded videos of himself having sex with the victim.
""These recordings were made with her consent,"" said the prosecutor. 
About five times a week, the offender demanded that his then-girlfriend send him nudes of herself. If she refused, he would threaten to kill himself, beat her or post the nude photos or videos he already had of her online.
As a result of his threats, the woman complied with his requests.
OFFENDER THREATENED GIRLFRIEND
In early 2020, the offender told his girlfriend that the intimate images and recordings ""no longer sufficed to satisfy his sexual desires"", the court heard.
Fearing that the offender would beat her or post her nudes online, the girlfriend suggested that he imagine himself having sex with her mother instead.
The offender agreed, but said it ""would not suffice"" to just imagine and demanded that she take photos of her mother in the nude, court documents stated.
The girlfriend then surreptitiously took a photo of her mother's bare chest when she exited the shower at home, and sent the photo to the offender.
Later that year, the offender posed as his girlfriend and sent nude photos of her to a stranger on a messaging service. 
When the girlfriend asked to end the relationship, the offender would refuse and repeated his threats to beat her and post the nudes online. 
In February last year, the offender told his girlfriend that he ""needed to satisfy his sexual desires"" and demanded that she think of ways to do so. When she replied that she could not, the offender threatened her again.
On another occasion, he repeated his demand and told her to contact strangers for sex. This time, he threatened to upload the photo of his girlfriend's mother and use it as his display picture on social media platforms.
The victim was afraid and downloaded the mobile application Tinder where she contacted strangers and asked for sex, before sending the conversations to the offender as he demanded.
She finally reported the matter to the police on Mar 14, 2021. When the offender learnt of this, he deleted all the messages and intimate footage and photos he had of his girlfriend.
""DEPRAVED"", SAYS PROSECUTOR
Deputy Public Prosecutor Bryont Chin asked for 18 to 21 weeks' jail, citing the severity and frequency of the threats and the fact that the offender was in an intimate relationship with the victim.
""The accused threatened to post the images and recordings on widely used platforms like Instagram and Reddit,"" said Mr Chin. ""When posting, it would have been immortalised on the Internet and further propagated.""
He slammed the offender's ""depravity"", saying he committed the offences ""for his own perverted sexual gratification"".
Defence lawyer S S Dhillon said his client pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.
""From the outset, (I) highlight that this is a bizarre and weird relationship between the first victim and the accused,"" he said.
""On multiple occasions when they engaged in sex, the accused recorded videos showing the victim having sex with him. The recordings were made with her consent. Such is the extent of their relationship. It's not a one-sided affair, but both parties were doing this with consent,"" he said.
He said that it was the victim who suggested the offender imagine having sex with her mother.
District Judge Paul Chan interjected and said he did not consider this mitigatory.
JUDGE REJECTS DEFENCE'S ARGUMENT
""If you consider the circumstances in which the first victim made this suggestion - she did so because she feared the accused would beat her or post her images. It's not mitigatory that it was the first victim who made this suggestion - she was coerced into making this suggestion,"" he said.
Mr Dhillon repeated that this was ""a bizarre and weird relationship"" and said it was also the victim's suggestion for her to have sex with strangers. He said his client was not ""a mastermind of the whole enterprise"".
He said his client is a first-time offender and has a medical record for anxiety attacks and depression, but was unable to obtain the Institute of Mental Health report as he cannot afford it.
Mr Dhillon said his client has since broken off the relationship with the victim and has ""never disturbed her"".
""He realises that he is wrong. He is remorseful and has never reoffended all this time,"" he said.
Judge Chan told the offender that his offences ""are depraved and have no place in our society"".
""I note that while the accused did not perform the act of taking the photographs himself, his culpability was quite high indeed,"" said the judge.
He added that the offence occurred in a context where the offender very frequently threatened to kill himself, beat the victim or post her nudes online.
Hence, the girlfriend was ""compelled to think of an alternative"", he said.
""The first victim merely suggested that the accused imagine himself having sex with the second victim. The accused took this further and demanded that the first victim take photos of the second victim,"" said Judge Chan.
""He knew she could do this as the second victim would not have her guard up against the first victim, who was her own daughter.""
He disagreed with the defence's argument that the offender was not the mastermind."
"Food handlers in wet markets only need to wear a mask if dealing with ready-to-eat, cooked food: SFA",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sfa-masks-wet-markets-food-handlers-ready-eat-cooked-2926766,"SINGAPORE: Food handlers in wet markets only need to wear a mask or spit guard if they are handling cooked food and ready-to-eat food, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in an updated advisory on Thursday (Sep 8).
The agency added that this is similar to requirements for supermarkets, where it only applies to food handlers working at counters involved in ready-to-eat food preparation. These include sushi, roast meat and deli counters, as well as bakeries.
SFA said the updates were made to ""provide greater clarity"" to the industry on mask wearing requirements.
On Aug 29, Singapore eased regulations and made wearing a mask indoors optional, except for public transport and healthcare settings. 
Employers and industry regulators can decide if workers need to wear a mask. SFA said on Aug 24 that existing sector requirements on mask wearing would continue to apply.
“All food handlers will still be required to wear over his nose and mouth a mask or spit guard that is capable of preventing any substance expelled from his mouth or nose from contaminating food,” SFA said in its earlier advisory.





      Who are required to wear masks?
  

Workers are required to wear face masks or spit guards if they are involved in the following:
Preparation of ingredients and/or cooking of food
Packing of cooked and/or ready-to-eat food
Dishing of cooked and/or ready-to-eat food
Preparation of drinks



 Collapse 
Expand






They can use either disposable or reusable masks, but face shields are not approved for use, SFA said. This is because face shields are not considered as being ""effective physical barriers"" due to a large gap at the bottom of the shield. This can still lead to food contamination.
The requirement applies to all staff involved in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at all retail food establishments, including hawker centres, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, trade fairs, as well as non-retail food establishments, including food processing establishments and slaughterhouses.

"Safe-distancing ambassador stole Lego sets while deployed at mall, gets jail","The 34-year-old stole Lego sets from Toys ""R"" Us and a backrest from Self-Fix at VivoCity.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/safe-distancing-ambassador-steal-lego-vivo-city-jail-2926651,"SINGAPORE: A man who was deployed to a mall as a safe-distancing ambassador during the COVID-19 pandemic stole from shops instead, selling Lego sets he filched from Toys ""R"" Us.
The court heard that he was a serial thief with convictions dating back to 2007.
Muhammad Israfael Abdullah was given 20 weeks' jail on Thursday (Sep 8). The 34-year-old pleaded guilty to two counts of theft, with two other charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Israfael was deployed to VivoCity in HarbourFront as a safe-distancing ambassador. While on duty on Jun 13 this year, he went to Toys ""R"" Us three times and stole three Lego sets worth about S$540 by placing them in a tote bag.
He immediately put up advertisements online and sold the Lego sets to an unknown buyer at the vehicle drop-off point at VivoCity that same day.
He received S$100 for the sale and went back to the mall to steal a backrest worth about S$110 from the Self-Fix store.
Israfael's acts were captured on closed-circuit television cameras. A manager of Toys ""R"" Us lodged an electronic police report that afternoon and Israfael was arrested.
The S$100 cash was seized from him, as well as the backrest. The Lego sets have not been recovered and no restitution has been made, said the prosecutor. 
Israfael's charges taken into consideration show that he had stolen from the shops at VivoCity on other occasions: He took Lego sets and a pocket fishing game worth about S$168 in total on Jun 4 this year, and five Lego sets worth about S$390 on Jun 11 this year.
The prosecutor asked for 20 weeks' jail. He listed Israfael's previous convictions: He was sentenced to probation in 2007 for theft, and breached his probation a month later. For his breach, he was fined but instead served four days' jail in default.
In 2009, he was convicted of theft and having unlawful carnal connection with a minor, for which he received seven weeks' jail.
In 2017, he was jailed two weeks for theft. In 2019, he was given four weeks' jail for theft. His latest conviction was in August last year, when he received six weeks' jail for theft.
The prosecutor said the theft in the present case was premeditated and that Israfael was deployed to perform his duties as a safe-distancing ambassador but instead stole from the shops.
""Immediately after stealing the Lego sets, the accused sold them for profit,"" said the prosecutor.
The judge told Israfael that he read his mitigation plea and will not be considering a community-based sentence given that he has ""so many past offences"".
Asked if he had anything else to say, Israfael said: ""Whatever it is, I am prepared to take the 20 weeks.""
The judge told him: ""I hope at some point you will stop stealing. If you continue to do so, you can expect heavier sentences.""
He allowed Israfael to defer his jail term to October to settle some matters, and asked Israfael to stay in court for a while after his case to speak to a court counsellor.
For theft, he could have been jailed up to seven years and fined."

On Tuesday evening, CNB officers arrested the suspect in the Geylang Road area. 
""The man had put up a violent struggle to resist arrest and necessary force was used to subdue him,"" added the agency.
About 134g of Ice, 1.7kg of cannabis, 77g of ketamine, 54g of Ecstasy tablets and 50 Erimin-5 tablets were found. He was then escorted to a hideout in the same area.

The total amount of Ice seized can feed the addiction of about 380 abusers for a week, while the amount of cannabis is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 720 abusers for a week, said CNB. 
Superintendent Stanley Seah, deputy director of CNB's Intelligence Division, said: ""CNB will continue to take decisive and firm action against drug syndicates and traffickers seeking to bring harm to our community and profit off the misery of abusers’ family and loved ones.
""Drugs have no place in our society, and my officers will stop at nothing to bring those involved in this case to justice.""
Those found guilty of trafficking more than 250g of methamphetamine or 500g of cannabis may face the mandatory death penalty."

"Forward Singapore not a political exercise, meant to engage Singaporeans and their diverse views: Lawrence Wong","The repeal of 377A is also “not a done deal” because it has to be discussed in Parliament first, says the Deputy Prime Minister at a conference.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-forward-singapore-political-377a-covid-19-pandemic-2925441,"SINGAPORE: The Forward Singapore initiative is not a political exercise but a national one for those interested in building a better Singapore, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Sep 7). 
Mr Wong was responding to a question at the Young Singaporeans Conference 2022, on how the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) would incorporate diverse views that emerge from an exercise aiming to review and refresh Singapore's social compact.
“We’re not doing a political exercise ... We’re not talking about engaging political parties, we‘re talking about engaging Singaporeans,"" he said.
""Understandably, Singaporeans have diverse views, there will be diverse opinions, and we welcome that.""
Forward Singapore was launched in June by the party's fourth-generation or 4G leadership team.
In April, Mr Wong was named as leader of this team, paving the way for him to become Singapore's next Prime Minister.
He added on Wednesday that the Government would take in feedback and try to reach out to as many people as possible - regardless of their background and political beliefs - to participate in the exercise.
“This is not a political exercise,"" Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, reiterated.
""It is a national exercise for all of us with an interest in building a better Singapore to say, 'let’s come together as one country and let’s think about how we might want Singapore to be greener, to be fairer, to be more inclusive, to be a better society for ourselves and also for our next generation'.""

POLITICAL DIVERSITY
At the conference, which was organised by the Institute of Policy Studies think-tank at the National University of Singapore, Mr Wong also addressed a question on how Forward Singapore accommodates political diversity since it cannot be taken for granted that the PAP would continue to win elections going forward.
“Singaporeans will decide that,"" said the DPM. ""Every election is a free election ... How much diversity, how much checks and balances - that’s really for Singaporeans to decide. 
“Ultimately, from my point of view, in Government now and eventually when we have elections, it’s for us to present our report card to Singaporeans to show what we have achieved … And then to let Singaporeans decide whether or not we have done enough, whether we are deserving of your confidence and trust, and continue to form the Government in Singapore, or if they feel that someone else is better and there are other alternatives they prefer.” 
There is a universal trend and desire for more checks and balances, Mr Wong noted. 
“The likelihood that there will be more political contestation is real. This is true everywhere around the world, it will happen in Singapore too,” he said. 
“That’s why we have been saying … That we should all recognise that every election going forward will not be so straightforward. You cannot assume that it will always be the PAP in Government.”

NDR 2022: Singapore to repeal Section 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage



















CNA Explains: Repealing a law and amending the Singapore Constitution













377A REPEAL
Mr Wong also addressed the repeal of Section 377A on the horizon, and whether there were any viable next steps on the issue of inclusivity for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in Singapore. 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had announced in his National Day Rally last month that the Government would repeal the colonial-era law criminalising sex between men.
But this is “not a done deal” because it has to be discussed in Parliament first, Mr Wong stressed as he noted the ""very strong"" views on both sides. 
“Let’s not even get to what is the next step before we have not even taken the first step,” he said.
“We are repealing 377A because we think that there are considerable legal risks of it being struck down if challenged, and if it’s so, it’s not just 377A, but even the definition of marriage could be struck down on the grounds that it’s unconstitutional.” 
There are large segments in Singapore who ""care deeply"" about marriage as defined currently - between a man and a woman - as well as family norms such as how children are brought up and what is taught in schools, Mr Wong added. 
The Government’s proposal is to repeal 377A but also take steps to amend the Constitution to protect the current definition of marriage from being challenged legally. 
This, said Mr Wong, will assure those concerned that the repeal “is the start of change” - that there will in fact be no change to marriage, family and social norms. 
“Before anticipating, thinking about what future steps we might do, let’s get past this first hurdle and see how we can get to a stage where we find a new balance that the broad majority of Singaporeans will accept, and we can get through this debate without further dividing or polarising our society,” said Mr Wong. 
It’s a real concern for us, that if we can’t even get through this first step without keeping our society together - don’t even talk about next steps.”

PANDEMIC RESPONSE
Mr Wong also discussed the key lessons Singapore took from fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Government is currently reviewing Singapore’s response from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to August last year, before it adopted the approach of living with the virus, said the DPM. 
“There will be lessons, I’m sure. We will look at what we can do to improve, but it’s a continuing thing,” he added. 
For example, Singapore had developed a high-quality contact tracing system during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003.
But COVID-19 showed that this manual system was “not quite the gold standard”, said Mr Wong. 
“It took three days or so to do the contact tracing, by then 'game over', the virus has spread all over. And then we developed an IT solution for it, which is much better,” he added. 
“We will learn the lessons arising from the responses we made, the missteps that took place, the things that could have been done better.” 
However the next pandemic will be different, and “who knows whether the capabilities we built up will be sufficient”, said Mr Wong. 
“I’m sure it will catch us by surprise one way or the other no matter what we do to improve ... Therefore, the ability to learn from our missteps, to continually do better, that is very critical in facing the next pandemic or any crisis.”"
Employers in Singapore no longer need to put up performance bond when hiring Filipino helpers,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/filipino-domestic-helper-performance-bond-bankers-guarantee-performance-foreign-migrant-worker-maid-2925046,"SINGAPORE: The Philippines' Department of Migrant Workers and Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Wednesday (Sep 7) announced that a banker's guarantee and performance bond would no longer be required when hiring Filipino domestic workers in Singapore. 
Singaporean employment agencies and employers are required to purchase a performance bond of S$7,000 when hiring a Filipino helper.
The bond is a contract between the employer and the Philippines Embassy to ensure that the helper gets proper and fair treatment while working in Singapore. 
It is required if the helper plans to go back to the Philippines for home leave or if she wishes to renew her passport. 
CNA has reached out to MOM and the Philippines' Migrant Workers Department for more information.
In a joint press release, the two agencies said the removal of the bond requirements was in recognition of the ""deep and abiding friendship"" between the Philippines and Singapore; and a ""concrete outcome"" of the first state visit of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr from Tuesday to Wednesday.

This is also Mr Marcos' first overseas trip as president, and he and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong witnessed the signing of several bilateral agreements on Wednesday.
Singapore's Manpower Minister Tan See Leng expressed his appreciation for the removal of the performance bond requirement and affirmed Singapore's commitment to protecting the well-being of all migrant workers in the country, said the press release.
Separate from the performance bond of S$7,000 for Filipino helpers, employers in Singapore are also required to buy a S$5,000 security bond for helpers of all nationalities, except Malaysians.
The security bond is a pledge to pay the Singapore Government if either the employer or the helper breaks the law or work permit conditions. This requirement remains in place.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said employers and employment agencies in Singapore would no longer be required to purchase a security bond when hiring Filipino domestic workers. That is incorrect. The performance bond requirement has been removed but the security bond requirement remains in place. We apologise for the error."
Handling of meat with bare hands among lapses found at meat processing facility: SFA,"Mua Hin Poultry Farm was fined S$24,000 for multiple hygiene-related offences.

Mua Hin Poultry Farm, a meat processing establishment located at Senoko Crescent, was found to have flouted hygiene-related rules when SFA officers inspected the premises in April, June and August.
The lapses included packing of roasted poultry at the loading bay, storage of raw meat and poultry outside the premises, and handing of roasted meat with bare hands.
Food safety is a joint responsibility as food can be contaminated anywhere along the food chain, said SFA. 
The agency added that it continues to be vigilant and works to ensure that regulatory measures are in place and properly enforced, the industry and consumers must also play their part. 
""All food establishments should ensure that their premises are clean and well-maintained, as well as adhere to proper food hygiene and food safety requirements,"" SFA added in a news release. 
Under the Wholesome Meat and Fish Act, those found guilty face a fine of up to S$10,000, up to 12 months' jail, or both.

Wet market vegetable sellers in Singapore say prices up to 30% higher as heavy rain hits Malaysian crops,"Vegetable prices from Malaysia have risen across the board. Stallholders in Singapore single out red chilli and coriander among affected crops.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/malaysia-rain-flood-vegetables-crop-price-cost-rise-wet-markets-2924886,"SINGAPORE: Vegetable sellers in Singapore have been affected by continuous heavy rainfall in Malaysia that has depleted vegetable crop yields across the country.
Stallholders at three wet markets told CNA on Wednesday (Sep 7) that prices of vegetables have risen by 10 to 30 per cent during the rainy season.
CNA has reported on prolonged rains in Malaysia over the last few weeks hitting crop-producing areas in Melaka and the Cameron Highlands, and vegetable markets such as in Kuala Lumpur.
The overall supply of vegetables has dipped 20 to 30 per cent, especially affecting crops like spinach, bok choy, long bean and okra that are grown in open farms, said the president of the Malaysian wholesaler vegetable association.
Wet weather is likely to continue in many parts of Malaysia until February 2023 due to the annual north-east monsoon, according to the Malaysian meteorological department.
Over in Singapore, at various stalls CNA visited on Wednesday, vegetables from Malaysia still formed a majority of the produce. Local sellers identified Malaysia's rainy season as the cause of the ongoing price spikes.
When asked which vegetables were most affected, some immediately pointed to red chilli, now going for S$7.50 to S$8.50 per kg, up from S$4 to S$5. One stallholder also pointed to coriander, which he said he has been buying at S$15 per kg over the past month. It used to cost from S$7 to S$8 per kg.

Leafy greens like kang kong and chye sim now cost S$3.50 to S$4 per kg, up from S$2.50 previously, according to multiple sellers.
Some said that prices have risen more in the past two to three weeks, while others said the upward trend has continued for a few months now. 
Hardier vegetables like cucumbers, bittergourd and eggplant rose to S$3 per kg last month because of the rain, although they fell back to S$2 this week, stallholder Lin Shi Fei told CNA at Redhill Market.
Heavy rain also meant that the vegetables importers managed to bring in were ""not pretty"" and turned bad more easily, said Ms Lin.
Many said they have been stocking smaller quantities. A stallholder at Redhill Market who only wanted to be known as Ms Lee said she was getting 2kg to 3kg of leafy greens daily from her supplier at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, down from 4kg to 5kg usually.

Price fluctuations precipitated by seasonal rains up north is not new to the long-time vegetable vendors.
But what makes the latest price leaps worrying is that they come on top of the difficulties sellers have experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a stallholder at Beo Crescent Market told CNA.
""Prices of vegetables have gone up incredibly, incredibly – very, very scary,"" said the seller, who only wanted to be known as Mr Ng.
Recent rains and floods ""play a part"", but Mr Ng's view was that the core issue was a manpower crunch in Malaysia affecting productivity and subsequent yields.
""It's constantly a problem, and then it doesn't help when the flooding comes,"" he said at his family-owned shop, Ah Har Vegetable Stall.

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
Like other stallholders, Mr Ng has been stocking smaller quantities of vegetables due to a combination of the higher costs and suppliers not being able to meet demand.
He said the situation has eaten into his profit margin, especially as he tries to keep prices stable for customers.
Citing calamansi as an example, he said that when the citrus cost about S$1 per kg, he could set his prices at S$2 to S$2.50 per kg.
But when the price recently rose to S$3.20, his profit margin fell to 80 cents as he capped the price at S$4 so as not to put off customers.
These factors have forced Mr Ng and other vegetable vendors to look for alternative sources in the region.

Red chillies from Vietnam have become a popular and cheaper alternative. But not all customers are willing to switch to vegetables from different origins.
One stallholder at Tekka Centre told CNA she continued to stock only Malaysia-grown chillies as her customers found that the Vietnam-grown variety was not as spicy and did not suit their palates.
Mr Ng said he was bringing in long beans, kang kong, okra and bittergourd from Thailand, adding: ""These are things that we usually don’t bring in from Thailand, but no choice.""
Those grown in Thailand can be about S$1 cheaper than those from Malaysia, he said.
He has also started to try out marketing promotions at his stall, such as bundle deals of S$5 for three packets of vegetables.
Asked whether he thinks prices from Malaysia will come down any time soon, Mr Ng expressed doubt and frustration.
He said: ""What I think is that when things go up, it will never go down. It's very difficult to go down. Because people already know, you are able to pay this price already. So why would they need to go down?"""

Interpol red notice issued against ex-Wirecard Asia vice president who fled Singapore,"Edo Kurniawan is suspected to have conspired with others to embezzle funds amounting to up to S$100,000, but left Singapore before investigations started. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wirecard-interpol-red-notice-edo-kurniawan-2924871,"SINGAPORE: An Interpol red notice was issued on Aug 22 against a former vice president at Wirecard Asia Holding, after he left Singapore before investigations into alleged embezzlement offences began. 
Edo Kurniawan was vice president of controlling and finance at the firm - a Singapore subsidiary of German payment and financial services provider Wirecard AG - when he allegedly conspired with three former colleagues and Henry Yeo Chiew Hai to misappropriate funds from Wirecard Asia among other offences.
The three former employees are James Aga Wardhana, Chai Ai Lim and See Lee Wee. All three and Yeo, a director of Singapore firm Jacobson Fareast Marketing Services, were charged in court on Aug 17. 
A warrant of arrest was issued against Edo then, and on Wednesday (Sep 7) the Singapore Police Force added in a press release that an Interpol red notice was also issued against him on Aug 22.
Interpol red notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person - pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.
Red notices are published by Interpol at the request of member countries, of which Singapore is one.

Both the Interpol red notice and arrest warrant were issued against Edo for allegedly engaging in conspiracies with the four men to commit criminal breach of trust in siphoning between S$41,200 to S$100,000 from Wirecard Asia between May and December 2018.
Edo is also suspected of abetting Yeo to falsify invoices totalling S$184,870 from Jacobson Fareast to Wirecard Asia, and acquiring benefits from criminal conduct from the alleged conspiracies.
He also allegedly abetted Wardhana and See to transfer S$159,250 of benefits from criminal conduct to people within Singapore.
So far, seven men in Singapore have been charged in connection to the Wirecard case, which was sparked by the company's collapse in June 2020 after its auditor could not verify €1.9 billion (S$2.7 billion) supposedly held abroad in escrow by third-party partners, and subsequently refused to sign off on 2019 accounts.
Several Wirecard executives, including former chief executive Markus Braun, have been arrested on fraud charges.
Anyone with information on Edo's whereabouts is requested to call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 (or +65 6255 0000 for overseas callers) or submit information online. All information received will be kept strictly confidential, said the Singapore police."
Phoon Chiu Yoke seeks court's green light to leave Singapore after being charged again for not wearing mask,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/phoon-chiu-yoke-badge-lady-leave-singapore-charge-not-wearing-mask-china-2924911,"SINGAPORE: Hours after being charged with new offences of failing to wear a mask, a woman returned to court to seek the green light to leave the country.
Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, said she had already planned to go to China via Hong Kong before she was informed about the latest charges.
Phoon received two charges on Wednesday (Sep 7) morning for failing to wear a mask on Orchard Road a few weeks before outdoor mask rules were relaxed. She was also given a third charge of failing to turn up for an investigation by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) for failing to wear a mask.
On Wednesday afternoon, Phoon returned to court for an application to leave jurisdiction.
The police prosecutor opened by saying that STB had updated that Phoon faces a fourth pending charge that has yet to be tendered. On the application to leave Singapore, the prosecutor has asked for the case to be fixed on Monday for them to consider it as they do not yet have the details.
The judge told Phoon that the documents she had tendered for her application to leave the country were incomplete. Phoon intends to leave Singapore for China via Hong Kong on Sep 13.
However, the judge said she provided only her itinerary for travel within China and not one for Hong Kong nor any ticket from Singapore to Hong Kong or China.
Phoon explained that she intended to travel by land from Hong Kong to Shenzhen.
The judge said she did not have any tickets for her travel from Singapore to Hong Kong, and questioned Phoon on whether she would be able to travel to China without relevant approvals.
Phoon said she had checked with the authorities and claimed that she can enter China for 14 days without a visa nor quarantine. 
""Are you able to show me all the relevant documentation that you are able to travel to China without 14 days' quarantine?"" asked the judge.
""I can enter for 14 days and return on the 15th day without a visa,"" Phoon answered.
""Even if you are a tourist? Because I understand they have a closed-door policy,"" said the judge.
""When I bought the tickets, I checked both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website as well as the airline website requirements,"" answered Phoon.
She explained that she received the summons to court only on Sep 2, but had made her travel plans two weeks ago.
Travellers to China must undergo a seven-day centralised quarantine, followed by three days of home monitoring for most cities, said the country's National Health Commission on Jun 27.
Singaporeans are advised to check with the local authorities on the quarantine and other policies that they must adhere to, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on its website. 
The judge asked Phoon to submit the remaining required documentation and adjourned the case to Monday, when the request will be considered."
"Woman jailed for breaching COVID-19 quarantine to shop, collect 4D winnings and get vaccinated",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-jailed-breach-covid-19-quarantine-collect-4d-winnings-2924671,"SINGAPORE: Despite knowing that she was quarantined as she was a close contact of a COVID-19 case, a woman repeatedly breached quarantine by going out to window shop, collect lottery winnings and get vaccinated.
Ang Siew Wah, 60, repeatedly shouted at Certis Cisco call agents and demanded to know who would support her and that she needed to eat.
Ang was jailed for nine weeks on Wednesday (Sep 7). She pleaded guilty to one count under the Infectious Diseases Act of exposing others to the risk of infection, with another four charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that a Certis Cisco call agent got in touch with Ang on behalf of the Ministry of Health (MOH) on the morning of Jul 23 last year to speak to her about her quarantine order.
In the call, Ang confirmed that she had received a notification from MOH the day before that she was under quarantine from Jul 22 to Jul 29, 2021, as she was a contact of a COVID-19 patient.
Ang asked the agent about an upcoming COVID-19 vaccination appointment. Ang was told she had to reschedule it as she was not allowed to go out.
Ang retorted: ""Then don't need to buy medicine lah, don't need to eat lah, that means cannot go out cannot eat lah.""
The agent told Ang that she had to stay in a hotel for her quarantine, but Ang shouted at her: ""You are kidding me, I don't like to stay hotel, I want to stay at home.""
ANG TUSSLED WITH AGENTS OVER THE PHONE
Two agents called Ang multiple times because they either could not hear her properly or because Ang claimed she was working and had ""no time"" for them.
When told she could not work as she was under quarantine, Ang said: ""I need money to eat. Who wants to support me?""
She repeated such remarks over multiple calls, and the agent eventually told Ang that if she wanted to quarantine herself at home instead of in a hotel, then her husband would also not be allowed to leave the house. 
Ang shouted: ""Hello! You are nonsense ah. If my husband cannot go out, how do we eat? Call MOH, call government to talk to me ok?""
A different agent called Ang that same morning and repeated the information to her, to which Ang replied in a similar fashion.
She then claimed that she was working, and when the agent told her she had to inform her employer that she was under quarantine, Ang repeated her argument about needing to ""survive"".
FLOUTED QUARANTINE ORDER THAT SAME DAY
After the phone calls, Ang went out for about seven-and-a-half hours on the same day.
From about 10.20am to about 5.45pm on Jul 23, 2021, she went to Kovan MRT station and Heartland Mall to eat, window shop and collect her 4D winnings. Court documents did not indicate how much these were.
She returned by bus in the evening and was not working as she had claimed.
She continued to head out over the next few days despite knowing she was under quarantine. On Jul 24, 2021, she took a bus to Ang Mo Kio on separate occasions to buy lunch and dinner.
The following day, she again travelled by bus, this time to Teck Ghee Community Centre for her COVID-19 vaccination, even though she had been told not to do so. She also made bus trips to buy food on Jul 28 and Jul 29, 2021, and did not return to her workplace throughout her quarantine period.
A RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTOR
The prosecution asked for nine to 10 weeks' jail for Ang, calling her a ""recalcitrant offender who clearly did not intend to comply with the quarantine order"".
She shouted at the call agents and lied to them that she was at work, said the prosecutor.
""In fact, she was out for frivolous purposes, to window shop and to collect 4D winnings,"" she added.
The prosecutor said it was ""purely fortuitous"" that Ang tested negative for COVID-19 on Jul 28, 2021.
Ang has a previous conviction in 2005 for theft, for which she served 10 weeks in jail.
In mitigation, she told the judge via a Mandarin interpreter that she did not know the law.
""I'm pleading for leniency. Please give me a lighter sentence,"" she said.
In response, the prosecutor said that ignorance of the law is not a defence, adding that Ang had repeatedly acknowledged during the phone calls that she knew she was under quarantine.
The judge said Ang had no intention of complying with the order from the outset. After being informed that she had to stay at home, she promptly left home and continued to do so on four of the remaining six days of her quarantine period, said the judge.
""Such wilful non-compliance with measures to contain the spread of the virus warrant a sufficiently stiff sentence that will deter others from ... such conduct that affects public health and safety,"" she said."

Singapore Customs said its officers conducted an operation on Monday at an industrial building near Corporation Drive, where they kept watch on a unit that two men had entered earlier.
As one of the men was exiting the building, the officers moved in to conduct a check.
A total of 3,744 cartons of contraband cigarettes were found wrapped in black trash bags. There were also 288 empty green baskets that were believed to have been used as cover loads for the duty-unpaid cigarettes. 
Both men, a 38-year-old Bangladeshi and a 24-year-old Singaporean, were arrested.

The total duty and Goods and Services Tax evaded amounted to about S$319,730 and $25,440 respectively. Investigations are ongoing.
""Buying, selling, conveying, delivering, storing, keeping, having in possession or dealing with duty-unpaid goods are serious offences under the Customs Act and the GST Act,"" said the agency.
Offenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded, jailed for up to six years, or both.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/phoon-chiu-yoke-badge-lady-new-charges-not-wearing-mask-court-2924386,"SINGAPORE: A woman who was jailed last year for breaking multiple COVID-19 regulations was brought back to court on Wednesday (Sep 7) for fresh charges of failing to wear a mask when required.
Phoon Chiu Yoke, 55, received three new charges on Wednesday. Two are for breaching COVID-19 regulations by failing to wear a mask when it was required and one charge is under the Infectious Diseases Act for not complying with an officer during investigations.
She is accused of failing to wear a mask over her nose and mouth along Mandarin Gallery in Orchard Road at about 3pm on Mar 6. A second similar charge states that she did not wear a mask outside Victoria's Secret in Orchard Road about half an hour later that same day.
Phoon is also charged with failing to attend an investigation for not wearing a mask. She was supposed to be at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Mar 31 this year.
STB said in March this year that investigations were ongoing after influencer Xiaxue, or Wendy Cheng, posted an Instagram Story in March of Phoon walking along Orchard Road without a mask on.
On Wednesday, Phoon turned up unrepresented. The prosecution said that they are ready with the case and intend to proceed on a mask charge and the charge of failing to attend the investigation, with the other mask charge taken into consideration for sentencing.
Phoon asked if he could explain what taken into consideration means and told the judge she would ""probably be self-represented"".
She also said she intended to ""plea with mitigation factors"". Phoon will return to court for a pre-trial conference in October.
Phoon hit the news last year when a video of her not wearing a mask at Marina Bay Sands went viral. She was filmed removing her mask outside the State Courts and received another charge for this.
She was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail in September last year.
On Mar 29, wearing a mask outdoors in Singapore was made optional. That was extended to indoor areas - except on public transport and in healthcare facilities - on Aug 29.
If convicted of failing to wear a mask when required, Phoon could be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$20,000 or both as a repeat offender.
The penalties are the same for a repeat offence of not complying with an officer during investigations under the Infectious Diseases Act.

"In Braddell, construction is causing this building to vibrate. Residents might have to endure it for many more years","Residents at Block 10D of Braddell View are also affected by noise from the construction of the North-South Corridor and Mount Alvernia Hospital's new centre. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/braddell-view-construction-north-south-corridor-vibrations-lta-2915916,"SINGAPORE: The construction did not bother Madam Christina Fong, until the ""terrible earthquake sensation"" she experienced about a month ago changed her mind. 
""It feels like your building is going to collapse anytime. I feel my body moving. Even when I lie down, I can feel it. It does disrupt my sleep and even my work,"" the 65-year-old resident of Block 10D at Braddell View told CNA. 
""Initially I didn't feel it, until my daughter was in the room and she said: 'Mummy, why is something shaking?' Then I realised. When you're walking around, you don't feel it. Then one day when I was doing my work on the computer, I felt it."" 
Braddell View is a former Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) estate, which is now privatised. At Block 10D, each floor comprises four units, two of which are in closer proximity to the construction at this stage. 
Construction for two major projects – the North-South Corridor and Mount Alvernia Hospital's new centre – fronts the block which faces Marymount Road. The former caused the recent vibrations felt by residents. 
The 21.5km-long North-South Corridor will be Singapore's first integrated transport corridor when it opens in 2027. With express bus lanes, pedestrian paths and cycling trunk routes, the corridor will connect towns in the northern region to the city centre.

With the North-South Corridor about five years to completion and construction for the hospital having begun about two to three years ago, residents in 10D Braddell View only got a period of respite during the COVID-19 pandemic when works had to be halted. 
Mdm Fong, whose 20th-floor unit happens to be closer to the construction, is not the only resident in distress. 
CNA spoke to other residents about the pains of living in a building subjected to the inconvenience caused by years of construction happening at one's doorstep. Those who spoke to CNA live on the 19th floor and above. Most requested to be anonymous for confidentiality. 
""PLAGUING US FOR 3 TO 4 YEARS"" 
Tina, a domestic helper who has worked in her employer's home at Braddell View for 13 years, said she started to experience the vibrations a few months ago about once to twice a week. 
""It's like I can see something shaking. My table, my bed. I think the other month (it woke me up from my sleep). And also when I'm cooking, the glass (is shaking). And then I felt dizzy,"" the 53-year-old recalled. 
""When it first happened, I thought it was an earthquake. I'm alone at home, so I felt scared.""

On another floor, 30-year-old sisters Anita and Laura echoed their neighbours, saying the vibrations ""feel like a mini earthquake"". 
""It feels unnatural. Sometimes even when the vibration stops, you think about it ... and it's also a bit unnerving, because we're (around) the 20th floor,"" said Anita, adding that the vibrations have affected her sleep. 
""My neighbour told my mum that she gets headaches from the vibration. I don't really get that, but it's more like I can't sleep, then the next day I get a headache because I couldn't sleep."" 
""I was taking an exam and I thought my chair was vibrating, because I'm so used to my chair vibrating,"" added Laura. 
But while the vibrations only started happening recently, Anita and Laura said the construction noise started before the COVID-19 pandemic.
In fact, the construction ""has been plaguing us for three, four years"", and it disrupts them several times a week, the sisters added. 
""We've woken up at Saturday 8am before to heavy pounding. The pounding stage is thankfully over. Now it's constant droning."" 
To cope, Anita uses noise cancelling headphones when she's working from home, but come night time, ""it's unbearable"". 
""I don't know why they work throughout the night. I feel like they should, if they can, not do (it) at night. Because it's disruptive to sleep cycles,"" she said.

RESIGNED TO REALITY  
Many residents who spoke to CNA said they had no choice but to live with it.
Mr Koh's wife said authorities had already preempted residents about the vibrations. She said she does not feel too distressed about it, ""as long as it does not affect the whole building"".
For 33-year-old Duane, who works from home occasionally, the vibrations used to cause things such as his computer monitor to wobble. And when he lay down, ""it was like (you were on) a boat"", he said. 
But he was not too bothered, as he said he hadn't felt the vibrations since almost a month ago. 
Living on the highest floor, another resident Ms He said the vibration was ""definitely not just felt by one unit"", although she believes the vibrations are ""particularly strong"" from her floor. 
Still, she expressed resignation about the disruption it has caused to her life. 
""The North-South Corridor still has a few more years to go before it's complete, so I feel like we have no choice. This is a huge project ... so we have to endure. Hopefully it'll get better soon,"" she told CNA in Mandarin.
""And I'm a foreigner, so I'm not sure where do I even go for assistance."" 






      The bus stop located right outside the side entrance at Block 10D Braddell View has been moved to a location about a 10- to 15-minute walk away, said residents. (Photo: CNA/Grace Yeoh) 
    






BUS STOP MOVED FURTHER AWAY 
Then there are also other consequences of the construction that have left residents upset.
Some residents were unhappy that the bus stop which used to be located right outside the side gate beside their block had been moved further down the road towards Marymount Convent School.
""That causes very much inconvenience to us especially during the rain. And also when my daughter comes back from work, around 10 to 11pm, she has to walk back. It's so quiet and dark, and there is no shelter,"" said Mdm Fong. 
Her neighbour one floor down shared the same sentiment. The 72-year-old retiree, Mr Koh, pointed out that the bus stop used to be ""a few steps (from) our gate, and now it's 50 metres"".

AUTHORITIES ASSISTING RESIDENTS
Samsung C&T, who is the contractor, has been communicating with several residents over WhatsApp.
Mr Tan, a 73-year-old retiree, told CNA that they explained to him over WhatsApp that ""some of the works, they can't stop"". 
While current vibrations and noise have not affected his family too much, he believes it will get worse next year, having been told that construction will move closer to his side of the building. 
When CNA caught Mr Samuel Wong as he was leaving home, the 64-year-old public relations consultant said he found the PR skills used to handle residents' complaints ""very impressive"". 
""They have done a very good PR job. I'm in PR so I should know. They've gotten people to come down to meet everyone. And every other day, I get a WhatsApp (message) from them, saying, 'Oh today we're going to be doing (this and that), it may cause a lot of noise,'"" he said. 
""Every message has got my name, so they customise every individual text. That's a feat. Every few days I'm getting texts from them."" 
Mr Wong also showed CNA the WhatsApp messages he was sent from a representative of Samsung C&T, most of which detailed upcoming construction works. 
While Mr Wong said he ""usually sleeps quite soundly"" and has even slept through actual earthquakes, his flatmate has felt the vibrations. And even though he has noticed the noise, he thought more noise came from the construction of Mount Alvernia Hospital's new centre than the North-South Corridor.

“MITIGATION MEASURES” PRESENT, BUT SOME WORKS HAVE TO CARRY ON AFTER 10PM 
Responding to CNA’s queries about the inconvenience to residents, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it has been engaging Braddell View MCST and residents regularly to update them on the progress of the North-South Corridor construction along Marymount Road fronting Braddell View. 
It will “continue to engage them and do more to improve the situation wherever possible”. 
In a letter sent to residents on Jun 21, which was seen by CNA, LTA outlined an estimation of when major construction activities of the North-South Corridor in the vicinity of Braddell View would be complete, beginning with the tunnel diaphragm wall works in 2024.
Tunnel construction is estimated to be completed in 2026, while the reinstatement of the road and opening of the North-South Corridor is estimated to be done in 2027, the letter stated. 
To minimise inconvenience to residents, LTA said it plans construction activities such that “relatively noisier works are carried out in the day and works cease by 10pm on most days”. 
“However, we seek the understanding of residents and stakeholders that works may occasionally have to go past 10pm for works which cannot be safely stopped and continued the next day,” it added. 
“An example is the ongoing works for (the) diaphragm wall which provides critical support for underground structures. The works involve deep excavation and pouring large amounts of concrete, and must be constructed in one continuous operation for safety reasons.” 
LTA noted that it typically implements a series of mitigation measures during the various stages of construction, including at this site, to minimise construction-related noise. 
“For example at this site, noise enclosures and mufflers have been fitted on machineries to reduce noise levels. We will also be installing noise barriers at this location by November this year,"" LTA said. 
Nonetheless, LTA’s engineers are closely monitoring the vibrations caused to Braddell View, using data from monitoring equipment in the estate, said LTA. To date, the vibrations emitted from the site have been “within safe limits”.

But “safe” is not good enough for sisters Anita and Laura, who did not feel like talking to authorities helped their situation. 
Their father engages with the authorities quite regularly, because he has woken up a few times at night, they said. 
""In the beginning when they worked through the night, it kind of shocked him. But I think now he's a bit more resigned. He doesn't have that 'we need to take action' (stance). It's more like he calls them then they come and have a chit chat,"" said Anita. 
The sisters have also called LTA themselves to complain, but ""unfortunately when they came, the vibrations stopped"", they said.
Authorities also checked the vibration monitoring equipment located on the 21st floor of their building, and assured them ""it's completely safe"". 
Added Laura: “They are always like, 'Yeah, we understand your concerns', but it still occurs over and over again.”"
"ABC Sweet Soy Sauce, Sambal Ayam Goreng Sauce among 3 products recalled due to undeclared allergens",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/abc-sweet-soy-sauce-sambal-ayam-goreng-sauce-among-3-products-recalled-sfa-undeclared-allergens-2923476,"SINGAPORE: Three products have been recalled by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) due to the presence of undeclared allergens.
They are ABC Sweet Soy Sauce, ABC Sambal Ayam Goreng Sauce and Fukutoku Seika Soft Cream Wafers, said SFA in a news release on Tuesday (Sep 6).
The two ABC products, which originated from Indonesia, were found to contain sulphur dioxide.
The recall affects all ABC Sweet Soy Sauce imported by New Intention Trading, with an expiry date of Jun 26, 2024. 
The ABC Sambal Ayam Goreng Sauce is imported by Arklife Distributors and has an expiry date of Jan 6, 2024. SFA also detected in it the presence of benzoic acid, which was not declared on the food packaging labels.
However, SFA added that the levels of sulphur dioxide and benzoic acid detected fall within the limit permitted in sauce.

Fukutoku Seika Soft Cream Wafers, which originated from Japan, was found to contain undeclared egg white and wheat flour allergens. 
The affected batch is imported by Sinhua Hock Kee Trading, and comes with an expiry date of Apr 20, 2023.
""Allergen in food could result in an allergic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to it,"" said SFA. 
Under Singapore's food regulations, food products containing ingredients that are known to cause hypersensitivity must be declared on food packaging labels.
All ingredients in prepacked food should also be specified on the product label in descending order of the proportions by weight. 
The agency added that the presence of sulphur dioxide, egg white and wheat flour allergens does not pose a food safety issue to consumers at large, except for those who are allergic to them.
""Consumers who have purchased the affected product, and who are allergic to the allergens, should not consume it,"" said SFA. ""Consumers may contact their point of purchase for enquiries.""
The recalls are ongoing."
PM Lee congratulates new British leader Liz Truss on her appointment,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-congratulates-new-uk-leader-liz-truss-2923436,"SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday (Sep 6) congratulated new British Prime Minister Liz Truss after she was appointed to the role.
Ms Truss was invited to form a new government by Queen Elizabeth II a day after the former foreign secretary won a Conservative Party leadership vote. She succeeded Mr Boris Johnson, who tendered his resignation to the queen earlier on Tuesday.
“On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend my warmest congratulations on your appointment as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,” Mr Lee said in a letter.
“Your premiership comes at a time of significant challenges, as well as opportunities in an uncertain global environment.”
Mr Lee reflected on Singapore-UK ties and acknowledged Ms Truss’ involvement in a recent agreement between the two countries.
“The fundamentals of our bilateral relationship remain strong. Singapore and the United Kingdom share strong historical ties, with warm people-to-people links. We cooperate robustly across many sectors including trade and investment, security and defence, and in research and innovation,” Mr Lee wrote.
“Singapore reaffirms our commitment to the mutually beneficial economic partnership through the United Kingdom-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which you signed in December 2020 in Singapore.”
Mr Lee also highlighted new areas of bilateral cooperation, such as cyber security and the digital economy.
“The United Kingdom-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement is a milestone for both countries and unlocks new growth prospects for our businesses,” he wrote.
“I am also glad our officials have begun work on a framework for green economy cooperation, which can create many opportunities for our peoples and businesses.”
Concluding his letter, Mr Lee noted that both Singapore and the UK are “staunch supporters of a rules-based multilateral order, and the need to uphold international law”, and expressed his confidence that the two countries would maintain the “strong momentum” in their bilateral relations.
“I look forward to continue working with you to strengthen our partnership for the future,” Mr Lee wrote. “I wish you good health and every success, and look forward to meeting you soon.”

Beach Road Army Market sellers worry new Lazada SAF store could put them out of business,"The Army Market has served as a rite of passage for generations of new recruits to the Singapore military. It now faces a new online challenger.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/beach-road-army-market-business-shops-sellers-saf-lazada-online-store-2923206,"SINGAPORE: For anyone who has served National Service, making the trek to Beach Road Army Market to get military gear would have been a rite of passage.
But this may change for future generations after Tuesday's (Sep 6) launch of Lifestylemart, a new online store stocking selected Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) products on the Lazada platform.
Army Market stallholders who spoke to CNA on the same day as the launch expressed concern that this new e-commerce option would chip away at their business - which was already slowing before the COVID-19 pandemic.
When CNA visited the Market at lunchtime on a weekday, there were only a few customers milling about the shops. But stallholders said the marketplace was just as quiet on weekends.
Mr Jeffrey Yap has run Chop Chip Huat, a shop selling military attire and gear, for more than 30 years. The 70-year-old told CNA that business has been ""so-so"".
""We sell everything in order to survive. If you only sell army goods, you're dead,"" he said in Mandarin, adding that he was keeping the shop going to ""pass the days"".
Mr Yap mainly sells items to new recruits before their enlistment. He also caters to customers looking for items not available on SAF's eMart.

National servicemen receive credits which they can use to buy items from SAF's eMart, which has physical stores at various SAF camps as well as The Chevrons and SAFRA Punggol recreational clubs.
eMart credits cannot be used on the Lazada store, which currently stocks about 20 items including exercise attire, running shoes and camouflage face paint. More products will be added at a later stage.
Madam Lee, a stall assistant at the Army Market for almost 20 years, initially thought business had declined because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But she realised that the rise of e-commerce has also had an effect.
""See, as you walk around there are only a few customers. If Lazada sells (SAF products) online too we'll go out of business and have to close shop,"" she said in Mandarin.






      A shop at Beach Road Army Market, Sep 6, 2022.
    






Aside from military, exercise and outdoor gear, the Army Market also houses stalls that provide services such as the embroidery of names and ranks on military fatigues.
Madam Lim, who is in her 60s, is actually in the business of embroidering logos for restaurants and other businesses but majority of her customers come to her to personalise their military gear.
While such embroidery can also be done in-camp, some national servicemen approach her because of the faster turnover, said Mdm Lim.
She attributed business slowing at the marketplace to a lack of facilities such as escalators, lifts and parking spaces, making it less attractive to visitors.
Other stallholders however were more sanguine about their prospects.
Mr Soh Yian Teck, 60, has operated his Hoe Seng Teck Kee shop for almost 40 years. He expects sales to be minimally affected by the new Lazada store.
""We are small businesses, the main thing is that our expenses are low so we can keep going, no problem,"" he said.

Mr Soh added that customers tend to visit the Army Market when they need to procure an item immediately, as opposed to waiting for an online delivery to come through.
""We do our business, and they do their business,"" he said, referring to online stores.
""The times are always changing, there's no choice. Because now it's the digital age, we have to move with the times for our country and society to improve.""
While this reporter was speaking with Mr Soh, a customer approached with a photo of a pair of black boots on his phone screen.
The storeowner took one glance and said he did not stock the boots, but gave the customer the exact unit number of a shop that would have them.
Later, Mr Soh explained that the key thing was to provide convenience to customers, and to make sure that if they are looking for an item, they can find it at the Army Market.
Another customer, Mr Luven Ng, 23, told CNA he appreciated the environment at the market and the friendliness and honesty of stallholders.
He has been a regular at A.I.M. Spec, a shop selling imported tactical gear, for eight out of its nine years of operation.

The proprietor Sarah Quek, 44, said her aim was to differentiate her shop from others selling SAF wares.
Business for her was actually better during the pandemic and border closures, as customers could not go overseas to buy similar items.
Mr Ng, who is undergoing National Service in the Singapore Police Force, said he patronised the shop for reliable gear to use in his line of work, including equipment such as torchlights and gloves.
""I can find my things here,"" he said. ""I can depend on this place."""
"As Singapore undergoes leadership transition, it will keep finding ways to strengthen ties with Malaysia: Lawrence Wong","The relationship between the neighbouring countries will be even more important as both enter an emerging new global order, says Mr Lawrence Wong on his first official visit to Malaysia as Deputy Prime Minister. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-malaysia-singapore-official-visit-dpm-2923081,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore goes about its leadership transition, it will continue to find ways to strengthen its relationship with Malaysia, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Sep 6). 
Mr Wong was speaking at a doorstop interview with journalists in Kuala Lumpur, during his first official visit to Malaysia since being appointed as DPM in June.
This followed the April announcement of Mr Wong as leader of the ruling People's Action Party's fourth-generation team, paving the way for him to succeed Mr Lee Hsien Loong as Singapore's next Prime Minister.
Mr Wong said last month that no decision has been made on when he will take over the country's top job, but it could be before the next general election, which must be held no later than November 2025.
On Tuesday, he described Singapore and Malaysia as ""closest neighbours"" with ""very close cooperation"" and ""a high level of interdependency across many areas”.
“It is also a relationship that is underpinned by close people-to-people and family ties,” said Mr Wong, noting that his own father had grown up in Ipoh, Perak. 
“We will continue to find ways to strengthen this relationship as we go about our leadership transition in Singapore, that’s something that I would certainly like to do.” 
For example, Singapore has been looking at ways to strengthen connectivity with Malaysia, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
Most recently, the KTM train service has resumed, as well as ferry services between Desaru and Singapore's Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.
The Singapore–Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System, or RTS Link project, will also enable better connectivity between Singapore and Johor, he added. 
“These are some ongoing projects, but we certainly look forward to new areas of cooperation as well,” said Mr Wong.

Singapore open to fresh proposals from Malaysia on discontinued High-Speed Rail project, says Lawrence Wong













Responding to a question about fresh proposals for the discontinued Singapore-KL High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, Mr Wong said his discussion on the matter with Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri on Monday was a short one, and the two “didn’t get into great details” about the project. 
“Whatever has been done is done, we’ve closed that chapter, we look forward. And if there is interest on the Malaysian side now to revive the HSR project, let us have a fresh proposal to look at and we certainly will be very open to any new proposals,” said Mr Wong on Tuesday. 
“We are awaiting more details and when we see specifics, we will look at the proposal in detail and we will consider it and we can then proceed to have further discussions thereafter.” 
The HSR project, which aimed to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to about 90 minutes, was discontinued after multiple postponements at Malaysia's request. The agreement between the two countries eventually lapsed in December 2020.
Malaysia paid more than S$102 million in compensation to Singapore for the terminated project.
Mr Wong also spoke on Malaysia’s chicken exports to Singapore. 
Malaysia is “looking into it”, and considering “potentially at some stage when they are ready”, to resume their export of chicken to Singapore, he said. 
“No specific date has been given to me, but they are considering it, and they are looking at resuming exports soon. But in any case, within Singapore, I think we have already taken steps to diversify our imports for fresh chicken.” 
Singapore’s relationship with Malaysia will be even more important as both countries enter a new global environment with headwinds in the coming months, said Mr Wong. 
“We can anticipate issues with energy, food, economic slowdown, inflation, these are near term challenges. But more fundamentally, I think we also know that we are entering a new global order,” he added. 
“The golden age of globalisation that we all enjoyed in the past 30 years is probably over, and we are entering a new order, which will be characterised by greater geopolitical contestation and potentially more fragmentation in the global economy.” 
Countries like Singapore and Malaysia will continue to be pulled in different directions and there will be pressure to take sides, said Mr Wong. 
“Which is why it is vital for us to stand united and to stand together and to continue to strengthen our cooperation with one another.”"
"2 public entertainment outlets on Middle Road suspected of providing hostessing services, 31 people arrested",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/31-arrested-public-entertainment-outlets-middle-road-hostessing-service-police-2923036,"SINGAPORE: Two public entertainment outlets along Middle Road were found to have allegedly provided hostessing services during an enforcement operation on Saturday (Sep 3), resulting in 31 people arrested.
Twenty-nine women were suspected of providing hostessing services, and they were arrested for working without a valid work permit, said police in a news release on Tuesday. They were aged between 20 and 33.
Two men, 31 and 35, were arrested for offences related to the employment of foreign manpower.
“The two outlets, which allegedly provided hostessing services within their premises, were found to have contravened the Public Entertainment Act 1958,” said the police. The two outlets were not named in the news release.
Anyone who provides or assists in providing any public entertainment in contravention of the Act can be fined up to S$10,000.
Those found employing a foreign employee without a valid work pass face a fine of between S$5,000 and S$30,000, a jail term of up to 12 months, or both.

Travelling overseas? 7 destinations in Asia that have eased COVID-19 entry rules ,"Are COVID-19 tests and quarantine still needed? Here's a look at the requirements across key Asian destinations, including Japan and South Korea.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-entry-requirements-tourists-travellers-asia-south-korea-japan-taiwan-malaysia-2922606,"SINGAPORE: Destinations around the world have been easing COVID-19 entry restrictions as the pandemic wanes, with Japan, Taiwan and South Korea among the latest to announce relaxed rules.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Thursday (Sep 22) that his country will lift tough restrictions on foreign tourists, reopening its borders after two-and-a-half years.
As travel picks up, here's a look at the updated entry rules for some key Asian destinations.
JAPAN
From Oct 11, Japan will restore individual tourism and visa-waiver travel to people from certain countries as long as they are vaccinated against COVID-19.
At the same time, it will also scrap a daily cap on arrivals, currently set at 50,000.
Japan had maintained some of the strictest border measures among major economies, effectively blocking entry to visitors for two years until it began a gradual reopening in June.
But only about 8,000 people arrived in July, compared with more than 80,000 visitors a day before the pandemic.
Ahead of the Oct 11 reopening, tourists can visit Japan on package tours without a guide. This has been allowed since Sep 7.
Pre-departure tests were required for all travellers. But since Sep 7, all arrivals, including Japanese nationals, have been exempt from submitting proof of a negative COVID-19 test if they have received their third vaccine shot.
On-arrival tests and quarantine may be needed depending on where a visitor is travelling from.
For instance, countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, the United States, the United Kingdom and France, are on Japan's blue list - meaning on arrival tests and quarantine will not be required. There is also no need to submit a COVID-19 vaccination certificate.
Travellers from countries on the yellow list - for instance, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Portugal - need to quarantine for three days if they do not have a valid vaccination certificate.

TAIWAN
The Taiwan government confirmed on Sep 29 that it will end its mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for arrivals from Oct 13.
Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng previously said that visa-free entry would resume from Sep 29 for citizens of all countries that previously had that status.
The government will also increase weekly arrival limits for international travellers by 10,000 to 60,000, he said on Sep 22, with no more polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for arrivals. The arrival cap will be raised further to 150,000 a week with the end of mandatory quarantine, Lo said at the time.
In his latest statement on Sep 29, Lo said that with a well-vaccinated population and the pandemic under control at home, the time had come to reopen Taiwan's borders.
Arrivals will still need to monitor their health for a seven-day period and take rapid tests, but tourists will be allowed to return, he added.
Taiwan previously removed the requirement for negative pre-departure PCR tests. In June, it cut the number of days spent in isolation for arrivals from seven days to three.
SOUTH KOREA
If you're going to South Korea, you will soon no longer need to present a negative on-arrival PCR test within 24 hours of your arrival.
This will come into effect from Oct 1, ending all COVID-19 restrictions on inbound travellers. 
South Korea had already removed the mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 testing requirement for inbound travellers in September.
All travellers, including children below the age of six, are required to register for Q-code before departure.
A QR code will then be issued to the traveller's email. This is valid for one-time entry, according to the Embassy of the Republic of Korea to Singapore.
Travellers eligible for visa-free entry must also register for the Korea Electronic Travel Authorisation, or K-ETA, if they are visiting for fewer than 90 days. 
The country also lifted quarantine requirements for all travellers, regardless of vaccination status, from Jun 8.
HONG KONG
From Sep 26, hotel quarantine will no longer be required for international arrivals to Hong Kong. 
The territory on Sep 23 announced that it is scrapping the three-day hotel quarantine requirement, ending travel curbs that have kept the finance hub globally isolated for the past two-and-a-half years. 
Travellers arriving from overseas will be able to return home or to their accommodation and they will have to self-monitor for three days after entering Hong Kong.
During this three-day period, they will be allowed to go to work or school but will not be allowed to enter bars or restaurants.
A pre-flight PCR test which was required for travellers to Hong Kong 48 hours before flying will be replaced by a rapid antigen test.
Upon arrival, travellers will be subject to PCR tests. Overseas arrivals will also need further PCR tests on days two, four and six in the city.
Tourists who test positive for COVID-19 face being isolated in hotel rooms at their own expense. 
Hong Kong's pandemic rules will continue to stay in place, including social distancing restrictions, mandatory mask wearing and digital health codes to enter public venues.
Group gatherings of more than four people in public remain banned.

CNA Explains: Travelling to Hong Kong under its new quarantine rules? Here's what you need to know













SINGAPORE
From Aug 29, non-fully vaccinated short-term visitors aged 13 and above travelling to Singapore no longer need to apply for entry approval. 
They are not required to undergo a seven-day stay-home notice upon arrival or take a PCR test at the end of the stay-home notice period, the Health Ministry said, pointing to the improving local and global COVID-19 situation.
However, travellers who are not fully vaccinated must still present a negative pre-departure test within two days before departing for Singapore. They must also buy COVID-19 travel insurance to cover the duration of their stay.
All travellers entering Singapore via air or sea must submit their electronic health declaration before they enter Singapore, using the SG Arrival Card e-service up to three days before arrival.
MALAYSIA
All travellers are allowed to enter Malaysia regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status and do not require a pre-departure or on-arrival COVID-19 test, from Aug 1.
They will no longer need to fill in the traveller's card in the MySejahtera mobile application.
Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said authorities will step up the monitoring of travellers' health symptoms at all international entry points in Malaysia.
All travellers who have just arrived from overseas should self-monitor their health, comply with the standard operating procedures and are advised to go to a health facility if they are unwell, added Mr Khairy. 
THAILAND
Travellers are no longer required to apply for Thailand Pass, which was an online platform to submit documents before entry to Thailand.
At the point of entry to Thailand, travellers will only need to show proof of either a certificate of vaccination.
Those who are not fully vaccinated need to show a negative PCR test result or a professionally administered ART result.
If these requirements are met, there is no need to quarantine.

"Strong demand for larger flats in August BTO exercise, with Tampines units most popular",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/strong-demand-larger-flats-august-bto-exercise-tampines-units-most-popular-2922621,"SINGAPORE: Built-to-Order (BTO) flats in the mature estate of Tampines were the most popular in the August BTO exercise, with strong demand for larger five-room flats.
The latest BTO exercise closed at 11.59pm on Monday (Sep 5), with the final numbers updated on Tuesday afternoon. Seven projects were on offer in mature towns Tampines, Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah, and non-mature estates Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East and Woodlands. 
MATURE ESTATES
Five-room flats in Tampines were among the most popular this year, with 3,082 applicants for 117 flats. That means there were overall more than 26 applicants for each flat.
Only a four-room flat in Dakota Crest in Geylang, which was launched in February, was more popular this year.
Four-room flats in Tampines in the August BTO exercise also drew many applications, with 3,347 applicants for 150 such flats. 
In mature estates, at least 95 per cent of BTO supply is set aside for first-time families.
Units in Central Weave @ Ang Mo Kio were also in-demand. The four-room, five-room and 3Gen flats drew more than eight potential first-time buyers for each unit.

Two Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) projects in Bukit Merah - Alexandra Vale and Havelock Hillside - had more than 8,800 applicants for 1,651 units.
PLH flats have more stringent resale criteria, including a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP). After the MOP, they can only be sold to buyers who meet prevailing BTO eligibility conditions, such as the income ceiling.
As PLH flats are priced with additional subsidies, buyers of flats at Havelock Hillside and Alexandra Vale have to return 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation to HDB.

NON-MATURE ESTATES
In non-mature estates, four-room flats at Woodlands South Plains also drew strong demand. There were 11.7 applicants per four-room flat and 8.1 applicants per three-room flat.
In Jurong East, each four-room flat drew 6.7 applicants and there were 4.1 applicants per three-room flat. 
There were about 39,000 applicants in this exercise, which is about 46 per cent more than the applications in May's BTO exercise. HDB launched 4,993 BTO flats in August, compared to the 4,583 BTO flats in May.
""More buyers may have turned to the BTO market as prices of BTO flats are much more affordable than resale homes and private condominiums now,"" said Ms Christine Sun, OrangTee and Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics.
""There are also more units launched this time compared to the May BTO exercise. Many of these flats are in good locations, that is mature estates and near MRT stations.""

She said that demand is stronger in Ang Mo Kio and Tampines because these places are in mature estates. The Tampines project has one of the shortest completion periods - about 36 months - and is set to be ready by the second quarter of 2026.
""We noticed that five-room flats are very popular among buyers this time around. This could be due to fewer new five-room flats released in mature estates in recent launches.""
Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst at One Global Group, said that Sun Plaza Spring in Tampines had the lowest number of flats offered in this BTO exercise. 
""As a result, given the reduced number of units and the growing need for larger spaces, strong competition was seen for these flats,"" he said.
He said that the application rates for Alexandra Vale and Havelock Hillside appeared ""lacklustre"", possibly because of the longer MOP and longer completion rates for these projects.
""It is likely potential home applicants and younger couples looking for a shorter wait to occupy their flats, might have shifted their attention towards the other BTO flats that were offered.""
Mr Ismail Gafoor, CEO of PropNex Realty said that Woodlands South Plains likely stood out for applicants because of the project’s location – it is almost at the doorstep of Woodlands South MRT station. The pricing was affordable and it is close to the Woodlands Regional Centre, he added.
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) said that despite continued strong demand for BTO flats, first-timers have a good chance of securing a flat as the ""vast majority"" have been set aside for first-timer applicants.
From the August BTO exercise, more units in non-mature estates were set aside for first-time applicants. At least 95 per cent of four-room and larger flats are reserved for first-time families, and at least 85 per cent of three-room BTO flats are for first-time families.

HDB said on Monday that among the seven BTO projects launched, six projects had first-timer application rates of two or lower for one or more flat types.
""In particular, majority of first-timer applicants across the different flat types who applied for Keat Hong Grange project in Choa Chu Kang will have a good chance of securing a flat,"" said HDB.
This is because of the average 40 per cent rejection rate at the flat selection stage, and the ""relatively low"" first-time application rates across various flat types in non-mature estates.
The next BTO sales exercise is scheduled for November. HDB will offer about 9,500 BTO flats in towns and estates such as Bukit Batok, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Tengah and Yishun.
HDB aims to launch up to 23,000 new flats this year."
Man stopped by police for behaving suspiciously at train station jailed for having sex videos ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-obscene-videos-sex-women-transcom-court-train-station-2922746,"SINGAPORE: A man stopped by police officers for behaving suspiciously at a train platform was later revealed to possess illegally obtained videos of himself having sex with women.
Malaysian Khoo Ee Seong, 29, was sentenced on Tuesday (Sep 6) to 20 weeks' jail and a fine of S$4,000.
He pleaded guilty to four counts of intruding on a woman's privacy with intention to insult her modesty and one charge of possessing obscene films. Another 10 charges were considered in sentencing.
The court heard that Khoo was at the platform of Paya Lebar MRT Station on the afternoon of Feb 10, 2019, when officers attached to the Transcom Patrol Unit spotted him behaving suspiciously.
They approached Khoo and checked his belongings. They found videos of Khoo having sex with an unknown woman in his two phones, and they also found three thumb drives on Khoo.
Khoo admitted that there were obscene films stored in the drives, and he was arrested and his devices seized.
Forensic examination of Khoo's first phone uncovered five videos of him having sex with different women. He had paid a woman for sex with him at his flat at about 2.45am on Jul 12, 2017.
He placed his phone in a corner of the room with the video-recording mode on before the woman arrived and filmed her having sex with him without her knowledge.
Another video of Khoo having sex with a woman was found on his other phone. He paid this woman for sex with him at her flat at about 5.30pm on Jan 2, 2019, and again set up his phone to record the encounter without her knowledge.
The first of Khoo's thumb drives contained videos of him having sex with two other women in the same manner, while the remaining three thumb drives contained eight obscene films.
He had downloaded these films from pornography websites and saved them for personal viewing. One of them was more than 46 minutes long.
For intruding on a woman's privacy with intention to insult her modesty, he could have been jailed up to a year and fined per charge. For possessing obscene films, he could have been fined S$500 per film with a cap of S$20,000, jailed up to six months, or both."
"Former ITE lecturer jailed for taking upskirt shots on campus, had 133 illicit photos",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/upskirt-ite-lecturer-campus-jail-student-2922646,"SINGAPORE: A former lecturer with the Institute of Technical Education was jailed for four months on Tuesday (Sep 6) for taking multiple upskirt photos and videos on campus.
The 48-year-old man's victims included students and a female target in the cafeteria of an Institution of Technical Education.
A gag order was imposed barring the publication of any information that might identify the victims.
The man pleaded guilty to two counts of insulting a woman's modesty and a third charge of attempting to insult a woman's modesty. Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.
The court heard that the offender was working at an Institute of Technical Education at the time of the offences.
On Oct 25, 2019, he was teaching a Life Skills class when he spotted a student wearing a tight skirt revealing her legs. He selected her as his target and walked towards her with his phone camera switched on.
On the pretext of assisting her with her work, the man placed his phone at the edge of the table before taking several photos using the volume button on his phone.
When the class ended, he ensured no one was around and looked at the photos before realising he had failed to capture any images or videos of the student.
Meanwhile, the student had spotted the lecturer positioning his phone camera lens towards her skirt.
She immediately texted her father, sister and classmates, and her sister reported the matter to the police.
His phone was seized and at least 133 upskirt images and 17 videos were extracted from it.
Police investigations revealed the offender's modus operandi: He would look out for female students with short skirts around the school. He would also look out for female students who were ""sitting improperly in his lecture class"", court documents said.
He would then turn on the camera function on his phone before approaching his target under the guise of teaching her. He would then photograph or record up the student's skirt and review the footage after the lesson was over.
By the accused's own estimates, he filmed such upskirt videos and photos over the course of four to five months at a frequency of once a fortnight.
He took an upskirt photo and video of an unidentified female victim in the school cafeteria on Jun 5, 2019, and an upskirt video of another victim at the school's general office on Jul 29, 2019.
The prosecutor asked for between four and six months' jail, saying that the offender had abused his position of trust and authority as a lecturer. He had a number of upskirt photos and videos, and committed the offences in a covert manner, she said.
For each charge of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined."
"1,600 foreign worker dormitories to be licensed under single law to raise standards, contain disease outbreaks","Currently, only 53 dormitories are licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/foreign-worker-dormitories-single-law-feda-contain-disease-outbreaks-2922571,"SINGAPORE: Foreign worker dormitories with fewer than 1,000 beds will soon be licensed under a single regulatory framework that will allow authorities to raise their operating standards and impose additional requirements to manage disease outbreaks.
Such requirements include standing up additional isolation facility capacity and putting in place additional infection prevention and control measures, such as using personal protection equipment and increasing the frequency of cleaning. 
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced on Tuesday (Sep 6) that it will expand the coverage of the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) from Apr 1 next year to include dormitories with seven or more beds. 
Currently, all dormitories are subjected to various requirements across different legislation, covering areas such as fire safety, living conditions, sanitary and public health requirements.
Only dormitories with 1,000 beds or more are licensed under FEDA, and are subject to additional requirements for public health and safety, as well as providing recreation and commercial facilities for residents.
In 2020, tens of thousands of migrant workers living in dormitories contracted COVID-19. Last year, MOM announced that it would review FEDA to expand its coverage.
With the change, the number of dormitories licensed under FEDA will increase from 53 to 1,600, covering a total of 439,000 beds.

FOUR LICENCE CLASSES
Dormitories will fall under four licence classes depending on their size, with a set of essential living requirements such as minimum space per resident, maximum room occupancy, cleanliness and ventilation to be applied to all classes.
Dormitories with seven beds to 999 beds will be subject to new requirements in the areas such as reporting requirements, traffic management, and contingency plans for public health outbreaks.
Larger dormitories will also be subject to more stringent requirements on dormitory management, resident welfare and health and safety.
Those with 1,000 beds or more will not see any change in requirements as they are already licensed under FEDA. 
Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said on Tuesday that having different licence classes ensures that the requirements can be met by dormitories of different sizes.
Noting that smaller dormitories might have fewer resources, Dr Koh said MOM will work closely with stakeholders on the progressive implementation of FEDA over the next two years to minimise any disruption to dormitory operations.
In response to questions about why FEDA will only apply to dormitories with seven beds or more, MOM said this is aligned to the current occupancy cap of up to six unrelated people for public and private housing. 
It added that all dormitories with six or fewer residents are run by employers, who are regulated by the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. That Act sets out requirements to protect the well-being of workers, among other things.
Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited (DASL) council member Eugene Aw said factory-converted dormitories are likely to feel the biggest impact from the expansion of FEDA. 
“The challenge and what a lot of owner-operators are concerned (about) at this point in time is the potential increase in costs,” he said, adding that this is mainly administration costs. 
“However, after discussions with relevant government authorities, we are of the view that it is manageable and the expansion of FEDA at this point in time pertains mainly to a lot of improvements in terms of management.”
DASL said it will support the industry in adjusting to the new requirements through active engagements and training programmes.
It added that it is working closely with MOM to curate a training programme on compliance requirements and dormitory management best practices."
Societies cannot survive without the social glue that bonds people together: President Halimah ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/halimah-yacob-societies-social-glue-bonds-cohesion-2921561,"SINGAPORE: Societies cannot survive, let alone thrive, without the social glue that bonds people together, said President Halimah Yacob on Tuesday (Sep 6) at the International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS).
In her opening address at the second edition of the global interfaith event, she noted that the pandemic - and how it has deepened fault lines across the world - serves as a reminder that social cohesion is a necessary condition for collective security. 
""National resilience and stability are the result of people working together towards a common cause, united in the face of challenges and threats facing a country,"" she added. 
""Cohesive societies do not exist spontaneously. They are borne of choice and conviction. The pandemic has reinforced this.""
It was Mdm Halimah who first came up with the idea for a gathering to discuss faith, identity and cohesion back in 2018.
The inaugural ICCS, organised by the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) think-tank and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), took place in June 2019.
This year's conference will be held at Raffles City Convention Centre from Tuesday to Thursday and attended by more than 800 participants from close to 40 countries, including religious leaders, policymakers and civil society practitioners.
Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is expected to speak on the last day.
ICCS 2022 will examine the same issues as before but through the lens of lessons from the pandemic.
The pandemic was a public health crisis with serious social implications, said Mdm Halimah on Tuesday. 
""In a period of heightened social anxiety, tensions rose and in certain cases triggered hate, bigotry and xenophobia. This descended into violence in some places, with reports of hate crimes against persons of Asian ethnicity who were blamed for the spread of the virus,"" she said.

Emphasising the need to understand factors contributing to social cohesion, the president pointed to a regional study by the RSIS which found that 69 per cent of those surveyed in Southeast Asia believed that their country was socially cohesive. 
The study found that levels of trust and acceptance between people and the social networks they build over time are elements that help strengthen social cohesion, said Mdm Halimah. 
It also recommended that the engagement of community and religious leaders and other relevant stakeholders was critical to building cohesive societies. 
In view of these findings, initiatives like the Commitment to Safeguard Religious Harmony have become even more relevant, Mdm Halimah added. 
The initiative, launched at the first edition of the ICCS, saw religious leaders pledge to be united in promoting the common good, to stand against division and discord, and to build strong bonds across their communities through interactions such as attending each other’s festivals.
More than 750 of Singapore’s religious organisations have affirmed this Commitment, said Mdm Halimah.
""We face common challenges globally as we emerge from the pandemic,"" she said. ""We must continue to create and build safe and open platforms to discuss sensitive issues and work together to strengthen unity and resilience in our societies.""
Mdm Halimah added: ""This is a time to come together as a family, to recognise the beauty in our diversity and use that to our advantage in tackling greater challenges to come, so that we can build brighter and more cohesive societies for all."""
Selected SAF products now available online on Lazada,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lazada-saf-kit-buy-online-delivery-mou-nsmen-2922561,"SINGAPORE: National servicemen can buy selected Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) products online and get them delivered to their homes from Tuesday (Sep 6), with the launch of a new store on e-retailer Lazada.
The Lifestylemart store was launched after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Lazada and the Combat Service Support Command (CSSCOM), SAF's supply support arm.
Personal equipment and items for yearly in-camp training can be purchased from the store, which currently stocks about 20 products.
These include exercise attire, running shoes, camouflage face paint, water bags and other items in the SAF kit. More items are expected to be available at a later stage, after the pilot phase.

Describing the Lazada platform as ""intuitive"", Brigadier-General Terry Tan, Commander of CSSCOM, said the e-store would support national servicemen by bringing them greater convenience.
The MOU will also open up opportunities for exchanges in e-commerce expertise, supply chain management strategies and sustainability initiatives, a press release by Lazada stated.
BG Tan said the opportunity to learn from industry best practices could enhance CSSCOM's peacetime and operational effectiveness.
""We want public-private collaboration to be a lot stronger,"" said BG Tan, adding that this was something learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""(It is) important for this private and public partnership to take place in peacetime so that when we need to better serve and help Singaporeans in crisis, in national emergencies, we are able to do it a little bit more (seamlessly),"" he said.
CSSCOM will continue exploring more collaborations with other e-commerce partners to offer greater purchasing flexibility to national servicemen, he added.
Lazada CEO Loh Wee Lee said that the company was proud to contribute to a positive NS experience, adding: ""Our national servicemen contribute precious time for their training to keep Singapore safe and sovereign.""
He told CNA that Lazada was happy to share its experience leveraging technology to digitalise the e-commerce experience, as CSSCOM also has similar supply chain operations.

"Singapore to trial integrated construction park at Jurong Port, housing key supply chain facilities","The first integrated construction park will begin operations by the end of 2022.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/integrated-construction-park-jurong-port-supply-chain-facilities-built-environment-bca-2922436,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's first integrated construction park, located at Jurong Port, will be operational from December 2022.
It will bring together key supply chain players in the construction industry, making it easier for them to collaborate, as well as share resources and facilities. These include storage yards and ready-mix concrete batching plants.
The integrated construction park is one of several initiatives that form part of a new Industry Transformation Map (ITM), announced by Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Sep 6).
Speaking at the opening of the International Built Environment Week, Mr Lee said that bringing the construction facilities together will lead to greater efficiencies when producing construction components. For example, raw materials like cement, sand and granite can be transported using conveyor systems instead of lorries.
This can also result in a more efficient and greener construction materials supply chain, said the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).
Mr Lee said that the concept will be trialled at Jurong Port before authorities consider replicating it in other locations.

Construction activity has returned to close to pre-COVID levels and the manpower situation has stabilised, Mr Lee said, noting that the BCA is on track to achieve its projected demand of S$27 billion to S$32 billion this year.
But the lessons from the pandemic have also prompted a review of how the industry can be transformed, Mr Lee said as he launched a refreshed Built Environment ITM.
""We are not starting from scratch. This refreshed BE ITM builds on the progress that we have made under the Construction ITM and our Facilities Management transformation plans,"" he said.
""But we will now do much more to integrate all of these efforts, and adopt a building lifecycle approach towards transformation.""
INTEGRATED DESIGN AND PLANNING
Before integrating construction facilities, the industry will be nudged to adopt integrated design and planning, as well as collaborative contracting practices.
The BCA will encourage greater adoption of Integrated Digital Delivery which allows for collaboration by stakeholders through digital platforms.
It will also push for a redesign of conventional contracts to motivate parties to work together, build trust and facilitate risk-sharing.
Seven agencies have identified nine upcoming public sector projects to pilot collaborative contracting, Mr Lee said.
The BCA is also targetting to increase the adoption of prefabricated buildings or Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) from 44 per cent currently to 70 per cent by 2025.
This means more off-site production will be done in a factory environment with greater adoption of automation, said BCA.
""We must do so. We aim to be less reliant on low-skilled foreign manpower, and really upskill, and up the value chain in construction technology,"" said Mr Lee.
""Our latest move is to require all large building projects to adopt DfMA technologies from April 2022.""
The ICPs will support this by allowing for more automation and robotics in the production of precast and PPVC (prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction) modules.
Mr Liam Wee Sin, co-chair for the Urban Systems Cluster of the Future Economy Council, told reporters that COVID-19 showed how the industry is vulnerable as it is highly dependent on migrant workers and low in productivity.
""With the lessons learned from COVID, we've moved a step further ... to address all the vulnerability of our industry, and how we can then move forward to rise to the challenges of being more resilient, to be more productive, and also to bring a new way in which we work collaboratively,"" said Mr Liam, who is the group chief executive of UOL.
SMART FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
Another key aspect of the ITM is for greater adoption of smart facilities management, which aims to integrate different aspects of building management by using technology.
Mr Lee said that 80 per cent of public buildings should adopt Smart FM by 2030. The BCA is setting a new target for 40 per cent of private buildings by gross floor area to adopt Smart FM by the same year.
He gave the example of Jewel at Changi Airport, which has complex operations as it is attached to one of the busiest airports in the world and has an indoor forest and waterfall.

""But Jewel’s maintenance team is kept lean and efficient through the integration of security, building maintenance and guest services through Certis’ integrated platform,"" said Mr Lee, adding that employees can monitor the status of all building facilities through the integrated platform.
He encouraged firms to apply for a grant, announced at the Ministry of National Development's Committee of Supply this year, to develop such capabilities.
Mr Lee said that the refreshed ITM aims to build a sector that is more productive and resilient, contributes to a more sustainable environment and possesses ""deep capabilities"".
Four projects that demonstrated high standards in sustainability, productivity and digitalisation were given the new Built Environment Transformation Award at the opening event.
The winners are Tampines condominium development The Tapestry, office building PSA Liveable City, Eunoia Junior College and JTC’s 1 and 7 North Coast developments in Woodlands North Coast."

Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, was originally charged in December 2020 with the murder of Ms Teo, who was 19 when she went missing.
He was earlier accused of murdering her between 1.39am and 7.20am on Jun 30, 2007 at a flat in Block 19, Marine Terrace with suspected accomplice Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large.
However, in June this year, Ahmad Danial was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge and released from remand.
He was given six new charges, all of which are in common intention with Mr Ragil, meaning they allegedly committed the offences together. 
The offences include depositing Ms Teo's corpse at the vicinity of Punggol Track 24 around Jun 30, 2007, misappropriating Ms Teo's handphone, Apple Macbook Pro and camera, as well as failing to report information about Ms Teo's death to the police.
The remaining offences are for giving false information to the police, fabricating false evidence by placing Ms Teo's phone in East Coast Park, and fabricating false evidence by making calls to Ms Teo's phone, leaving her voicemails and sending her messages on social media to create the false impression that both men believed Ms Teo was alive although they knew she was dead.
Ahmad Danial was set to plead guilty in July but the hearing was adjourned for both sides to resolve issues including the facts, sentencing and documentation. 
He will next return to court on Oct 14 to enter his guilty plea and is out on bail of S$20,000.
Those convicted of depositing a corpse can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$2,000 or both.
Anyone who fabricates false evidence can be jailed up to seven years or fined.
The punishment for misappropriating the property of a dead person is up to three years' jail and a fine.
The penalty for omitting to give information to public servants as required by the law is up to one month's jail and a fine of up to S$500.
Anyone who gives false information to a public servant can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$1,000 or both."
S$1b Envy Global fraud case: Lawyers for man accused of helping ex-director in escape bid discharge themselves,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/envy-global-fraud-case-1-billion-lawyers-discharged-2922431,"SINGAPORE: Lawyers representing a man accused of conspiring to help a businessman linked to a billion-dollar fraud case flee Singapore discharged themselves on Tuesday (Sep 6).
Shawn Liew Cheng Long, 36, failed to respond to his lawyers since the last court mention. On Tuesday morning, a warrant of arrest was issued for Liew when he did not show up in court.
But he turned up later that morning and explained that he was late. The arrest warrant was then withdrawn.
He was told to engage new lawyers by the next court mention and to return to court on Sep 27.
Liew was charged in July with one count of conspiring with another man to assist the former managing director of Envy Global Trading Ng Yu Zhi to leave Singapore illegally. This was when Ng was under investigation for criminal offences.
Liew is accused of engaging in a conspiracy with Ang Yew Teck around August 2021 to help Ng leave Singapore and obstruct the course of justice. He allegedly offered Ng plans to leave the country.
Ang was given a similar charge in February and faces other offences including illegal gambling acts.
The police previously said in a statement that this case is separate from another bid by three others to help Ng escape. All three have been sentenced to jail.
Ng faces more than 100 charges, including cheating and criminal breach of trust. One of the charges is for dishonestly misappropriating at least S$201.2 million from Envy Global Trading's DBS bank account between August 2020 and February 2021.
His alleged victims include a criminal lawyer who was allegedly cheated in an arrangement involving more than S$1 million between October 2020 and January 2021, as well as a woman listed as general counsel on Temasek's website. 
She was allegedly cheated into giving S$5.5 million to Envy Global Trading for four receivables purchase agreements between October 2020 and January 2021.
Ng is also accused of cheating a former president of the Law Society of Singapore of about S$87,000 between October 2020 and December 2020.
Ng is next set to return to court for a pre-trial conference in October."
IN FOCUS: Are Singapore’s youth fighting more - or simply filming more acts of violence?,"After a video went viral of a group of girls attacking another in a carpark, CNA looks at whether social media has had a role in fanning the flames of violent and aggressive acts among young people. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/youth-violence-fighting-bullying-young-brawling-social-media-2917921,"SINGAPORE: Punched, kicked, dragged by her hair and flung multiple times to the floor of a car park, the girl cries out in distress.
But her tormentors - three 15-year-old girls - offer only mocking laughs in return, and continue raining blows on their victim in a viral clip circulating in August.
The same month, another video spreads online like wildfire, this time of a St Andrew's Secondary School student aggressively confronting a school staff member and screaming threats such as ""I'll end your life right now"".
More clips later emerge on social media, showing who appears to be the same boy scrapping with other students in a school toilet and along a corridor, fully aware they are being filmed as others also stand around watching. 
In May, footage of international school students tussling at a void deck - complete with boxing gloves - and in the company of at least 10 onlookers, draws the attention of online crowds and subsequently, the police.
These videos, along with several others of youth in brawls and free-for-alls, have racked up hundreds of thousands of shares, reposts and reactions to the shocking scenes on display.
They are only the latest servings in a buffet of disconcerting imagery to consume and regurgitate at the tap of a button - and they have sparked heated debate.

Several lament a perceived upswing in aggression and violence among youth, asking if social media platforms should be held accountable for hosting and perhaps even enabling these trends.
 
Public data - along with observations by social workers, educators, behavioural experts and people who engaged in fights themselves - show a mixed picture of whether youth in Singapore are partaking in more violence these days.
 
Some tell CNA that the more pressing issue is that of bullying, which often goes undiscovered.
 
But all agree that it is worth exploring if social media has fanned the flames and perpetuated, among the young, an increasingly visible spectacle of violence.

""IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION""
Police statistics show that the number of people aged 21 and below arrested for rioting has steadily dropped over the last decade, from 462 cases in 2011 to 150 in 2020.











It reflects efforts by the police to clamp down on organised crime - in recent times, multiple operations against gang activities have been conducted, and those arrested included individuals below the age of 21 - with some as young as 16.
“In the 80s, in the 90s, when you see the gangs fight - (they were) very violent. I think the intensity was higher,” said Mr Ong Teck Chye, the assistant director of residential and outreach services at the Boys’ Town charity, which helps children and youth in need. 
 
“Is there really more violence (now)? Everybody's always saying that every generation that follows is worse, right?”
 
Figures from the police also reveal, however, that the number of those aged 21 and below arrested for causing serious hurt rose from 62 cases in 2011 to 77 in 2020.











For some observers, this suggests a shift away from mass brawls toward settling disputes one-to-one or in smaller groups.
 
Men who participated in fights in their youth told CNA it could also be a case of violence becoming more visible – and in part motivated by a pursuit of online clout.
 
Their names have been changed to avoid identification.
 
“I believe fights have always happened, but people just didn’t video them as much and subsequently, didn’t post them online,” said Charles, who began brawling at the age of 19. 
 
“The rise of awareness of such incidents shouldn’t be attributed to more incidents, but to our access to online content.”
 
He said it is possible that fights are filmed and uploaded – sometimes by aggressors themselves - to pressure, blackmail or embarrass their victims, or gain a reputation.






      Screengrabs of a video circulating on social media of a girl being beaten up in a car park.
    






Social worker Wong Ying Li, who heads the youth and community mental health departments at social service agency Fei Yue, agreed.
 
""Attention via notoriety could be a motivating factor,"" she said.
“For those who upload videos - and they may not be the youth who were involved in the physically violent behaviour - social media provides immediate gratification and it meets the youth’s need for recognition and achievement.”
""I’M NOT SO DUMB""
Sociologist Omer Ali Saifudeen from the Singapore University of Social Sciences notes that such behaviour takes place against the backdrop of an already “readily available” spectacle of violence online.
He cites the likes of terrorist Brenton Tarrant, who in 2019 livestreamed his murder of 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand.
People grow increasingly desensitised and there is the danger that this “sets the standards in terms of the norms and values of what is okay”, said Dr Omer.
Layered onto an appetite for capturing and spreading incidents of violence in hopes of gaining virality, the act takes on a life of its own, with an added dimension of “broadcasting” power over a victim.
“So the next time you feel someone needs to be taught a lesson you film it, and you’ll be celebrated for it … That kind of messaging is going up,” Dr Omer added.
“We never quite got past our own schadenfreude. We never quite got out of the Colosseum,” said the lecturer.
He was referring to the historic Roman amphitheatre notorious for its gladiatorial contests and other public spectacles.
CNA asked tech firms Twitter, TikTok and Meta – parent of Facebook and Instagram - for information and statistics relating to content on their platforms featuring youth violence. All declined to comment.

Commentary: What’s behind young people’s violent behaviour?



















More youths seeking help with mental health - but finding it isn’t always easy













Ms Adrienne Sng, a clinical psychologist at Boys’ Town, said, however, that her research shows no proof of social media leading to violent behaviour.
 
When exposed to violent content on platforms, youth may realise the possibility of behaving in such ways or become more accepting or tolerant of violence as a part of life. 
 
But the youth that she works with rarely emulate what they see online, said Ms Sng, and in fact speak of such acts almost derisively – such as by insisting “I’m not so dumb”.
 
Former and current teachers told CNA that the real problem, instead, is an “observable” increase in the number of students being bullied, threatened, ostracised or ridiculed by schoolmates – with many of these going unreported.
POWER IMBALANCES
Last year, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling revealed that in 2020, there were two bullying incidents for every 1,000 primary school students, and five bullying incidents for every 1,000 secondary school students. The proportions were the same in 2019, but exact figures were not provided.
The education and social and family development ministries did not immediately respond to CNA’s requests for comment and for the latest data.
A 2018 study by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) found that 26 per cent of students in Singapore reported being bullied at least a few times a month - on par with levels in the United States.
Ms Sng described bullying as a subset of youth violence, and involving a constellation of behaviours: It is unwarranted, has intention to harm, is repeatedly performed over a period of time and involves a power imbalance in interpersonal relationships.
The August video of teenage girls scuffling in the car park also led to some comments saying that this was a clear case of bullying.






      Screengrabs of videos circulating on social media of an assault on a girl by three other teenagers at the multi-storey car park of Block 269 Compassvale Link.
    






Dr Omer believes bullying should not be considered distinct from violence.
He said it is an embodiment of “cultural violence” - where someone is considered “less acceptable” or as needing to be put down, by another person with their own sense of superiority.
“This is how violence is escalated,” he said in response to the video of the girls in the car park. 
“You start with something small, verbal, and then you get away with it. (Then) you push the envelope a little bit more because you’re emboldened.”
How then can a young person be steered away from a path of violence? One commonly found suggestion among online reactions: Cane them if need be.
Dr Omer said caning might have had a deterrent effect when its use was more normalised. “It does have that kind of immediate terror …  It’s the easiest thing to turn to,” he noted. 
But there will always be those who keep receiving corporal punishment and never improve.
“They carry that resentment forward, it never quite gets resolved, and you see recidivism happening,” said Dr Omer. “There's no easy answer.”

Bullying not acceptable and has no place in schools: Ministry of Education













TACKLING TRIGGERS
Ms Wong from Fei Yue said that from a youth social worker’s perspective, all parties involved in violent or bullying behaviour – whether aggressor or victim - are viewed as in need of support and intervention.
Having such incidents published and propagated widely can be unhelpful for all parties, she added.
“They may be shamed or even glorified at times by their act. The former affects their mental well-being while the latter internalises their negative identities and perpetuates the behaviour,” said Ms Wong, recommending that people refrain from sharing videos of violent acts.
Observers said however that it would be a tall order to tear youth away from their screens – and could even backfire. Attempting to police uploads of violent videos could also end up diverting their attention and energies in other questionable directions.
Max, who started getting into dust-ups with others at the age of 11, said that social media can also function as a deterrent.
“Youth who are more aware of their surroundings may stop acts of bullying upon being recorded, to not have evidence against them,” he said.
“And with technology these days, it’s also easier to identify victims and the bullies.”

Ms Sng from Boys’ Town points to an entire ecosystem in place – schools, youth groups and media platforms offering education and mental health strategies – working to encourage positive youth development instead.
“Youth need to know they are supported, have resources and can have positive experiences growing up,” she said.
This would then form a protective net to catch, early on, any underlying factors that could lead to violent behaviour - including neglect, abuse, or even a genetic disposition towards aggression.
A former educator who wanted to be known only as Peter agreed.
“No child is capable of hurt unless provoked by some emotional or mental triggers,” he said.
Parents, on their part, must not allow underlying triggers to go unresolved, whether by denying their children proper attention or not acknowledging their own overprotectiveness.
“The younger generation … they want people to understand them,” said Peter. “It’s vital that we show care and the human touch to (them) so that they learn respect and empathy for their peers.”
“These are lessons which can only be taught by human interaction, care and attention - and cannot be taught through technology.”"
"Singapore open to fresh proposals from Malaysia on discontinued High-Speed Rail project, says Lawrence Wong",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-ismail-sabri-yaakob-high-speed-rail-hsr-kuala-lumpur-malaysia-2921681,"SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Sep 5) told Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob that Singapore is open to fresh proposals from Malaysia on the terminated Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High-Speed Rail (HSR) project.
Mr Wong also noted Malaysia's interest in reviving discussions on the project - echoing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's comments after he met his counterpart Mr Ismail Sabri during the Malaysian premier's first official visit to Singapore in November last year.
Mr Wong, who is also Singapore's Finance Minister, is on his first official visit to Malaysia since being appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in June.
The HSR project, which aimed to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to about 90 minutes, was discontinued after multiple postponements at Malaysia's request and an eventual lapsing of an agreement in December 2020.
Malaysia paid more than S$102 million in compensation to Singapore for the terminated project.
On Monday, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a release that Mr Wong had called on Mr Ismail Sabri and the two ""reaffirmed the substantive and broad-based cooperation shared by Malaysia and Singapore"".
Both welcomed the ""good"" progress made on the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Project, which is slated to start service at the end of 2026.
Mr Wong then reiterated Mr Lee's invitation to Mr Ismail Sabri to visit Singapore for the 10th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders’ Retreat, said the PMO.
""Prime Minister Ismail Sabri and Deputy Prime Minister Wong looked forward to Singapore and Malaysia working together for the continued mutual benefit of both countries, including in new areas of cooperation in green and digital economies,"" the release added.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also said in a separate release on Monday that Mr Wong was hosted to dinner on Sunday by his Malaysian finance minister counterpart Tengku Zafrul Aziz.
They exchanged views on the challenges and opportunities for Singapore and Malaysia in the face of global economic headwinds and geopolitical developments, said MOF.
On Monday, Mr Wong met the governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus.
""They discussed how Singapore and Malaysia can strengthen financial cooperation in many areas, including sustainable finance, cross-border digital payments, combatting scams, and regional financial stability,"" MOF said in its release.
Mr Wong also inspected the Malaysian Defence Ministry's Guard of Honour, and later met Malaysian Senior Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein.
MOF said they discussed ways to further enhance cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia, as well as within ASEAN.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/philippine-president-ferdinand-marcos-jr-state-visit-singapore-orchid-2921536,"SINGAPORE: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will make a state visit to Singapore from Tuesday (Sep 6) to Wednesday at the invitation of Singapore's President Halimah Yacob. 
Mr Marcos will be accompanied by his wife, First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos, as well as Cabinet secretaries and senior officials, said Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Monday. 
This is Mr Marcos' first state visit to Singapore. The last Philippine president to visit Singapore was former president Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. 
During their visit, the president and his wife will have a new orchid hybrid, the Dendrobium Ferdinand Louise Marcos, named in their honour. 
They will receive a ceremonial welcome at the Istana and call on Mdm Halimah, who will host a state lunch in their honour. 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will also call on and host the Philippine president to breakfast. 
Mr Marcos and Mr Lee will jointly witness the exchange of bilateral agreements that will further strengthen cooperation in several areas, including counter-terrorism and data privacy, said MFA in a press statement. 
Earlier today, Mr Marcos met with Indonesia's President Joko Widodo in Jakarta for a state visit focused on bolstering defence, trade and other ties between the two neighbours. This is Mr Marcos' first overseas trip as president. 
Mr Marcos, who is also known by his nickname Bongbong, won the presidential election in May and took office on Jun 30, succeeding Mr Duterte. 
In her letter in May congratulating Mr Marcos Jr on his election win, Mdm Halimah also invited him to visit Singapore. 
“Singapore and the Philippines share a warm and longstanding relationship, underpinned by strong economic cooperation and robust people-to-people ties,” she wrote in the letter dated May 14.
Mr Lee said in a separate letter then that Mr Marcos' win showed the strong support from the Filipinos in his leadership and vision for the country.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged in his letter the ""deep and longstanding"" ties between Singapore and the Philippines in many domains including labour, trade and defence. 
""I look forward to continuing our close cooperation for the benefit of our countries, peoples and the region,"" he added."
PUB distributes flood barriers to residents amid rainy season after Clementi landslide,"The flood protection devices can be set up quickly during heavy rain to prevent water from entering homes, says PUB.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pub-flood-protection-barriers-clementi-landslide-sunset-way-sunset-drive-rain-wet-weather-2921551,"SINGAPORE: National water agency PUB distributed flood barriers and inflatable floodbags to residents at Sunset Way and Sunset Drive on Monday (Sep 5) as a precautionary measure, after Friday's landslide at a nearby construction site.
The landslide, which occured at the site of the Clementi NorthArc Build-to-Order project, caused ""soil displacement"" into Sungei Ulu Pandan and damaged part of the Ulu Pandan park connector.
Recovery works to stabilise the site and safely remove the dislodged soil in Sungei Ulu Pandan would take time, said PUB in a Facebook post on Monday.
“With rainy weather expected in the first half of September, the areas upstream of the canal blockage may experience higher flood risk in the event of heavy rain,” it added.
The flood barriers consist of individual lightweight panels that can be linked up and deployed quickly to divert floodwaters, said PUB, while the floodbags inflate upon contact with water and can be stacked up to form a barrier.
“These flood protection devices can be set up quickly during heavy rain, to prevent floodwaters from entering homes,” said the agency, adding that it has also reached out to building owners in the area to assist them with flood protection.

PUB said it has also put more quick response team vehicles on standby at the upstream locations, so they can respond to potential flash floods and provide assistance.
“We are also closely monitoring the rain forecast and water level sensors in the canal, and will support NParks to close the Ulu Pandan Park Connector for public safety when necessary,” it added.
The agency also reminded members of the public to avoid using the park connector during heavy rain, remain on high ground and avoid walking through floodwaters in the event of a flash flood.
In a separate Facebook post on Monday, Member of Parliament for the area Sim Ann said: “Drainage has been progressively improved in the Sunset Way neighbourhood in recent years, but it is still one of the closest areas to the incident site.
“Of course we hope these devices won’t need to be used, but it is good to be prepared.""
On Sunday, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the recovery and construction efforts to repair the damage caused by the landslide ""may take a few months”.
This includes removing the dislodged soil in Sungei Ulu Pandan, reinstating the damaged part of the Ulu Pandan park connector and reconstructing the slope and retaining walls within the site.

Singaporeans invited to share views on education and lifelong learning in Forward Singapore exercise,"The Equip pillar of the Forward Singapore exercise will focus on exploring how to provide every Singaporean with the opportunity to thrive, grow and realise their aspirations regardless of their starting point in life. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/forward-singapore-equip-pillar-engagement-ministry-education-2921501,"SINGAPORE: Singaporeans are invited to share their views on education and lifelong learning as part of the Forward Singapore exercise.
Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing launched the Forward Singapore Equip pillar microsite on Monday (Sep 5) as he encouraged Singaporeans to give their feedback.
""One of the things that we want to see and have demonstrated here this evening is this. We didn't want this to be an exercise where we tell everyone else what we want to achieve and put a fullstop,"" said Mr Chan in his closing remarks after an engagement session with 74 students at Republic Polytechnic on Monday afternoon.
""What we want to see is we want an evolving document of what we all want to achieve together in common. And how we, each and every one of us, is going to contribute to that.""
The engagements under the Equip pillar will focus on building consensus and fostering collective responsibility on how to equip every Singaporean with the opportunity to ""thrive, grow and realise their aspirations"", regardless of their starting point in life, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a separate press release.
Mr Chan, Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad and Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and National Development Tan Kiat How will lead the Equip pillar of the Forward Singapore exercise.
The Forward Singapore exercise was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in June, with the aim of reviewing and refreshing Singapore's ""social compact"".

As part of the exercise, MOE will be engaging stakeholders such as leaders in schools and institutes of higher learning, educators, parents and students from August to November.
The engagements will focus on five key areas: A strong foundation for every child, diverse learning models for diverse abilities, multiple pathways of success, caring for students with special educational needs, and lifelong growth for everyone, said the ministry in the press release.
The sessions will conclude with a large-group engagement in mid-November with various stakeholders to consolidate the findings.
Mr Chan, Mr Zaqy and Mr Tan, alongside Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang, discussed with the students on Monday about what they hope to see in Singapore's education and lifelong learning landscape.
The Equip pillar aims to build consensus and listen to the aspirations of young people in Singapore, said Mr Zaqy, speaking to journalists after the session. 
""It's wonderful today to hear from our polytechnic kids in terms of their aspirations for Singapore ... what their perspectives are with regards to how the Government looks at policies that affect them. At the same time, what they would like to see changed in the future and how things could develop and evolve,"" he added.
In an interview on News Tonight on Monday, Mr Chan said that students and teachers recognise that academic success is not the only yardstick for success. 
""For example, many of them say that everyone is unique, and everyone has their own unique strengths and weakness,"" he added. 
""And one of the definitions of success for our education system is for us to be able to help each and everyone to realise their full potential and to do justice to their gifts."" 
This means Singapore must have multiple pathways to success, and different systems to ""bring out the best in everyone"", said the Education Minister. 
The education system will need more resources to support the diverse pathways, he noted. 
""If we take an example of what we call full subject-based banding versus streaming in the past. Streaming in the past wasn't wrong per se, but because it was a much more efficient system, but you may not cater to the diverse needs of all the students because all of them are benchmarked on a single matrix,"" he added. 
Full subject-based banding means students can take subjects at different levels according to their strengths and weaknesses. This requires more resources in terms of planning their timetables and putting them into appropriate groups, said Mr Chan. 
""But beyond the resources, I think we also need a change in the mindset, and we also need the support of the parents and the community,"" he added. 
""Because when we say that we recognise people's strengths and weaknesses beyond just the academic grades, then I think the industries need to play a role, the parents need to play a role."""
"Changi Airport Terminal 2 to resume departure operations on Oct 11, starting with Singapore Airlines flights","Singapore Airlines flights to Southeast Asian destinations, including Thailand and Malaysia, will depart from Changi Airport Terminal 2.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-airport-terminal-2-departure-flights-singapore-airlines-southeast-asia-2921451,"SINGAPORE: Changi Airport Terminal 2 will resume operations for departure flights on Oct 11, starting with Singapore Airlines (SIA) flights to Malaysia and Thailand.
SIA flights to other Southeast Asian destinations - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam - will depart from the southern wing of Terminal 2 from Oct 13.
Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced this on Monday (Sep 5) as part of the terminal's phased reopening. Arrival operations had resumed in May after a two-year closure due to upgrading works and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The commencement of departure operations at T2 will add to Changi’s capacity and spread out passenger operations more evenly across the airport’s terminals as travel demand continues to grow in the lead-up to the year-end travel peak,"" said CAG in a media release.
Two other airlines – Air India (AI) and Air India Express (IX) – will move to Terminal 2 on Oct 18, said CAG, adding that the list of other airlines using the terminal will be announced later.
As for SIA flights arriving at Changi Airport, they will continue to be assigned gates at Terminals 1, 2 or 3.
Those who are meeting travellers at the airport are advised to check the terminal assigned two hours before the estimated flight arrival time.

There will also be various food and beverage options and retail shops in the public and transit areas of the southern wing. These include a number of stores returning to their original locations before the terminal's upgrading, said CAG.
The terminal’s transit hotel and pay-per-use lounge will be open to departing and transit passengers. Eligible Singapore Airlines customers may use the SilverKris Lounge at the terminal.
“When the northern wing of T2 is fully completed by 2024, passengers can expect even more interesting F&B and retail options, as well as new attractions that will enhance their travel experience through Changi,” said CAG.
It added that it will conduct more operational readiness trials with airline and airport partners to ensure that all systems and processes are in place for a smooth opening of Terminal 2’s southern wing.
“With a refreshed design, upgraded systems and a high degree of automation across the passenger journey, T2 will enable Changi to serve our passengers better as we prepare for a busier year-end holiday peak,” said Mr Tan Lye Teck, CAG’s executive vice president of airport management.
He added that CAG will work closely with airline and airport partners to welcome more passengers at Terminal 2."
Banks in Singapore raise fixed deposit rates as demand surges for safe returns,"Rising interest rates may be bad news for those taking bank loans, but there is a flip side – rates are also higher now for people who are putting money into fixed deposits.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/banks-singapore-fixed-deposits-interest-rates-promotions-uob-ocbc-dbs-2920996,"SINGAPORE: Thinking of parking some money in a fixed deposit? Good news – as interest rates for both loans and savings accounts rise, fixed deposit rates are increasing too.
Several banks in Singapore have rolled out promotions, with this month’s rates going as high as 2.6 per cent for a 12-month fixed deposit and 2.7 per cent for 24 months.
Most lenders require minimum placements of S$20,000 for these promotional rates.
A fixed deposit, otherwise known as a time or term deposit, allows one to earn a guaranteed amount of interest for a lump sum of money deposited with a bank over a specified duration. Unlike regular savings accounts, customers cannot withdraw this money before the so-called “lock-in” duration is over. 
UOB has been among the more aggressive banks, adjusting its fixed-deposit promotions monthly and offering one of the highest rates across a variety of tenor options so far.
For September, the promotional rate for a 10-month fixed deposit is 2.4 per cent, up from last month’s 1.6 per cent. The 12-month rate is 2.6 per cent, likely the highest in town as of Monday (Sep 5) when CNA did a check across various banks.
UOB’s head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan said: “In the current uncertain market environment, we have seen more customers looking for safe havens to protect their wealth.""
Another local bank OCBC is offering 2.3 per cent for fixed deposits of 12 months, according to its latest promotional rate released over the weekend.
Changes to its promotions are done “in line with market conditions”, said the bank’s head of deposits Na Kok Peng. “We will continue to monitor the landscape and ensure our interest rates stay competitive.”
Among foreign lenders, RHB has upped its promotional rate for a 24-month fixed deposit to 2.7 per cent per annum from 2.3 per cent. Its 12-month promotion is going at 2.45 per cent, while a six-month deposit earning interest rates of 1.8 per cent is also available for those who prefer a shorter tenor.
Maybank has also rolled out new promotional rates for longer fixed deposit durations this month – 2.35 per cent per annum for an 18-month tenor and 2.4 per cent a year for 24 months. These come on top of existing promotional rates of 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent for 12 months and 15 months, respectively.
Such a variety caters to different customer preferences and needs, said a spokesperson who added that Maybank pays interest upfront by the next working day after the fixed deposits are placed.
“We have been receiving very positive response for our various fixed deposit promotion campaigns,” she told CNA.
Also having a promotion this month is Standard Chartered Bank, which is offering 1.8 per cent for a minimum of S$25,000 over 12 months.
The bank also offers a “sustainable” fixed deposit option, which is described as allowing customers to have their capital referenced against the bank’s sustainable loans and projects. This is also currently going at a promotional rate of 1.8 per cent for a 12-month tenor.
A spokesperson said the sustainable time deposit has been “well-received” since its launch in December 2020, with demand mostly from customers who “want to put their money in a purposeful investment to address long-term environmental challenges”.
DBS, Singapore’s largest bank, is the only bank that has not jumped on the bandwagon of promotions so far, but it told CNA that it remains the only bank to have raised board rates or general fixed deposit rates.
“Our Singapore dollar fixed deposits are popular particularly among small retail depositors, and our board rates remain competitive after the recent increase in June, the first amongst local banks,” said the bank’s head of consumer banking in Singapore Jeremy Soo.
“Nonetheless, we are continually reviewing our suite of initiatives and product offerings in order to help our customers to better withstand the inflationary environment across various aspects of their lives.”

Unsurprisingly as banks dole out juicy deals, demand for fixed deposits has gone up in recent months.
UOB said the bank’s fixed deposit portfolio has grown 16 per cent in the first seven months of this year, while OCBC said placements it received in August grew 60 per cent from July and nearly 150 per cent from June.
“With the rising interest rate environment, customers are seeking higher yields for their deposits, while with higher inflation, customers will see a bigger erosion of their cash value over time,” said OCBC's Mr Na.
“Hence, customers today need to make financial plans to outdo inflation over a longer time horizon – and naturally, demand for time deposits – especially the popular 12-month tenors – has increased.”
Likewise, Standard Chartered has observed a preference for 12-month fixed deposits, compared to longer terms such as 18 or 24 months in a rising interest rate environment.
Over at RHB, demand for fixed deposits has also been “strong” – up about 50 per cent since 2021, said Ms Coreen Kwan, its head of retail bank in Singapore.
“I believe in this volatile market environment, many customers will prefer liquidity to protect their savings. So it’s a win-win situation if they can earn higher interest on their savings while safekeeping their funds.”
WHAT SHOULD DEPOSITORS DO?
While swift increases in borrowing rates have dominated headlines in the previous months as major central banks tighten monetary policy, banks have started moving on the rates they pay on savings of late.
Interest rates for savings accounts got a boost last month, with DBS being the first mover among local banks.
Maybank, RHB and CIMB Bank have also raised the rates for their flagship savings accounts here in a bid to stay competitive.

CNA Explains: Why are Singapore Savings Bonds in hot demand and should you invest in them?













These revisions are part of a “natural progression with rising loan rates and inflation”, said Maybank Securities’ head of research in Singapore Thilan Wickramasinghe.
“Banks are looking to improve visibility of their cost of funds and duration amidst further expected interest rate hikes,” he said.
Foreign banks are usually more aggressive in jostling for deposits as their smaller deposit bases mean they need to balance liquidity and cost of funding visibility in a rising rate environment. But in light of the stiff competition, domestic banks, which enjoy a large pool of funds from domestic customers and seldom dole out attractive offers, also have to ramp up their game.
“The domestic banks have larger deposit bases however, they will also need to be nimble and respond to competition in order to defend market share,” Mr Wickramasinghe said.
For those mulling whether to take advantage of the promotional rates for fixed deposits, Providend’s senior client adviser Tan Chin Yu said fixed deposits can be useful for short-term needs. 
These include instances when an individual requires “a very high level of safety and cannot afford to have market volatility over a short period of time”, he explained.
But while the higher rates are attractive, Mr Tan recommends comparing fixed deposits with similar low-risk investment options such as the Singapore Savings Bonds.
The Singapore Savings Bonds, issued and fully backed by the Singapore Government, has garnered more attention this year with its steadily rising returns. The 10-year average return rose from just under 2 per cent in January to a record high of 3 per cent in August, although that has since dipped slightly for the bond’s subsequent tranches.
The October issue, for example, is offering a 10-year average return of 2.75 per cent, lower than September’s 2.8 per cent.
Financial experts like Mr Tan have described the Singapore Savings Bonds as “very attractive” due to merits such as flexibility and capital protection. 
That said, due to rising demand, investors may be unable to get the full amount they applied for. The quantity ceiling – applied when applications exceed the issuance size – for the September issue was S$13,000, up from August’s S$9,000 but still below the S$18,000 limit in July.
Given this limit in allotment, those looking to park large amounts of capital should consider other options, said Mr Tan.
Another key consideration for retail investors is the time horizon they have until the money is needed, as fixed deposits or bonds have varying tenor options. Early termination of fixed deposits usually means the depositor will get back only the principal amount.
“You want to make sure that you match the assets towards the liability timeframe well,” said Mr Tan.
It is also worth noting that returns from low-risk investment options generally do not keep pace with inflation. As a result, equities or high-quality longer duration bonds may be more appropriate for those considering longer-term holdings, he said.

The court heard that the offender, a Singapore Permanent Resident, was a teacher with an unidentified school between January 2019 and June 2019.
The 14-year-old victim arrived in Singapore in February 2019 and began studying at the school a month later. 
The offender taught the victim's class mathematics and subsequently exchanged WeChat contact details with her. They began communicating and the victim confided in her teacher about the issues she had as a newly arrived foreign student.
TEACHER INVITES VICTIM TO HIS HOME
Sometime in early April 2019, the teacher invited the victim and her friend, a 20-year-old male student, to his place.
Before the male student arrived, the teacher hugged the victim and kissed her face in his living room. When the male student arrived, the trio had lunch and watched a movie, with the teacher putting his arm around the victim's shoulder.
The trio later moved to the teacher's bedroom where they continued watching the movie on his bed.
The male student left for home before the victim. While the victim was alone with the teacher, the teacher asked her to be his girlfriend.
He did this even though he knew it was not appropriate for a teacher to have a relationship with a student, court documents said. The victim thought about it and agreed, thinking it would be good to have a teacher care for her.
She told the offender that he was her first boyfriend, and she did not know what to expect from her new relationship, as she had no prior dating experience.
Following this, the teacher would kiss the victim in school when no one else was around. He knew she was 14, and told her not to tell anyone about their relationship as it would ""harm her reputation"", court documents said.
He was also concerned about losing his job, and the victim did not disclose her relationship to anyone as she trusted him.
They met multiple times at the teacher's home for sexual activities, with the teacher telling the victim that it was natural for couples to engage in sex.
On one occasion in April 2019, the pair had sex in the teacher's room while watching a movie. The victim was ""nervous"" and ""taken aback"", and felt pain during the encounter.
TEACHER GOT VICTIM TO TAKE CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS
After she left the teacher's house, he texted her to express his fear of her possibly having an unwanted pregnancy. He asked her if they should ""do a little other precaution"" as he was ""panicking a lot"".
He later bought contraceptive pills and the girl ate them according to his instructions.
Around May 2019, the victim told the teacher she planned to transfer to a different school, and he wanted a break-up as they would not be able to meet up regularly thereafter.
They had a mutual break-up on Jun 14, 2019, as it was both the end of the school term and the teacher's last day of employment with the school.
That same day, the victim confided in the 20-year-old male student who had gone with her to the teacher's house.
She said she had just broken up with someone, and revealed to him upon some probing that it was the mathematics teacher. She further told him that they had engaged in sexual activities.
Furious that the teacher had taken advantage of the victim, the male student took the victim to the school to confront the accused.
The accused persuaded the victim not to report the matter to the police as it would ""harm her reputation"", and reminded her that her father would be furious. She eventually decided not to report the matter to the police.
In early July 2019, the victim went home to spend her 15th birthday with her family. She confided in her mother that she had engaged in sexual activities with her teacher.
Her mother was furious and contacted the victim's guardian in Singapore to tell him what had happened. When the victim returned to Singapore later that month, she told her guardian that she wanted to lodge a police report, and he filed a report against the teacher.
At the time of the report, the accused had returned to his home country. He was arrested by the police at Changi Airport when he arrived in Singapore in September 2019.
A November 2019 report from the Child Guidance Clinic of the Institute of Mental Health stated that the victim felt ""sad, angry and fearful"" since she started having sexual activities with the teacher.
She is also ""fearful of males and has difficulty trusting others"", which could lead to difficulties with her social interaction later in life, the prosecutor said.
TO BE A TEACHER IS TO ANSWER A NOBLE CALL
Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng asked for at least five to six years' jail to be imposed on the teacher. He said that any consent ""ostensibly given by the 14-year-old victim in this case cannot be endorsed as positive consent because the victim lacked the requisite maturity"".
""To be a teacher is to answer a noble call,"" he said. ""Society entrusts teachers with the responsibility to mould our young minds and the power to shape their character and convictions.""
He added that children look to their teachers not merely as educators but mentors and role models, and the accused abused the trust accorded to him ""instead of fulfilling this high calling"".
District Judge Paul Chan said the defence took pains to underscore that the victim was a ""willing participant"" in the relationship and all sexual encounters.
""This is correct. However, that there was no coercion does not mean that the victim was not vulnerable,"" said Judge Chan.
He added that the accused was entrusted ""with a solemn responsibility to educate the victim and be an example for the victim"" as a teacher.
""At the very least, society expects teachers not to take advantage of the youthfulness, immaturity and relative lack of life experience of those placed in their care"", said Judge Chan."
CNA Explains: Why cats are not allowed in HDB flats and how that could soon change,"""HDB and NParks/Animal & Veterinary Service are exploring the possibility of allowing cats to be kept as pets in HDB flats,"" says HDB. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-why-cats-are-not-allowed-hdb-flats-and-how-could-soon-change-2921006,"SINGAPORE: Cats could be allowed in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats if a proposed framework to manage felines is implemented.
The Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) is currently seeking public feedback on its proposed measures to improve the management and welfare of cats, including possibly allowing pet cats in HDB flats.
The public consultation will run for six months, from September 2022 to March 2023.
CNA takes a look at the 30-year-old ban on the keeping of cats in HDB flats and how the latest public consultation on the proposed feline welfare framework comes on the back of growing calls to legalise cat ownership in HDBs.
WHY ARE CATS NOT ALLOWED IN FLATS?
According to HDB, cats are not allowed in flats as ""they are generally difficult to contain within the flat"".
""When allowed to roam indiscriminately, they tend to shed fur and defecate or urinate in public areas, and also make caterwauling sounds, which can inconvenience your neighbours,"" said HDB.
A ban on cats as pets in HDB flats has been in place since 1989.
A person may be fined up to S$4,000 if found to have a pet cat in their flat under the Housing and Development (Animals) Rules.
In response to CNA's queries, HDB said that its ""principal consideration is to preserve a pleasant and harmonious living environment in HDB estates, as well as maintain good neighbourly relations"".  
""To this end, we strive to balance the interests of residents who are pet lovers and those who may be affected by disamenities as a result of irresponsible pet ownership.""
HDB added that together with AVS, it is ""exploring the possibility of allowing cats to be kept as pets in HDB flats, taking into consideration feedback from the public consultation"".
More details will be shared when ready, it said.

PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PROPOSED CAT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The public consultation will run for six months, from September 2022 to March 2023, said AVS in a press release on Saturday (Sep 3).
This includes a two-month online survey for the public, which is currently available on AVS’ website until Nov 2.
It proposed expanding the existing pet dog licensing and microchipping scheme to include pet cats. 
HDB told CNA this will allow cats to be traceable, and cat owners can be held accountable for their pets. 
""This will help mitigate potential concerns about disamenities in the community,"" it added.
The second proposal looks to extend the Trap-Neuter-Rehome/Release-Manage (TNRM) programme for free-roaming dogs to community cats as well.
Such cats will be sterilised after capture, and then rehomed where possible or released back into the community.
Thirdly, AVS proposed continued partnership with the community and animal welfare groups to explore ways to further promote responsible cat ownership, the adoption of cats, and responsible community cat caregiving.
""An example is sharing with new pet owners on caring for their pets. Such efforts will help to protect the health and welfare of our pets,"" said AVS.
The agency aims to share the findings of the public consultation exercise and its revised recommendations in 2023.
PROJECT LOVE CATS AND #SGCATSINFLATS
A pilot programme called Project Love Cats was launched in October 2012 in Chong Pang.
The project was supported by its Member of Parliament K Shanmugam. The programme was also supported by the Ministry of National Development (MND).
Project Love Cats was effected to test a community management framework on responsible cat ownership, said AVS at that time.
In response to queries from CNA, the Cat Welfare Society said that Project Love Cats is still ongoing, adding that 126 registered households were identified through door-to-door engagement.
It also found that 90 per cent of the identified owners were responsible cat owners, while the remainder were ""irresponsible and recalcitrant and contributed to the majority of cat-related feedback in their area.""
The Cat Welfare Society said its #sgcatsinflats surveys across five constituencies in 2022 showed continued support for its position, with approximately 91 per cent not objecting to the legalisation of cat ownership in HDBs.
""We are ready as a society to remove the cat ban and allow for responsible cat ownership in our HDBs,"" it said.

RALLYING CALLS
The Cat Welfare Society in a Facebook post on Sunday said that it needs HDB to legalise cat ownership in its flats as the vast majority of cat owners are ""responsible"".
""Why should we be lumped together with those who are irresponsible, who cause complaints,"" it said.
The society said it also supported the microchipping and TRNM programme that was proposed, and added that this ""is the first real opportunity we have to make our voices heard and to help people understand what we are so passionate about"".
MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) brought up the issue of keeping cats in Housing Board flats in Parliament earlier this year. He referenced Law Society president Adrian Tan's LinkedIn post.
In the post, Mr Tan broke down HDB's reasons for banning cats, calling all of them ""terrible"".
Mr Ng said that ""it is time that we progress on this issue and change our policy to accept what we already accept in reality – that HDB residents are allowed to keep cats, who can be removed if they are found to cause disamenities within the community"".
Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said at the time that ""we are considering this issue from various angles, including enhancing our strategies for the management of both pet cats and stray cats, to effectively manage the overall population of cats in Singapore"".

Man admits to riding e-scooter on road during accident that injured pillion rider after NUS party,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/e-scooter-accident-riding-road-nus-party-2921121,"SINGAPORE: After consuming alcohol at a party at the National University of Singapore (NUS), a 21-year-old undergraduate rode an e-scooter back to his hostel and got into an accident along the way.
The impact flung him and his 20-year-old pillion rider onto the road, causing her to pass out.
Chuang Fu Yuan pleaded guilty on Monday (Sep 5) to one charge under the Road Traffic Act of riding a personal mobility device on the road.
The court heard that Chuang was an NUS undergraduate at the time of the offence on Feb 27, 2019. 
At about 8pm that night, he met with about 15 of his fellow undergraduates at the Sheares Hall clan room for a party. They included the victim Dai Yi Ting and another undergraduate, 22-year-old Darren Chong Chi Chao.
During the party, they had dinner and alcoholic drinks such as vodka and beer.
At about 11pm, Chuang, Chong and Dai decided to return to their dormitory rooms. As it was quite a distance away, they decided to ride e-scooters which were available to NUS students as part of a collaboration between Grabwheels and the university.
Chuang and Chong each rented an e-scooter and Dai rode pillion with Chuang.
The undergraduates travelled along Heng Mui Keng Terrace, before turning into Kent Ridge Drive and Kent Ridge Crescent towards University Hall.
Along Kent Ridge Crescent, Chuang overtook Chong's e-scooter near Yusof Ishak House and travelled downslope towards a roundabout.
According to court documents, Chong saw Chuang's e-scooter come to a sudden and complete stop, causing Chuang and Dai to be flung off before landing on the road. 
Chuang was injured but conscious, while Dai was unconscious. She suffered injuries to her lung and head.
The judge called for a report assessing Chuang's suitability for probation and adjourned sentencing to October.
For riding a personal mobility device on the road, he could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000, or both."
"Man gets jail, caning for sexually assaulting 11-year-old girl he found on Instagram and giving her drugs",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jail-caning-sexual-assault-primary-school-girl-instagram-drugs-court-2920956,"SINGAPORE: A 34-year-old man was sentenced on Monday (Sep 5) to 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane after sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and giving her drugs.
Muhammad Hisham Abdul Karim ""trawled the Internet"" before zeroing in on a primary school student and befriending her via Instagram, the court heard.
He later sexually assaulted her multiple times and gave her Ice – the street name for methamphetamine – to smoke in the back of a lorry.
Hisham pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault by penetration of a minor, with another 11 charges taken into consideration.
The court heard that Hisham viewed the Instagram profile of the victim, who was then 11, around May 2017. The victim was a primary school student and made reference to her school in her Instagram biography. She also posted photos of herself wearing her school jersey.
Hisham sent her a friend request and began chatting with her. When the victim viewed Hisham's Instagram account, she noticed that he had also followed several of her school friends.
Hisham met the victim at a staircase landing in a building sometime before mid-November 2017, according to court documents.
At the staircase landing, he kissed the victim and committed sex acts on her. They met up again that year, with Hisham picking the girl up in his motorcycle before heading to an open-air car park around Woodlands. 
He got the girl to board the back of a covered lorry belonging to a company he worked for, before joining her.
They chatted in the back of the lorry, and Hisham produced a white crystalline substance, telling her it was Ice, a street name for meth. He also gave her a glass ball with a rubber tube and told her to smoke it.
She did so, and Hisham committed sex acts on her before sending her home.
Their relationship later soured and they stopped contacting each other. The offences came to light in February 2020, when the victim attended a session with a case worker and revealed that she had sex with Hisham in 2017.
A police report was lodged and Hisham was arrested.
The court heard that he was previously convicted in 2016 of one count of sexual penetration of a minor and was sentenced to 10 months' jail. 
Justice Mavis Chionh noted that the victim in the latest case was a vulnerable one, and the offences were ""clearly premeditated and deviously planned"".
She said Hisham ""trawled the Internet"" and ""zeroed in on the victim and her primary school friends on Instagram"" before initiating contact. He knew ""full well"" that she was a primary school student, said the judge.
Giving the girl a drug to consume was an aggravating factor as it would have rendered her more vulnerable, said Justice Chionh. 
Hisham also exposed her to the grave risk of sexually transmitted diseases. He admitted to a psychiatrist that he frequented sex workers from 2013 to 2018.
The judge disagreed with the starting point of 11 years' jail per proceeded charge, saying it should be higher. She noted that the punishment Hisham received in 2016 for his previous crime ""did not teach him anything"".
A psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health examined Hisham and found that he met the criteria for paedophilic disorder, with a moderate overall risk of sexual reoffending and an ""alarming clear escalation"" in the chronicity of his sexual offences.
For sexual assault by penetration of a minor under 16, he could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years' jail, and given at least 12 strokes of the cane."
21-year-old scam victim who became money mule says loansharks still harass her,"Lisa wanted to borrow S$30,000 from a moneylender. She ended up being harassed by loansharks and investigated by police, all while never getting a single cent.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scam-money-mule-loanshark-laundering-police-2918461,"SINGAPORE: A few months were all it took for Lisa (not her real name), 21, to spiral from being a victim of scam to a perpetrator of crime.
She started with legitimate intentions to get a S$30,000 loan from a licensed moneylender, but ended up losing even more cash in a loan scam while getting viciously harassed by loansharks.
To top it off, Lisa was threatened into giving up her ATM card, and her account was used to transfer illicit funds. She was eventually given a conditional warning by the police for being a money mule.
Latest figures released by the police in August showed another increase in scams - 85 per cent up in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year - driving up the total reported cases of crime.
The Government also announced in March that it intends to make it easier for money laundering offences to be prosecuted at lower levels of culpability, by amending the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, likely in the fourth quarter of this year.
""Today, a large proportion of investigations into money mules do not result in prosecutions, due to the inherent difficulties in proving the money mule’s intent to participate in moving monies for scam syndicates,"" Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan had said.
When asked how it felt like being both a victim and accused, Lisa told reporters on Thursday (Aug 25) that she feels “bad”. “But at the same time, I’m still scared because they did harass my family,” she said.

Lisa’s desire to care for her family was how she got into this situation in the first place.
In December 2020, she was barely earning S$2,000 a month as an auxiliary security officer when she gave birth to a boy.
Her jobless husband used her money for his personal expenses, she said, adding that he quickly grew tired of caring for the baby.
Lisa, who also has a daughter - then 5 years old - living in Malaysia with an uncle, decided to go back to work during her confinement period.
“He was not helping in anything ... I needed to support my family and pay the outstanding bills,” she said. “And if I had enough money, I would go back to study. Because Singapore is all about (having) the certificate.”
Lisa said her thoughts went “haywire” as she went on the Internet to search for moneylenders.
She found a company with a name and website that looked legitimate enough, so she clicked on an icon to get in touch via WhatsApp.
This was the beginning of Lisa’s months-long nightmare that revolved around persistent demands for money as well as threats to her family, before culminating in her being investigated as a money laundering suspect.
The moneylender asked Lisa, a Singapore permanent resident, for her personal details before releasing the loan. So, she sent pictures of her payslips as well as her Singapore and Malaysia identity cards.
The first red flag was when the moneylender asked her to pay an administrative fee amounting to 10 per cent of the loan.
“They told me this after I gave my details,” she said. “I was having doubts. Why do I need to pay when I never received what I wanted to borrow?”
When Lisa refused to pay, the man started berating her. He sent audio notes threatening her family and videos of front doors getting drenched in paint, a common intimidation technique employed by loansharks.
“I was scared,” she said. “I was panicking and I didn’t know what to do. I just transferred whatever amount I had.”
Lisa eventually paid the man S$3,000, but instead of getting her loan, the man demanded that she settle a late fee as well.

She insisted that she had no money left, but the harassment continued. The man said he did not care about her circumstances, warning her that she needed to pay the fee by a certain deadline.
Around that time, Lisa made a police report online, believing that she had been scammed and fearing for her children. She also told her family about what happened. They got angry and pressed her to ignore the threats and not transfer more money.
As Lisa waited for a response from the police, her family’s advice was less reassuring. She said she felt “alone” throughout her ordeal. “I was still panicking and I actually didn’t know what to do. I continued finding ways to pay them,” she added.
She soon cracked under the pressure and dipped into the “little bit” of savings she had left to pay off the admin fee.
In January 2021, her troubles escalated when more loansharks started harassing her and claiming she owed money. She suspected that her details were used to borrow from other illicit moneylenders.
To deter the loansharks, police officers installed a closed-circuit television camera outside her home for a period of time. Lisa said this could be why she has not been physically harassed.
TRANSITION TO MONEY MULE
One of the loansharks soon offered Lisa some kind of solution: If she handed over her ATM card, she could get about S$300 a month, ostensibly to service her debts.
Lisa was told she would get more money if she gave more ATM cards. At her wits’ end, she surrendered the cards to her three bank accounts.
“I was having doubts also but I was scared. Because while they talked about this, they kept threatening about the money that I (supposedly) owed,” she said.
Police told CNA that scammers recruit mules to transfer stolen money on their behalf.
Common schemes include jobs that allow people to earn attractive salaries while working from home and performing ""relatively easy"" tasks, like using their personal bank account to receive and transfer money.
Mules are also asked to relinquish their Singpass, which may subsequently be used to register companies and open bank accounts.
""The offer can be between S$200 to S$2,000 for each bank account or Singpass relinquished, but most of the mules did not get their monies,"" police said.

Indeed, Lisa said she never received any of the promised remuneration and could not check what her accounts were being used for. Her bank account PIN and online banking credentials were changed, and she said the bank could not attend to her unless she produced an ATM card.
On the back end, one of the banks flagged Lisa’s accounts to the police, suspicious that despite her modest income, tens of thousands of dollars were flooding through them each day.
Worse still, the harassment and demands to settle her phantom debt carried on.
Whenever Lisa agreed to pay something, the loansharks quickly gave her a list of bank accounts with corresponding amounts to transfer to. This is typical of how criminal syndicates operate, to complicate the money trail and take advantage of other victims.
""In general, a money mule’s actions help to perpetuate the criminal syndicate’s operations by aiding them to move the ill-gotten gains to avoid police’s detection,"" police said.
THREATS BECOMING REAL
While Lisa was still physically safe, the threats to her family were acted upon.
In Malaysia, loansharks splashed paint on another uncle’s house - not where her daughter lives - and later her grandmother’s house, the address of which was on her Malaysia identity card.
Because her Singapore identity card had her own address, she worried that it was only a matter of time before the loansharks got to her.
She said her husband had, against her wishes, previously whisked their son away for a week, and she feared that the loansharks could also take her child.
When Lisa told the loansharks that she was in contact with the police, they got even more brazen and challenged officers to catch them.
Police started collating information about Lisa’s case - including the first report she made on the harassment - and summoned her for an interview sometime in March 2021. Lisa said she was “shocked” when she saw a letter from the police in the mailbox.
Lisa said she knew why she was being questioned, and insisted that she did not know what her account was being used for. The investigation officer considered the circumstances and eventually gave her a two-year conditional warning for being a money mule.






      Some money mules sell their Singpass details to scammers.
    






The police warned that people could still be prosecuted for being money mules even if they claim to be unaware of what they have done.
""Police would like to caution the public against dealing with money from unknown sources or assisting in the transfer and receipt of money without a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore,"" it said.
""You should always reject requests to use your personal bank accounts to receive and transfer money for others.""
Ultimately, the police said it takes a tough stance against money mule activities, adding that those convicted of money laundering could be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$500,000.
""If the money that you receive and transfer is stolen money or linked to crimes, you may be investigated and charged for committing a criminal offence,"" it stated.
ORDEAL NOT OVER
Lisa said she continues to get harassed by loansharks to this day, citing how she sometimes get calls from them on numbers that look identical to that of her friends’.
“When I answer, it’s actually a loanshark,” she said, adding that she would immediately say no and hang up when a stranger mentions her name. “It never ends, because they still contact me from time to time.”
Lisa said the entire incident has made it very difficult for her to trust people. She acknowledged that a mixture of fear and the fact that she had parted with cash made it difficult for her to escape the clutches of loansharks.





She lost more than S$5,000 in total, a sum she is not hopeful of getting back. She advised youths tempted to make a quick buck to find a job instead, and if they really needed to borrow money, to look for licensed moneylenders and visit their premises.
The Ministry of Law's website has a list of licensed moneylenders.
Lisa said her decision to click on that WhatsApp icon and chat with the first moneylender was the moment that changed her life.
“I mean, if I never did that, all these wouldn’t have happened,” she added.
THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND IT
It is worth noting that Lisa's case is a little different from typical scam or money mule cases that involve some form of a carrot and stick approach. Lisa never received a single cent before being sucked into the scheme.
Mr Lee Rong Cheng, lead psychologist at the Singapore Police Force, said the circumstances in Lisa's case appeared to be ""very drastic"".
""The scammers may not think that there is a need to dangle any very significant carrot for her to be obliging to the scammer's suggestions, because the need on the victim's end is already so high,"" he explained.
""So in that sense, we can also see this as a resource management part on the scammer's end. As a whole, they are an organisation thinking of how to better allocate their resources as well. And this may have played out in this way for this particular victim.""
Still, Mr Lee pointed out that the scammer still dangled some form of reward in the middle of the scheme, by urging Lisa to hand over her bank accounts under the guise of facilitating quicker returns.
""The victim will not hesitate to do so, because they are just so much in a sense of anxiety and fearfulness that their commitment will go to waste,"" he said.
""Thus, they will just oblige to all the scammer's suggestions, and in turn, they unwittingly become money mules.""

This fear stems from the constant harassment, Mr Lee said, noting that scammers will ""make you feel that they know a lot about you: Where you stay, what you normally do, who are in your family"".
""It gives you a very negative experience that you're now being targeted by someone, and that makes the person increasingly fearful of what else may happen,"" he said. ""What if I need to take my kids to school? Do they know where my kids are studying?""
This leads to a ""continued sense of paranoia"" that further prevents the victim from making logical decisions, Mr Lee continued.
""It makes them potentially more vulnerable to suggestions from the harasser, like maybe this is the way to go to get out of this situation,"" he added.
""That tunnel vision actually works in the favour of the scammer.""
MORE YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SCAMS
Another factor could be age.
A majority of those arrested for their involvement in scams in the first half of 2022 were aged 20 to 29, the latest police figures revealed.
Of the total number of people police arrested in 2019 to 2021 for their involvement in scams reported in the year of their arrest, around 38 per cent were aged 20 to 29.
When asked if younger people like Lisa were more susceptible to wanting to make a quick buck and ending up as money mules, Mr Lee said they could be a ""little bit more impressionable"".
""At the youth stage, the brain development hasn't matured yet, especially in terms of your prefrontal cortex that governs executive decision making,"" he added.
""And thus, youth in general may find it harder to resist temptation.""

"230,000 children to receive S$200 Child Development Account top-ups","The CDA top-up will be credited in batches to all Singaporean children aged 6 and below from Sep 8.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/230000-singapore-child-development-account-top-budget-2022-msf-mof-2920901,"SINGAPORE: About 230,000 children will each receive a one-off top-up of S$200 to their Child Development Account (CDA) from Thursday (Sep 8).
The CDA top-up will benefit all Singaporean children aged six and below in 2022, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in a joint press release on Monday.
The CDA top-up is part of the Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022 to provide families with additional support for their child-raising expenses.
Funds in the CDA can be used to pay for the child's education and healthcare needs.
""The S$200 will be credited directly into the child’s CDA in batches from Sep 8 or after the CDA is opened, whichever is later,"" said the joint statement, adding that parents who have yet to open a CDA will need to do so by Jun 30, 2023 for their children to receive the top-up.
Those who are eligible will receive notifications through SMS, email or a hardcopy letter after the CDA top-ups have been credited.
Parents can view their child’s CDA balance by checking their bank’s monthly CDA statement.
Children aged seven to 20 had also received a one-off top-up of S$200 to their Edusave account or Post-Secondary Education Account in May this year.

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teachers-burnt-out-overwork-parents-support-schools-2919346,"SINGAPORE: Every week, Sandra (not her real name) lugs a small suitcase from her workplace back home. She’s neither a flight attendant nor a fashion designer — but a teacher bringing back her students’ papers for the weekend.
“We joke that we’re like air stewardesses, bringing our luggage back home after a long flight,” said the primary school mother tongue teacher.
“Because there’s so much to do in school that isn’t part of the classroom curriculum that my students’ homework has to be marked on the weekend. It’s easier to lug their exercise books than hand carry since there's up to 120 books.”
Like the other teachers who spoke to TODAY, Sandra joined the profession as she saw teaching as a noble job, allowing her to shape a future generation.
However, having to spend hours clearing administrative work, planning co-curricular activities (CCA) and handling parents have tired these teachers out.
All the teachers interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media. 
“By the time the day ends and I’m done with meetings, I’ll have barely started on marking homework or might be in the midst of preparing for the next class,” said Sandra, who has been teaching for four years.
Beyond the heavy workload, secondary school teacher Mandy also struggles to draw the line when it comes to her working hours.
“Sometimes, there are children who need someone to speak to, and it can be a life or death situation. We’ll chat into the early hours of the morning, and while draining, I’m glad I can make a difference,” said the teacher with 20 years of experience.
“But other times, parents are contacting me over menial things like homework past my work hours, and expect me to respond almost instantly. It does take a toll because the line between my work and my life is blurred, I can’t just shut off.”
Teachers feeling overworked and facing burn-out is a perennial issue in Singapore, where there are high public expectations of the role that schools and teachers play in a child's life. 
Just last year, a letter to the Straits Times' forum page penned by a husband of a teacher went viral when he called for teachers' workloads to be relooked so his wife could have more time with their family.
""How can we stop teachers from being exhausted and burnt out? They are already entering the school before sunrise and leaving only after sunset. The marking and calls to be answered continue at home,"" he said.

As educators in Singapore marked Teachers’ Day on Friday (Sep 2), the perennial issues that teachers face on a daily basis have also come under the spotlight. Last month, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said it would give its teachers, allied educators and MOE kindergarten educators a pay increase of between 5 and 10 per cent as part of efforts to “continue to attract and retain good educators”.
Barely a week later, the problems teachers face in disciplining students also became a talking point after a St Andrew’s Secondary School student was caught on video arguing and threatening his teacher with violence. The video first surfaced on Aug 23.
Over the years, MOE has launched a slew of initiatives to better support teachers — most recently via a teacher-focused version of mental health online portal, Mindline. Still, the educators interviewed believe that more could be done to address the key issue of heavy workload.
One way to do this is to relieve them of some administrative duties and CCAs, so that they can, as Sandra put it, “get back to the core purpose of what a teacher is supposed to do, teach”.
In response to TODAY’s queries, MOE said that it has taken steps to help lighten teachers' workloads, such as technology to streamline administrative processes and providing additional funding for schools to hire staff for administrative duties.
It also has put in place measures to support staff well-being, such as in-house professional counselling services and a ""whole-of-government 24/7 counselling hotline"" for public officers.
Separately, the Singapore Teachers’ Union (STU) also provides a suite of career coaching services, as well as counselling services, to help its members ""identify and overcome workplace challenges"", said its secretary-general Mike Thiruman.
In all, MOE employs slightly over 32,000 teachers. In response to TODAY's queries on the annual resignation rate over the past five years, the ministry would only say that it has remained ""relatively low and stable"" at between 2 and 3 per cent ""over the last few years"". 
Apart from the overall workload, other challenges commonly cited by the teachers interviewed included how they are assessed by their superiors.
But the biggest bugbear was dealing with parents — be it in terms of disciplining their child, intervening with how the teachers carry out their lessons, or expecting teachers to be ""surrogate parents"" or ""babysitters"" who know the whereabouts of their child and what they are up to after school.  
Indeed, MOE stressed that its efforts to help teachers must be matched by parents as well.
""Parents play a key role in supporting teachers’ well-being, by respecting the personal time and space of our teachers and minimising non-critical communication with their children’s teachers outside office hours,"" the ministry said. 
It added: ""Parents and the public can also work closely with teachers to establish positive partnerships and set appropriate expectations on the teachers’ responsibilities for our children’s development.""

TEACHERS BEMOAN PARENTS' INTERFERENCE, ""LACK OF RESPECT""
For Mandy, the work continues long after official school hours, with her phone notifications constantly going off, as students and parents send messages into the wee hours of the night.
“It started during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we had to keep in contact with our students while isolated in our homes. The only way to do so is by having class group chats, and that means giving out my phone number to (all the students).”
She recalled how she would have to call her students when they did not turn up for online lessons, and how some parents would not take responsibility to ensure their children attended classes online even though they were all at home together. 
And with MOE encouraging more blended learning post-pandemic — where students learn through a mix of online and offline activities held in school and at home — STU's Mr Thiruman said parental support would “become even more critical for students to benefit from it”.
“Blended learning poses challenges on multiple fronts. It requires more and in-depth preparation and post-lesson monitoring, in addition to requiring new pedagogical approaches,” said Mr Thiruman.
Mandy also noted that it's harder to discipline students now, as parents often refuse to take the teacher’s side. 
She recalled how she once called up the parents of a student two weeks after he did not hand in his homework. ""Instead of chiding their child, they asked why I didn’t push (the student) to give his homework and inform them earlier,” she said.
She added: “Parents are very permissive and will insist that their child is right over other professional adults in the school, who may be all saying the same thing. It’s always the teachers or school’s fault ... This makes it hard to discipline the students because they don’t receive the consequences at home.”
A secondary school teacher, who wanted to be known only as Germaine, has been teaching for almost four decades. She lamented how ""discipline has dropped tremendously in school"" over the years. ""It was much easier to discipline the kids in the earlier years,"" she said. 
Sandra felt that children with overprotective parents are sometimes impossible to discipline.
“For the male students, (my colleagues and I) will say they’ll only wake up during their National Service because they won’t listen to any of us. And their parents don’t have as much of a say there as compared to (in school),” she said.
Some of the teachers interviewed also observed that parents’ respect for teachers has diminished over the years and this has also influenced students’ attitudes towards them.

A primary school teacher of 15 years, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ng, said: “When I first started working, there were no parent WhatsApp group chats where parents can talk about their grievances and make troll remarks. 
“Now, these chat groups, where parents used to share information about their children’s academics, are also used to share comments about bad teacher experiences, which parents (then go on to) share with their children, diluting their respect towards teachers.”
He added that the rise of social media use and its growing influence on children — especially in families where parents do not spend enough quality time with their children — has also compounded the situation, with children picking up bad behaviour they see online.
Acknowledging that issues relating to discipline are often multi-faceted, MOE said that schools, parents and the community must collaborate together to instil the right values and behaviours in students.
To support schools, MOE provides principles and guidelines for schools to formulate their discipline policies and approaches
""When teachers experience incidents of open defiance, they will be supported by their school leaders and the student management team, who will assist to investigate the incident, engage parents of the student and mete out consequences where appropriate,"" said MOE.
The ministry added that as part of the teacher preparation courses at the National Institute of Education (NIE), teachers are trained in classroom management, including equipping them to manage students who show ""disruptive behaviour"".
MOE also provides teachers with ""professional development support in enhancing teacher-student relationships and counselling skills to nurture a positive classroom culture"".
Echoing the sentiment of the teachers who spoke to TODAY, the ministry reiterated parents' important role when it comes to students' behaviour. 
""Even so, effective discipline is only possible with the support of parents, who play a critical role in instilling and reinforcing the right values and behaviour in their children. Schools will continue partnering parents closely to support students holistically,"" MOE said.

Commentary: Teachers can focus better if subjective, irrelevant factors removed from annual appraisals













WHEN TEACHERS ARE EXPECTED TO ""BABYSIT"" CHILDREN, COUNSEL PARENTS 
Ironically, even as respect for teachers appears to be declining on the part of parents, their expectations have increased. They want teachers to act as their children’s ""babysitters"", or adopt customised teaching approaches for each child — which translates to even more work for the educators.
A former English and English literature junior college (JC) teacher, who wished to be known as Ms V Loh, recalled how parents would treat her like a “surrogate parent”, asking questions about their children’s private lives.
“During a teacher-parent meeting, one parent came up to me and asked if their child was having sex, which shocked me,” said the 53-year-old, who quit teaching in 2018 after 25 years due to her health and as her JC was about to be merged. She is now a private tutor.
“How would I know what their child does outside of the classroom? It’s crazy,” she said. 
Another parent had recorded their teacher-parent meeting before asking her to sign a contract-like document. “I don’t know what I was signing, but I did it to please the parent and get them to leave … (His actions) were so passive-aggressive,” Ms Loh added.
Some requests which teachers have received from parents include reporting to them when their child leaves school, creating a special curriculum to cater to their child, and demanding one-on-one tuition for their child after work hours.
For primary school teacher Mabel, her job scope has even extended to becoming a counsellor for parents.
“Teaching has changed so much since I started in 1996, but mainly because of parents. When MOE started placing more emphasis on parent engagements, we had to deal with some who may carry their own emotional baggage that can stress us out,” she said. 
Despite the challenges of dealing with parents, teachers cannot treat it lightly as it can affect their yearly appraisal — however, the extent to which it does is subjective based on their managers, said teachers.
Some parents would compare homework, spelling lists, use of technology in classrooms and more, which forces teachers to do even more for their students to avoid incurring the ire of parents.
Sandra said: “They’ll say ‘this other teacher did something, why can’t you?’ and it’s hard to say anything in response that will pacify such kiasu parents.”
Nevertheless, Ms Loh, the former teacher, noted that parents these days have higher expectations of teachers and are more interested in what their children learn in school because they themselves are more educated, compared with parents in the past. And this was something that she, as a mother herself, can understand, she said. 
“I have two daughters in their 20s, but when they were still in school, sometimes I would look through their English exam papers and write notes to their teachers next to questions which could be worded better or should have their marks relooked,” she said. 
Mr Ng noted that some parents would also ask for concessions for their children’s marks to raise their grades, to which he would respond by explaining the real world consequences of such mistakes.
“For example, a parent told me that his child was just one degree off in an answer in his maths paper. But I’ll explain that one degree can make a difference if that child becomes an engineer, so they understand where we are coming from,” he said.

THE END RESULT? PARENTS AS ""CUSTOMERS"", RISK-AVERSE TEACHERS
When it comes to their children’s education needs, parents often get whatever they demand — simply because teachers don’t find it worth their while to risk their reputation by doing otherwise, those interviewed told TODAY.
Likening teachers to service staff, Sandra said: “Parents are like our customers. If we don’t make them happy, they’ll complain until we have no choice but to do it.”
As her school did not offer a subject to students at certain levels, a parent sent a letter of complaint — forcing teachers in her school to create a year’s curriculum for a single child.
“It was exhausting and not necessary in my opinion to cave in, but we had to anyway. There’s no point fighting parents because of this,” she said, adding that complaints from parents can also impact a teacher's yearly appraisal.
TODAY approached three principals for comments, but they declined to speak as they needed approval from the ministry to do so.
Germaine, the secondary school teacher, said that when a school receives a complaint, an investigation has to be initiated, despite the possibility that the claim is untrue or inaccurate.
“The way schools interrogate teachers when a complaint is received can be emotionally draining and discouraging for a teacher,” she said.
As Mr Ng pointed out, parent chat groups have been used to spread comments about teachers, affecting their reputation.
Other teachers told TODAY that the possibility of rumours being spread about their professional competency hangs like the sword of Damocles over their heads; any mistake can put teachers in the parents’ bad books. Hence, pacifying parents is now part of their job scope.
On this issue, the teachers wished that they could get more backing.
Germaine said. “Some teachers have left teaching as they are disillusioned with the lack of support for them (from school authorities) when there is a conflict between a teacher and the parents.”
Sandra added: “Sometimes, even if the school management does try to explain to parents why some action can’t be taken, parents will complain to (higher-ups) and we have no choice but to conform.”
For some teachers, the presence of mobile phones in the classroom can also be unnerving.
Ms Loh, the former JC teacher, said her students’ phones made her feel like she was always under surveillance when teaching.
She pointed out: “It’s hard to be innovative when teaching in class and to be my authentic self with these students, who are young adults, when a video or photo could send the wrong image to one or two parents when (viewed) out of context.”
THE LONGSTANDING ISSUE OF TOO MUCH ADMIN WORK 
For Ms Loh, administrative work would take up most of her day even back when she first started teaching in 1993 — not something she had expected to be saddled with when she joined the profession.
“I remember we were organising for some event in school, so I spent a whole week out of school getting quotes from vendors once classes ended, which was just ridiculous,” she said.
“It was taking up time away from my family and myself, so when I had children, I took a six-year childcare break where I just helped with relief teaching before switching to contract teaching.”
Contract adjunct teaching allows MOE teachers to take on just part of a teacher’s workload, with a salary pro-rated based on the work they take up.
“I didn't need to deal with CCAs and these event planning activities, but I was still handling administrative work like contacting parents, collecting forms and daily attendance for my form class,” Ms Loh said.
Some administrative work that teachers must go through weekly, on top of teaching itself, are:
Daily attendance taking, contacting parents when students are absent without reason
Giving out and collating documents such as bursary documents and donation envelopes
Writing reports when students misbehave
Planning for CCA activities, such as sourcing vendor quotes and preparing CCA materials
Planning school events
Weekly department meetings
Teachers interviewed estimated that they spend at least four hours a day on administrative duties outside of the classroom and fixed CCA hours, forcing them to prepare teaching materials or mark students' homework outside of their work hours.
And when students act up in class, Mr Ng said it “multiplies, not adds” to teacher’s workloads.
“We have to fill up paperwork when taking disciplinary action, speak to their parents and pay special attention to such students,” he said.
Sandra added that there is also extra paperwork when referring a child to an allied educator or counsellor for help, and they may need to provide weekly updates on the child’s performance in class.
Mabel added that these forms also require ""extensive details"" like what methods have helped guide the child and what have not.




Listen: Generation Z fight back media portrayals














In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, they had the added job of contact tracing, ensuring students turn up for online classes, and trying their best to engage them despite being behind a screen.
With home-based learning as the norm, older teachers said they struggled to adapt to the technology, although younger teachers like Sandra said it was not difficult to adapt.
“It’s easier now though, because we have the Student Learning Space (SLS) platform where teachers across the different schools can upload their teaching materials, and access others’ materials,” said Sandra.
“So we just need to make slight adjustments to fit our classes, which makes it easier to incorporate technology in our classes now, compared to two years ago.”
While policies differ among schools as COVID-19 becomes endemic, some will switch classes to home-based learning when more than five students get infected — hence the SLS platform and years of practice have helped make the switch easier.
Addressing the teachers' feedback on workload, MOE noted that teachers have to prepare students for the ""complex environment"" which the world has become. And this means that teachers have to ""dedicate time and effort to develop the requisite competencies"" in students to prepare them for the workforce in future. 
To that end, the ministry said it has ""strengthened measures and enhanced support for schools to manage teachers’ workload, and to support their well-being"".
Among other things, it has ""calibrated the implementation of initiatives and schools' involvement in headquarter work and pilots"".
It added: ""Schools have flexibility to pace the implementation of selected initiatives, including deferring implementation if this helps to manage staff workload.""
MOE has also provided school leaders with guidelines on managing teachers' workload. These cover areas including assigning teachers to CCAs and school committees and having ""protected vacation time"" for teachers during school holidays to ""ensure that teachers have time to rest and recharge"". 
To ease the administrative workload, the ministry also provides ""strengthened centralised services"" such as support for complex procurement and finance issues.
MOE noted that all schools have an administrative team that helps with administrative and operational functions, and schools are also given additional funding to hire more administrative staff when needed. 
The use of technology is also encouraged to streamline administrative processes, the ministry said. For example, teachers can now monitor and track students' attendance using mobile phones, or collect consent forms and disseminate information to parents via Parents' Gateway, a mobile application.
The ministry reiterated that it ""regularly reviews our manpower deployment to ensure that every school is adequately resourced, and will take steps to provide support and to review teacher workload where needed"". 
On the issue of staffing, some of the teachers interviewed were also keen on having smaller classroom sizes, in tandem with MOE's move to make mainstream schools more inclusive. 
Mabel said: “Children with special needs may need more help, and we also need to help their classmates understand concepts like special needs. This adds to our workload because we don’t have the time to dedicate to all students, and I don’t want to fail in teaching my students.""
On the benefits of having smaller classrooms, Mr Ng added: “When one or two students don’t understand a topic, I can just pause the class and focus on this topic, and not need to leave behind other kids to keep the entire class engaged. With fewer students, they are also easy to connect with.”
MOE said it adopts a ""needs-based resourcing approach where more teachers are channelled to support smaller class sizes for specific student profiles identified with greater learning needs"". These include students who require literacy and numeracy support and those with special educational needs.
The ministry added: ""This is a targeted approach that would be more sustainable and cost-effective, compared to an across-the-board reduction in class sizes.""
CONCERNS OVER GRADING SYSTEM FOR TEACHERS
For some teachers, the need to pander to parents, avoid student complaints and handle multiple administrative duties stoically is fuelled by the MOE grading system.
The ministry adopts a system of relative ranking, where a teacher’s performance is both assessed by his own supervisor, and cross-ranked with his peers by a ranking panel comprising direct and indirect supervisors.
This is also used by the rest of the Civil Service and allows them to ""recognise the good work that (the teachers) have done"", said MOE. 
Teachers told TODAY that beyond just their students’ performances, other factors such as their relationship with parents, administrative duties and leadership roles affect their grades.
Nevertheless, there are mixed views about the grading system.  
A secondary school teacher, who asked to be identified as Jamie, said: “There is workplace politics involved, since allocating leadership events are part of the duties of those ranking us.
“If your supervisors dislike you, it’ll be difficult to attain a good grade.”
Other teachers also noted that some CCAs are seen as more prestigious than others, such as those that may gain recognition for the school through competitions.
However, Mr Ng believes that the grading system is necessary.
“We need some way to measure how we’ve contributed to our schools, and if we do away with this system, some teachers may do less than others because there is no incentive,"" he said, adding that the situation is the same ""as with any other job"". 
For Mandy, what she would like to see is greater transparency in the system. 
“So some of us are left wondering why we are left behind when others are progressing,” she said.
If she could have things her way, Germaine would do away with the grading system entirely. 
Said the veteran teacher: “I want to relive my early days of working together as a school without competing against each other, without being graded, before I retire. We just purely enjoyed teaching our kids.”
To ensure teachers are assessed fairly and consistently across schools, MOE said it provides school leaders with performance management guidelines. 
This allows them to ""strike an appropriate balance between consistency, while still allowing for some flexibility and discretionary judgement to cater to specific circumstances in each school.""
""MOE regularly updates and engages all school leaders on key human resource policies and issues which include performance management policies, good practices and expected standards of performance assessment,"" the ministry added.
MOE also said that teachers who feel they have been unfairly assessed can raise their concerns to their school leaders, cluster superintendents or the ministry's human resource team.
ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTON OF WHAT A TEACHER'S ROLE SHOULD BE 
With teachers being pulled in different directions by the various demands and expectations, it begs the question: What is the role of teachers? 
And this is a question that teachers themselves have difficulty answering. 
Given the amount of time which children spend in school daily, teachers play a big part in their academic, social and emotional growth — serving as role models while teaching them academically.
However, with their job scope growing unabated, the teachers interviewed said that they have had to sacrifice their health — both physical and mental — and time with family to help their students.
When comparing her role as a teacher when she first started 26 years ago, Mabel described the change in job scope as “drastic”.
“In the 1990s, parents would not contact us unless there was an urgent matter… It was a respectable job to be a teacher,” she said.
""Now, we are expected to do everything while not being appreciated
Sandra, the mother tongue teacher, hopes that she can be allowed to focus on teaching. 
“The emphasis on ICT (information and communications technology) has really opened up new avenues to keep our students engaged with their studies, but it’ll only be possible if we have time to craft and innovate new curriculum, and have enough technological resources so children can access it,” she said.

Mr Thiruman, the secretary-general of the teachers' union, noted that as teachers go beyond the call of duty, ""it is all the more vital that there is a curtailing of teachers’ official duties and expectations"".
And in that regard, the school leadership plays an important role. ""Collectively, school leadership plays a pivotal role in school culture, work-life harmony, workload, expectations of teachers as well as shielding teachers from abusive parents and students,"" he said. 
He said that the union collects feedback from teachers regularly through dialogues, surveys and focus group discussions. It also receives daily emails and phone calls from teachers hoping to see improvements to their working conditions.
Ultimately, teachers need more support from school leaders, MOE and parents, he added. 
“To then load them with committee work, non-teaching related duties and meetings as well as constant, non-stop WhatsApp messages from multiple chat groups is unwise and untenable,” he stressed. 
While he applauded MOE’s moves so far to improve teachers' well-being, he hoped that the ministry would introduce more flexi-work arrangements for teachers, so that they can better juggle their personal and professional lives.
While the teachers interviewed have different ideas on what their role as educators should be, they were clear about what they are not — ""babysitters"".
Mandy said: “A lot of administrative work is a result of us having to ‘cover’ ourselves so that the parents have sufficient notice and cannot come back to complain later on. But don’t parents have a responsibility to look after their children?
“More understanding from parents would be appreciated… If parents don’t help their children at home, we can’t change them in school either.”
Looking back on her 25-year teaching career, Ms Loh believes her teaching career has been fruitful despite the ups and downs. 
“I’m pretty laid-back, so students found me chill and would share with me their woes as if I’m their counsellor. But considering how almost half of their day was spent in school, I hope I made an impact somewhere,” she said.
Likewise, despite their heavy workload and the amount of personal sacrifices their job entails, the current teachers whom TODAY spoke to remain undeterred in doing their best to nurture the future generations — but they certainly can do with some help, not least from parents.

"Recovery, construction efforts after Clementi landslide 'may take a few months': Desmond Lee",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/recovery-construction-work-clementi-northarc-bto-landslide-months-desmond-lee-2920331,"SINGAPORE: The recovery and construction efforts to repair the damage caused by the recent landslide in Clementi ""may take a few months"", said National Development Minister Desmond Lee said on Sunday (Sep 4).
This includes removing the dislodged soil in Sungei Ulu Pandan, reinstating the damaged part of the Ulu Pandan park connector and reconstructing the slope and retaining walls within the site, he said in a Facebook post.
The landslide occurred at a construction site for the Clementi NorthArc Build-to-Order (BTO) flats on Friday morning, causing ""soil displacement"" into the canal and damage to the park connector. A passer-by sustained minor injuries. 
Mr Lee said he visited the area with Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann on Sunday afternoon. 
The Housing and Development Board (HDB), National Parks Board (NParks) and national water agency PUB have been ""working round the clock"" over the weekend to carry out ""immediate repair and slope stabilisation recovery works"", Mr Lee said. 
""HDB and the contractors have applied a thin layer of concrete to help stabilise the slope ... (and) created a channel to allow water flow through the canal to mitigate any flood risks upstream,"" he added. 
Mr Lee said more permanent measures to stabilise the slope are being carried out, followed by the ""main recovery and construction efforts, which may take a few months"". 
Engineers from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and HDB, together with the project's Qualified Person -  either an architect or engineer - have inspected surrounding buildings and structures and they remain structurally sound, said Mr Lee. 
He added that BCA, HDB and the Ministry of Manpower are investigating the ""slope failure"". 
""In the meantime, safety remains our priority. We will continue to check the instrument readings deployed within and around the site, to closely monitor structural safety throughout the entire recovery process,"" he said.

POFMA correction direction issued to The Alternative View for implying HDB profits from Ang Mo Kio BTO flats ,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pofma-correction-direction-alternative-view-hdb-bto-flats-central-weave-ang-mo-kio-2920196,"SINGAPORE: Facebook page The Alternative View has been issued a correction direction for suggesting that the Housing & Development Board (HDB) profits from the sale of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats at Central Weave @ AMK. 
The direction was issued under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). 
The case involved a Facebook post three days ago, said the Ministry of National Development (MND) in a news release on Sunday (Sep 3).
In the post, The Alternative View reproduced the headline of an AsiaOne article stating ""Ang Mo Kio BTO flats: Strong demand for 5-room units despite prices of up to $877k"". The post contained an image of the Minister for National Development Desmond Lee holding a bag of money. 
The post also included a caption: ""How much profit is HDB reaping from this?"" 
MND said in its news release: ""Implicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which are part of the August 2022 BTO sales exercise.
""This statement is false."" 
The Alternative View will be required to publish a correction notice and provide access to the correct facts. 
HDB will not profit from the sale of the flats, MND said. 
""In fact, it will incur a loss from this project, as the estimated amount to be collected from the sale is lower than the estimated total development cost of the project. 
""If we take into account the CPF housing grants that HDB will extend to eligible buyers, the deficit is higher still,"" MND said. 
The HDB incurs a deficit every year, MND said, adding that ""the amount HDB collects from the sale of flats in every financial year is less than the costs it incurs, including the total development cost (comprising land cost and construction cost) and CPF housing grants"". 
For the financial year 2021/2022, HDB incurred a deficit of S$3.85 billion in its Homeownership Programme. 
In the last three years, the average deficit incurred by HDB was about S$2.68 billion per year.  
The deficit is mainly due to ""significant subsidies"" for new flats and the disbursement of CPF housing grants for eligible buyers, MND said.  
""Because of this, most first-timer buyers use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their housing loans. 
""Close to 90 per cent of first-timer families service their HDB loans using CPF with little or no cash payments,"" the ministry said. 
The annual deficit is funded by the Government and is reflected in HDB's audited financial statements published every year, MND added."

However, a section of the park connector closer to the incident site in Clementi - the stretch between Boon Lay Way and Clementi Road - remains closed.
This is due to ""ongoing and planned recovery and repair works, and potential flood risks"", said NParks in a Facebook post. 
The park connector beyond this stretch, from Clementi Road to Commonwealth Avenue West, is currently open. 
The landslide occurred at a construction site for the Clementi NorthArc Build-to-Order (BTO) flats on Friday morning.

NParks said it would work with national water agency PUB to ""closely monitor the rain forecast and water level in the canal and will temporarily close the park connector when necessary"". 
In a separate Facebook post on Sunday, PUB urged members of the public to avoid using the Ulu Pandan park connector during heavy rain. 
""Should flooding occur, remain on high ground and avoid walking through floodwaters,"" PUB said.

"Are there sharks in Singapore? Volunteer divers to survey local reefs, document biodiversity",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pulau-hantu-conservation-diving-reefx-marine-biodiversity-singapore-2914356,"SINGAPORE: Dive instructor Amber Soong normally looks for seahorses, fish or sea slugs on her dives, but on one Saturday, she went into the water with a ruler to hunt for coral.
Ms Soong, co-founder of non-profit The Plastic Project, is a volunteer for ReefX - Singapore’s first community-driven project to survey the coral reefs here.
She and dozens of other experienced divers were out at Pulau Hantu on a Saturday afternoon for one of the project’s first expeditions to record and document the marine ecosystem at the local dive site.
Located to the south of Singapore’s main island, Pulau Hantu or “ghost island” is home to Singapore’s most accessible dive sites.
Describing the dive, Ms Soong said that their team of divers had to take photos of the coral from the top and from the side using the ruler to estimate its size. They also needed to take a close-up of the coral polyps to identify the species.

“As a leisure diver, I would look for nudibranchs, look for sharks … (and) for seahorses … honestly, I was so bored,” she laughed.
“I have a huge appreciation and respect for researchers since the last dive, because it is a very meticulous job.”
The divers were not just documenting coral, there were teams taking photos and video of fish, nudibranchs and any other form of marine life.

This first group, many of whom are instructors, divemasters and former naval divers, have extensive diving experience in local waters. They will form the pioneer batch of guides who will train future ReefX volunteers.
UNEXPECTED BIODIVERSITY
A few divers told CNA that they used to go scuba diving overseas, but when borders around the world closed during COVID-19, they discovered a newfound appreciation for Pulau Hantu.
For award-winning photographer Mok Wai Hoe, it was his first dive at Pulau Hantu.
Tasked to take photos of the dive volunteers as they worked, he admitted that he was “apprehensive”, as the visibility in Singapore waters is notoriously poor.
“Poor visibility is the bane of photography and so I was nervous because I was not sure what the conditions were,” he said.
“But the moment I entered the water, I thought: ‘It’s not so bad!’”
Mr Mok, who has dived extensively around the world, said that the biodiversity here was richer than he expected.

The richness of life at Hantu has also surprised Dutch diver and ReefX volunteer Daniel van Wijk, who said that until he moved to Singapore five years ago, he didn’t realise that you could dive the coral reefs here. 
“I didn't know about the phenomenon of a BioBlitz … where people who have a skill, which is scuba diving, could actually participate in such large-scale data collection underwater that will even (contribute) to research initiatives,” he said. “I found that a great idea.”
He was also amazed that there were blacktip sharks here - but before they could be documented in the ReefX database, eight of the sharks were found dead in the waters off Pulau Hantu last week, believed to have been caught in a gill net.

ReefX programme director Andrea Leong said that the project now has an active network of divers, who are able to immediately act on unusual incidents such as the eight dead baby blacktips. 
“The divers, who are Marine Stewards members, alerted us immediately, which we then brought to the attention of the authorities,” she said.
“Now ReefX gives conservation-minded divers the platform to actually be our ‘eyes on the reef’ and take collective action when needed.”
“WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE PROTECTING”
There are about 250 species of coral, and more than 100 species of fish in local waters. 
Before, there have been reef surveys conducted by the National Parks Board and local universities, but ReefX will be the first to engage local dive volunteers in a long-term programme.
There will be two regular dive trips every month, which will allow the project to capture changes at the reefs over time.
Ms Leong said that for the data to be robust, the method of collection has to be consistent, and the data have to be systematically logged.

“All this is done on our ReefX survey dives - with the objective of producing data that is viable for scientists and stakeholders to use when making decisions and policies for our reefs,” she said.
“Just from the August expedition, we have logged a seahorse, pipefish, toadfish, green turtle, blacktip and even cuttlefish eggs which we saw in the same spot two weeks apart.”
While beautiful photos of the colourful creatures at Pulau Hantu’s dive sites can be found online, for survey dives, the volunteers take pictures showing their full anatomy, and upload the photos and details into a database.
These are verified by scientific volunteers for species accuracy and will be useful data for future research.

More than 40 ReefX divers signed up for reef survey training until the end of the year, and 15 land-based volunteers to help with operations and data processing. 
Ms Leong said that Pulau Hantu has been listed as a potential area of development under URA’s 50-year development plan. She noted that Pedra Branca was reclaimed end of last year, and recently it was announced that Changi Bay would be reclaimed too. 
“Pulau Hantu is one of the very last few remaining areas of natural reefs which Singapore has, and its biodiversity is actually comparable to some of the world’s best dive sites. It would be a huge loss for our marine environment if we lost Pulau Hantu,” she said.
“In order for us to protect Pulau Hantu, we need to understand what we are protecting.”
 
After Pulau Hantu, there are plans to add more survey sites, such as Bendera Bay at St John’s Island in collaboration with the Friends of Marine Park."
Daniel Goh says Workers’ Party disciplinary committee formed to investigate his Facebook posts on Raeesah Khan,"The former Non-Constituency Member of Parliament said that he has declined to be interviewed by the committee. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workers-party-daniel-goh-raeesah-khan-facebook-posts-disciplinary-committee-2919626,"SINGAPORE: Workers’ Party (WP) cadre member Daniel Goh said on Saturday (Sep 3) that the party has convened a disciplinary committee to look into his Facebook posts on Raeesah Khan. 
The posts related to how the Workers’ Party handled the “Raeesah Khan matter” in Parliament, he said on Facebook. 
Ms Khan had stepped down in November last year after admitting to lying in Parliament. She was found guilty of abusing parliamentary privilege and fined S$35,000, while party leaders Pritam Singh and Faisal Manap were referred to the public prosecutor after investigations by the Committee of Privileges.
When contacted by CNA, a Workers' Party spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. 
The former Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, who is currently associate provost of undergraduate education at the National University of Singapore, said the committee has called him up for an interview “to hear the reasons and rationale” behind his public statements.
According to Associate Professor Goh, his posts were said to have “revealed the inner workings of the Parliamentary caucus of the WP Members of Parliament"" and allowed their political opponents to ""have an inside understanding of how the WP operates”.
His posts were also said to have “cast a cloud over the character of the leadership of the WP”, he wrote.
Assoc Prof Goh said that he has declined to attend the interview as he has “nothing more to say about the questions that were publicly posted last year”, adding that he has “been clear about the reasons and rationale in those posts”.
“I have not been associated with party matters since I stepped down from my duties in early 2020. My Facebook posts were questions based on public information,” he said.
“The party leadership had not made any special communications with party members on the Raeesah Khan matter. I did not receive any additional information as a cadre member. The party leadership only came forward with more information on their handling of the matter after my posts.” 
When asked by CNA if he intends to remain a member of the Workers’ Party in light of the situation, Assoc Prof Goh said that he sees “no reason to resign” from the party “just because the leadership does not like (his) questioning”.

""CONCERNED CITIZEN""
In his Facebook post, Assoc Prof Goh also said that he had asked those questions as a “concerned citizen” and as a party member who believes that “public accountability and integrity are non-negotiable values demanded of our political leaders”. 
In issues of grave public interest, he said that questions must be asked about the inner workings of any organisation. 
“If asking those questions carry a price, I am willing to pay it, and count it inexpensive,” he wrote. 
Assoc Prof Goh added that he has “no intention” of participating in party matters, including the Cadre Members’ Conference to be held in a few months’ time to elect party leaders. 
“I spent nearly 10 years working alongside many colleagues, building WP up as a credible political party, with the core values of integrity, service, and public accountability,” he said.
“In the same spirit of public accountability, I would ask that the party leaders make public the grounds of their decision and explain any disciplinary sanctions they would impose on me.”
He also said that he disagreed with seeing the Government or any political party as “political opponents”. 
“As opposition politicians working to advance public interest in a field dominated by the ruling party, it is too easy to fall into a cycle of pride and irresponsibility driven by a persecution complex,” he wrote as he concluded his post.
“The Workers’ Party had placed men and women in Parliament because we believed in looking beyond ourselves and the party itself to build a better and more just Singapore. The party must serve Singapore responsibly.”
In April 2020, Assoc Prof Goh stepped down from the WP central executive committee (CEC), citing health reasons.
At the time, WP said he had stepped down from his appointments in the CEC to focus on his rehabilitation, but remained an ordinary member of the CEC.
Assoc Prof Goh was sworn in as a Non-Constituency Member of the 13th Parliament of Singapore on Feb 29, 2015, after fellow WP member Lee Li Lian decided not to take up her NCMP seat. 
He served as an NCMP until Jun 22, 2020, the day before Parliament was dissolved ahead of that year’s General Election."
"AVS seeking views on feline welfare framework, including pet cat ownership in HDB flats","The public consultation includes an online survey that will be available until Nov 2. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pet-cat-hdb-microchip-avs-survey-welfare-framework-public-consultation-2919451,"SINGAPORE: The Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) is seeking public feedback on its proposed framework to improve the management and welfare of cats, including possibly allowing pet cats in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.
In a press release on Saturday (Sep 3), AVS said that the framework aims to safeguard public health, and better protect the health and welfare of Singapore’s pet and community cats. 
The public consultation will run for six months, from September 2022 to March 2023.
This includes a two-month online survey for the public, which is currently available on AVS’ website until Nov 2. 
AVS said it will reach out to key stakeholders, including animal welfare groups, veterinarians, community cat caregivers, cat-owning and non-cat-owning residents, and representatives of pet businesses. 
The agency aims to share the findings of the public consultation exercise and its revised recommendations in 2023.
PET CATS IN HDB FLATS
Members of the public can share their views on the three strategies within the framework.
The first proposal is to expand the existing pet dog licensing and microchipping scheme to include pet cats. 
In addition to improving the traceability of the felines, AVS said microchipping would also allow cat owners to be held accountable for the responsible keeping of their pets. This would mitigate potential issues such as abandonment and associated cat-related feedback.
Microchipping would also allow AVS to trace a pet diagnosed with an infectious disease, helping the agency to react better in the event of a disease outbreak.






      The public consultation for the proposed cat management framework was launched on Sep 3 by Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How. (Photo: Facebook/NParks)
    






With the proposed licensing scheme, the public will be consulted on whether cats are suitable to be kept as pets in public housing, with AVS and HDB also exploring the possibility of allowing pet cats in Housing Board flats.
""We have heard many calls from cat lovers to allow this,"" said Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How on Saturday at a Pets’ Day Out event, through which AVS engages with the pet community.
He added that the authorities recognise that HDB flat residents would like to have cats as pets, while others may have concerns about issues caused by irresponsible cat ownership.
""As we carefully review our pet ownership policies, we will consult the public widely, and continue to balance the needs of the different segments of our community.""
MANAGING CATS IN THE COMMUNITY
The second strategy looks to extend the Trap-Neuter-Rehome/Release-Manage (TNRM) programme for free-roaming dogs to community cats as well. Such cats will be sterilised after capture, and then rehomed where possible or released back into the community.
The proposed TNRM programme for cats would build on the current Stray Cat Sterilisation Programme (SCSP), where AVS works with animal welfare groups to manage the community cat population by subsidising the costs of sterilisation and microchipping. 
AVS is currently conducting research to better understand the population size and ecology of community cats, as well as the social aspects of cat management. 
The findings will be used to refine the proposed cat management framework, including the proposal to extend the programme to community cats, said AVS.
RESPONSIBLE CAT OWNERSHIP
The third strategy would explore ways to further promote responsible cat ownership, the adoption of cats, and responsible community cat caregiving.
""An example is sharing with new pet owners on caring for their pets. Such efforts will help to protect the health and welfare of our pets,"" said AVS.
Mr Tan reassured the public that the authorities will be mindful of existing cat owners’ circumstances, with all new measures carefully studied and gradually implemented.
""All of us have a part to play in encouraging responsible pet ownership and community animal caregiving,"" he said.
The consultation is part of the larger Forward Singapore movement that aims to refresh the country's social compact and ""build a more endearing home"", said AVS.

Channel created in Ulu Pandan Canal to prevent flooding after Clementi BTO landslide,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/water-channel-created-ulu-pandan-canal-flooding-clementi-bto-northarc-landslide-2919221,"SINGAPORE: The authorities have created a channel to allow water to flow through the Ulu Pandan canal after soil was displaced in a landslide at a Clementi Build-to-Order (BTO) project.
Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann posted a video update on Facebook on Saturday (Sep 3) morning after visiting the site, noting that this will help prevent flooding.
The channel is part of ongoing works to mitigate flood risk at the canal, said Ms Sim, who is also the area’s Member of Parliament.
In her post, she thanked the workers, engineers and officers from various agencies – Housing and Development Board (HDB), PUB and the National Parks Board – for working late into the night to create the channel. 
The landslide occurred at about 2am on Friday near the construction site of Clementi NorthArc, causing damage to the Ulu Pandan park connector. A man sustained minor injuries from the incident.

The Building and Construction Authority has issued a stop-work order for the affected location and the area around the site, including the part connector next to it, has been temporarily cordoned off.
In an update on Friday evening, HDB said that the “slope failure” had occurred where a retaining wall was being constructed to prepare for the building of a basketball court and pavilion in the area. 
Besides creating the channel to improve the flow of water through the canal to avoid flooding during heavy rains, the authorities will also apply a thin layer of concrete to stabilise the slope within the site.
PUB added on Friday that its quick response team vehicles are ready to be deployed in case there is flooding upstream of the canal. 
The completion date for Clementi NorthArc was originally supposed to be sometime in the third quarter of this year, but in April buyers were informed that this would be pushed back.
Ms Sim (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah) told reporters on Friday afternoon that according to HDB’s preliminary assessment, there will be no delays to key collection. Buyers would be able to collect their keys in December at the earliest.

Death penalty for drug trafficking is in Singaporeans’ interest: Shanmugam,"Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam stressed that the country's stance on drugs has ""saved lives in Singapore"".
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/death-penalty-drug-trafficking-singaporeans-interest-k-shanmugam-2918591,"SINGAPORE: Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said on Friday (Sep 2) that Singapore’s policy of having the death penalty for drug trafficking is one that is in the interest of Singaporeans.
Mr Shanmugam was responding to a question about how Singapore balances conflicting viewpoints, domestically and internationally, on the issue at a dialogue session with students from the Nanyang Technological University.
“My starting point (is) what is my task as a minister? Do we say we have tough punishment because we want to be tough? Is it because there’s some glory in being tough? None of that,” the minister said.
“From something as mundane as building a road to naming a building to having policies – whether it’s on aviation, healthcare, Budget, to what kind of penalties we have for littering, molesting, rape, murder, drugs. Everything has got to be based on a certain view on what is in the interest of Singaporeans.”
Mr Shanmugam cited a survey done by his ministry among non-Singaporeans from parts of the region, where 83 per cent of the respondents said the death penalty made people not want to traffic substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore.
“If I removed the death penalty, the flow of drugs into Singapore will be much higher. Your lives, your siblings’ lives, many other lives would be at risk. More people will die in Singapore if we removed the death penalty,” he added.
He also mentioned a separate survey by the ministry, which showed nearly 87 per cent of Singaporeans supporting the death penalty.
“So there isn’t a great deal of argument within Singapore. It’s some people who keep repeating the points,” the minister said, before adding that Singapore is not alone in capital punishment laws. The death penalty is also in place in the world’s three largest countries – China, India and the United States.
“All three (countries) have the death penalty so what international practice are you talking to me about?”
Continuing, the minister cited the high-profile case involving convicted Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, who was executed in April after 12 years on death row. The case in Singapore had gained international prominence, with headlines focusing on Nagaenthran’s alleged intellectual disability.
Mr Shanmugam noted how the United States had executed two men with IQ ranges similar to Nagaenthran around the same time that the Malaysian’s final appeal was dismissed.
“Nobody is writing to them. Nobody is complaining,” he said.
“So when we talk about international practice and local pressure, don't fall into this trap that is set by a few people repeating the same points over and over again.""

In his response, the minister also talked about the impact of drugs, citing several examples and statistics such as a World Health Organization report that about 500,000 deaths a year were linked to drug abuse.
“Why are there no questions about that? ... Those lives don’t matter?” Mr Shanmugam asked the audience.
If the death penalty is removed, it is “likely that there will be more drugs” and in turn, more drug-related offences leading to a decline in people’s sense of safety and security. Singapore’s position as an investment centre may also be affected, he added.
But Mr Shanmugam stressed that in Singapore, help is offered to drug abusers “who haven’t committed any other offence”. 
The approach is to treat drug abusers as “people who need help”, and they will not be imprisoned or have a criminal record. Instead, depending on the state of drug taking and frequency, they could be sent to a drug rehabilitation centre or be subject to supervisory orders.
“But when we arrest a drug trafficker, we deal with them very harshly. I am prepared to defend this anywhere, minus all these untruths, statements which are intended to put you in a certain frame of mind, and inaccuracies,” he added.
“Let's deal with facts – have we saved lives in Singapore? ... The answer is yes.”

No doubts that death penalty is the right policy for drug trafficking: Shanmugam













Prior to taking questions from students at the dialogue session which lasted for almost two and a half hours, Mr Shanmugam gave an opening speech where he spoke at length about the internal and external challenges faced by Singapore.
The domestic issues include a “tight balance” that the Government has to strike when it comes to the country’s finances amid the inability to raise taxes while dealing with higher spending needs, a rapidly ageing population in Singapore and income inequality.
The minister also talked about external threats, where he largely emphasised on economic competition.
Mr Shanmugam raised examples to depict competition faced by Singapore’s two key sectors – maritime and aviation. For instance, the former, which supports about 170,000 jobs and accounts for 7 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product, faces challenges such as shifting trade routes and the emergence of newer ports in the region.
He went on to cite a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which estimated regional economies such as Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, to be among the world’s trillion-dollar economies by 2030.
“If all our neighbors are doing extremely well and if they have a full suite of services, then the question is what’s your relevance? 
“We want them to do well but we want to be relevant so the key task is to find a way in which we can continue to be relevant,” he said.
Mr Shanmugam also pointed to new trends brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the trend of remote working.
“The more workers say I want to work from home, the more employers are going to say home doesn't have to be Bishan or Ang Mo Kio. Home can be Bangalore or Shanghai or Manila, where people are prepared to work for one third (or) one quarter (of your salary).
“So what's your value proposition? Why should people invest in Singapore and employ you?” he asked students gathered at Lee Kong Chian Lecture Theatre.
So far, Singapore has “done well” but the minister cautioned that this “is because of the past” and “doesn’t predict the future”. Adding that Singapore has succeeded in building an economy that is “so substantial and so out of proportion to (its) land size and population”, the risk now is “complacency”.
Singapore’s current advantages such as rule of law and zero corruption may be replicated by others, he cautioned, while adding that other countries also have their own edge like the availability of land and cheaper cost of doing business.
“So there are these issues to think about and whether you think in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, we will be able to keep up our relative effectiveness, or whether others will overtake us.”"
IN FOCUS: Danger zones - how workplace safety lapses are costing lives,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has hit some industries in Singapore hard, there are systemic issues behind the recent spate of workplace accidents. Workers and safety consultants share their experiences on the ground working in higher-risk industries such as construction.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/work-workers-safety-wsh-accidents-deaths-mom-focus-2915066,"SINGAPORE: About a year ago, Bangladeshi worker Mohsin was climbing down scaffolding at a renovation site when he fell about 3m.
He was hospitalised for seven days with injuries to his back and hand as well as fractures in his leg. He could not walk for two months, said the worker, who only gave his first name.
It was raining that day and workers were hurrying to get off the scaffolding, he recalled.
“Suddenly rain coming … supervisor say: ‘Raining already, you (come) down, fast, fast, fast, fast’,” Mohsin said. “He is always pushing workers, you know, always he pushing.”
As he quickly climbed down, Mohsin slipped and fell. It took him about nine months to fully recover, then he went home for a break before returning to Singapore to work.
Such situations, where supervisors and workers act under time pressure, have been cited as one of the causes of workplace accidents, which have been on the rise in Singapore.

Two more workplace fatalities, including worker hit by forklift at Kranji Water Reclamation Plant













As of Aug 31, 36 workers have died on the job, compared with 37 deaths for the whole of 2021 and 39 in 2019. In 2020, there were 30 deaths, a lower figure as construction work was suspended during the “circuit breaker” period.
On Thursday (Sep 1), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) pushed out a new slate of measures to boost workplace health and safety (WSH), and announced a state of “heightened safety” for the next six months.
From now until Feb 28, 2023, if the ministry uncovers serious safety lapses following severe or fatal workplace accidents, it will ban the companies involved from hiring new foreign workers for up to three months. All companies in higher-risk sectors are required to conduct a mandatory safety time-out to review safety procedures by Sep 15.
The demerit point system for the construction sector will also be revised so that the threshold for getting demerit points will be lowered. Once the penalty threshold is reached, the company can be barred from hiring foreign workers for up to two years.

Companies ordered to conduct mandatory time-out to review safety procedures amid uptick in workplace fatalities and injuries

These and other measures come on top of stepped-up inspections and higher fines that were introduced in April.
MOM warned especially about working at heights without proper safety protection, which was the most common workplace safety contravention found during its inspections.
Falling from heights is also the top cause of workplace deaths this year, like other years.
POST COVID-19 SPIKE
What’s different this year is that after the pandemic, as COVID-19 restrictions ease, projects have come back online, but many foreign workers, heavily employed in construction and manufacturing, have returned to their home countries - meaning that there’s more work but fewer workers.

Labour woes, tighter deadlines due to COVID-19 contributing to workplace deaths: Industry players, experts













Before the recent spate of deaths, the workplace fatality rate had fallen to 1.1 per 100,000 workers in 2021, from 2.1 per 100,000 in 2012.
Workplace accidents also spiked after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, said safety consultant Goh Chye Guan, who had expected this post-pandemic spike in injuries and deaths at work.
“For two-and-a-half years, we stopped work, so there are a lot of things that can go wrong.”
For example, machines may not have been used or maintained, chemicals and materials could have expired and workers may be out of practice, he said.
But he also said that the accidents that occurred this year are “nothing unusual” in that the incidents result from the safety issues that have cropped up frequently in the past.
This points to systemic issues that have been exacerbated by cost pressure, tighter deadlines and the manpower crunch on the ground.




















Executive director of the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) Bernard Menon called these conditions a “perfect storm”.
“You have looming project deadlines, as a result, workers work overtime,” he said.
“Migrant workers are such that if you get the opportunity to work overtime and earn more money, most migrant workers would take that opportunity, willingly. 
“But I think there's a downside to that. They work for too long hours, it's very, very easy to lose focus … in many instances, as we can see, (this has) led to tragic consequences.”  
“WHEN CAN YOU FINISH?”
Mr Yong Jian Rong, chairman of the WSH subcommittee of the Singapore Contractors’ Association Limited, said that in Singapore, safety culture is not embraced consistently by all, and safety is often overtaken by other priorities. 
“Often, the question you hear being asked to the contractor is ‘When can you finish?’, rather than ‘What are the steps that you have taken to ensure this is done safely?’"" he said. 
“The contractor is expected to work safely at all times but is not always rewarded when things are done in a safe manner.”
However, if the work is delayed, there is a high chance that penalties could be imposed on them, he said.
This can translate to managers pressuring supervisors, supervisors rushing workers, and workers themselves not taking safety seriously, so as to expedite the work.

Mr Colin Seah, safety consultant at QE Safety, who has been in the industry for more than 10 years, gave one example: He has asked workers to erect barriers at work sites to prevent falls, only to have them removed later, sometimes the very day they were put up.
When he asked them why, the answer could be that the barricade got in the way, as construction materials are being moved up to the higher floor through that access point.
Contractors and construction supervisors have told him that Singapore works on an “Asian schedule” - everything has to be fast, but wants Western standards of safety at the same time.
Expressing the frustration he feels at times as a safety specialist, he said: “There’s a problem - we solve it, but sometimes our hands are tied.”
There can be many underlying reasons for taking shortcuts, he said, ranging from time pressure, lack of manpower or experience, to inadequate resources - as safety gear can be expensive.
NEW, INEXPERIENCED WORKERS
Mr Yong pointed out that Singapore’s workforce in the construction sector is largely made up of foreign labour that constantly rotates every couple of years. 
“This makes training very tedious due to the sheer amount of repetition that has to be done on a daily basis,” he said.
Experienced workers CNA spoke to said that new workmates tend not to be so aware of safety, even if they have been trained. Part of the reason is that they have so much to absorb and learn that they lack the bandwidth to also think about safety.
Mr Hasan Samim, an electrical and instrumental technician and site safety supervisor with Rotary Engineering, said he has seen more new and inexperienced workers coming to Singapore after borders reopened.
“There are a lot of new people, inexperienced people coming in for work currently … they don't have enough experience or knowledge to protect themselves or protect others,” he said.
“When you are new, you are also scared to do something - scared to take precautions, scared to talk also.”
Besides giving them daily briefings on safety, he groups experienced workers with inexperienced workers into teams so that the ones with experience can watch over the new workers, he said.

IN FOCUS: Feeling the heat? Why it will get even hotter, and what we can do about it













Mr Omar Sakib, a safety supervisor, said that workers on the job for long hours, especially in the sun, can also result in injury.
He recounted how, about two months ago, a worker fainted from heat stroke while paving the road with asphalt. The machine he was using to level the road then ran over his foot. Supervisors need to properly manage the workers’ shifts to manage their fatigue, he said.
FEAR OF SPEAKING UP
Mustafa, a worker who was injured a few months ago after falling about 2m, told CNA that his company, a small construction firm, was constantly short of manpower and pressuring the workers to meet deadlines.
The Bangladeshi worker, who did not want to use his real name, said that the day he fell, there were three of them at the site, and they climbed up to the roof of the house using a ladder they leaned against the wall.
He supported the ladder while his co-workers climbed up, but had no one to help him hold the ladder, which slipped as he was climbing it. Besides the fact that there were not enough workers on site, using an unsecured ladder to climb up to the rooftop was also unsafe.
Mustafa said that while he sees safety harnesses at the company’s office, they were not distributed to the workers, and not used.
He said: “Every time, (they) give less workers and rush to do fast … your safety - follow or not follow, it doesn't matter.”
He knew that these practices were unsafe but did not feel that he could speak up. 






      The A-frame ladder was not used correctly - a secured step ladder or monkey ladder with proper handholds should be used instead, said the Manpower Ministry. (Photo: MOM)

    






Mustafa returned to Bangladesh for a break just before the COVID-19 pandemic, then for two years, he couldn’t come back to Singapore to work as there were border restrictions.
Having run out of money, he wanted to come to Singapore as quickly as possible and took up any job that was available. He also paid more than S$4,000 in recruitment fees just to come here and work.
He said that if he had reported his employer, he would have been sent back home. “I have a lot of money I loan, so if I go back, the money how do I pay?” he asked. But now that he has injured his leg, he may not be able to do hard labour at all in the future.
Mr Luke Tan, case manager at the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), said that employers hold a lot of power over migrant workers because the recruitment costs are high and the workers go into debt to work here.
“The more costs they incur, the more fear they will have,” he said.
Mr Tan said that many companies took on too many projects or tried to cut costs by hiring too few workers and skimping on safety measures even before COVID-19. He feels that it should cost the companies more to violate safety regulations, as human lives are at stake.
“We hope that instead of some administrative punishments, the authorities could consider more severe, stern actions for employers who are found to be not complying with safety rules.”
SAVING COSTS, LACK OF EQUIPMENT
Similar to what Mustafa described, at times, the workers want to be safe but don’t have the resources to do so.
Workplace safety experts CNA talked to said that safety starts from the planning and budgeting stage, and sometimes, it’s too late by the time inspections come around.
Experienced safety consultant Han Wenqi said that in his years in the industry, he has often come across situations where managers and supervisors tell him that the developer never budgeted for the safety precautions he thinks are necessary.
There are times when workers are wearing safety harnesses, but these are not connected to a lifeline, or the lifelines are hooked to a point that won’t support the worker’s weight. The workers are still at risk of falling “just with an extra full-body harness”, he said, adding that this “goes back to time and money”.
Not only is the safety equipment expensive, anchor points for the lifelines should be installed by professional engineers after making the necessary calculations, he said. But some work sites skip this step.
“They will control the expenditure by forgoing the safety provision or not even having a safety provision,” he said. He thinks this is linked to how projects are often awarded to the lowest bidder.

Workplace safety breaches double to more than 9,000 in first six months of 2022: MOM













To counter this, he and other safety consultants suggest that all projects should have safety specifications stipulated in the tender documents. 
Experts said that government projects tend to come with such specifications, while it varies for private projects. But it should be applied consistently to all construction tenders, so that the costs for safety equipment and precautions are included in the budget.
“If I were to give you a set of 50 pages of very in-depth and specific safety and health requirements versus a sentence: The successful bidder should comply with all the local, legal and other requirements. (There is a) big difference in between,” said Mr Han. 
HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY
Another way to watch over the workers is with the help of technology - something which the authorities are pushing for.
In an adjournment motion on keeping workers and workplaces safe tabled in Parliament on Aug 1, MP Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) said that Singapore should leverage technology to detect and prevent workplace accidents. 
Sensors and wearables can alert management when a worker deviates into a restricted area, or when a worker slips, trips or falls, allowing medical help to be dispatched quickly, said Mr Yong, who is also the assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). Big data and predictive analytics provide the potential of predicting accidents before they even happen, he added.
Invigilo is one company that is equipping companies with equipment and video analytics for workplace safety, and founder Vishnu Saran said that more enquiries are coming in from contractors for their products.
“The key thing is we want to provide complete coverage and continuous monitoring,” said Mr Saran.
“Secondly, what we’re doing with AI is to detect when these unsafe conditions or acts occur before they result in an accident.”

For example, many accidents involve falls from heights and workers being crushed by machines, so Invigilo’s technology can detect the absence of safety harnesses and barricades, and proximity to machines.
The safety manager gets an alert when these scenarios are triggered, and he can then correct the unsafe conditions before the accident happens, said Mr Saran.
Mr Goh, who is a consultant for Invigilo, said that a worker who was crushed by a crane could have been using the vehicle unsafely multiple times a day, every day, without incident for months. But it takes just one slip on an “unlucky day” for him to lose his life.
“But if you can see the trend that he's doing this work (unsafely), then you can predict the accident,” he said.
This is why some companies report “near-miss” incidents - where an unsafe act could have resulted in an accident. And now, CCTVs and AI can take over that role, said Mr Goh.
But that does not take the place of human responsibility.
MINDSETS AND ATTITUDES
Mr Lim Boon Khoon, principal consultant at Hazard Evaluation and Loss Prevention Consultants, said accidents happen because of human failure, which is linked to the workers’ and management’s attitude to safety.
“It is the attitude that shapes the behaviour of the people. And if you have bad behaviour, if you have poor attitude, accidents are likely to happen,” he said.
Safety training needs to go beyond theory and the technical aspects of accident prevention to identifying behaviour that endangers the workers, he said.
This sort of “behaviour-based training” requires workers to go back to their work sites and apply what they’ve learned to their daily work, he explained.





      What happens after a workplace accident?
  

The Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) said that it assists workers and employers on a no-fault basis after an accident.
This is an example of what happened after an industrial accident where a fire broke out, resulting in the deaths of three migrant workers and injuring many others.
First Response:
As there were two companies involving two separate employers, MWC first contacted both employers to offer assistance and guide them in seeing to the urgent needs of the casualties. 
This included advising them on signing the Letter of Guarantee required by the hospital to ensure medical attention and overseeing the safety of other workers on the premises.
MWC worked with the employer to notify the next-of-kin of the affected workers so that they were reassured that the employers are doing the needful.
Employer:
As the employer was overwhelmed with critical matters surrounding the incident such as assisting authorities with the investigation, MWC continued to provide additional support and guidance wherever possible, including advising the employer on the work-injury compensation process and how to submit the necessary documents.
MWC also provided a list of undertakers to help with bereavement and funeral rites, and guided the employer in the process to repatriate the remains.
Workers:
MWC and key representatives from NTUC visited the five workers warded in ICU to reassure them that their needs were being looked into and that the hospital would help arrange video calls with their families.
It also visited the nine uninjured workers who were housed at a temporary site to update them on the medical conditions of their co-workers. It also provided them with some essential items and daily necessities, as their personal belongings were damaged or lost in the fire.
Partnering with HealthServe, MWC also offered counselling services to the workers.
The organisation remained in close contact with the next-of-kin of the three deceased workers and updated them on what was being done. At the same time, it guided them in furnishing the documents that were required for the ex-gratia pay-out. 
The Migrant Workers’ Assistance Fund also sent a token sum to the next-of-kin to help tide them through.
Since the incident, MWC said it has been periodically checking on the well-being of the recovering workers. Case officers continued to provide support to the victims, employer and next-of-kin, including ensuring that they received the compensation pay-out.

Other experts emphasised that attitudes stem from the very top - the company management has to take safety seriously, and they have to make this very clear to all the workers.
Besides introducing stiffer penalties for errant companies, MOM has said it will continue to hold companies as well as company leaders, supervisors and workers responsible for workplace accidents.
It is developing a code of practices for company directors' WSH duties, to provide clarity and practical guidance on how they can fulfil their legal obligations. This is now available for public consultation until Sep 8.
“The ones who are giving the resources and structure to the whole project are the developer and the main contractor, the management. Therefore, there has to be some accountability at that level … It sets the tone for the rest of development,” said Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad at a safety forum organised by the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore on Aug 25. 
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT
There are also existing measures for positive reinforcement, something which safety consultant Mr Goh emphasised.
“If you want someone to do something, you don't just punish him … he will just play a ‘cat-and-mouse’ game with you. But if you reward him for doing good, then he will want to do good,” said Mr Goh.
He pointed to programmes like BizSafe which help companies build workplace safety and health capabilities. BizSafe certification is a requirement for larger-scale contracts and tenders.
Said Mr Goh: “I would suggest the (workplace health and safety) council revisit these programme and see if programmes like BizSafe, CultureSafe should be revitalised.” 
Mr Allen Tan, founder of United Tec Construction, a specialist prefabricated construction contractor with about 700 workers, agreed that it is better to motivate workers to want to be safe, than to take a purely punitive approach.
“Why don’t we encourage, motivate, give some incentives to people along the value chain … We need to cultivate a positive mind so that they can be motivated and take action,” he said.
His company ran competitions on safety performance between teams of workers and he gave his workers incentives like cash prizes or grocery vouchers.

Developers urged to pay contractors safety bonus as workplace accidents rise













MWC’s Mr Menon said that making safety part of workplace culture takes effort from everyone.
Besides making sure that workers are trained and well-rested, employers should implement a safe and easy reporting channel for unsafe workplace practices, he suggested.
This extends to developers and main contractors, who may need to be a bit more “understanding” about deadlines and penalties when there are extenuating circumstances like a shortage of workers, he said.
“You should not lose sight of the fact that the moment you drive people on deadlines, you increase the possibility of extra accidents occurring.”

CNA Explains: Why is it against the law for Singaporeans and PRs to take drugs overseas?,"It was not always illegal for Singaporeans to consume drugs overseas. The law covering drug consumption overseas was passed in 1998 to plug the ""loophole"".
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cannabis-drug-laws-outside-singapore-hair-test-cna-explains-2916026,"SINGAPORE: If you did not already know, taking drugs overseas – whether it is in Phuket or Ibiza – may get you arrested for drug consumption upon your return to Singapore. 
Olympic swimming champion Joseph Schooling, 27, made headlines recently after confessing to consuming cannabis while overseas in May.
Fellow national swimmer Amanda Lim, 29, was also investigated for cannabis use. Urine samples from both tested negative but the pair admitted to having taken drugs in the past, officials and agencies said.
While comments on the case were split between sympathy and calls for fair treatment, others asked why a resident's criminal act overseas could be prosecuted in Singapore.
CNA speaks to lawyers about the extraterritorial nature of Singapore's drug laws.

When and why did Singapore close this ""loophole""? 
While Singapore's laws generally do not apply to residents who commit crimes overseas, certain laws, including the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, have an extraterritorial nature. That is, they apply to Singaporeans and permanent residents who offend overseas. 
Under the Act, Section 8A states that a citizen or permanent resident who consumes drugs overseas ""may be dealt with as if that offence had been committed within Singapore"". 
Speaking in Parliament during the second reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill on Jun 1, 1998, then-Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said the Government needed to plug the ""loophole"".
More Singaporeans were consuming drugs when travelling, with the number of people testing positive for drugs at checkpoints rising 26 per cent from 1994 to 1997, Mr Wong said.
At that time, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) could not charge those who used drugs overseas, even if they tested positive at immigration entry points. 
""With more Singaporeans travelling overseas, the easy access of drugs nearby in neighbouring countries and the proposed harsher penalties for hardcore addicts, it is prudent to plug this loophole,"" said Mr Wong. 
""Otherwise, local addicts would intentionally make trips out of Singapore to neighbouring countries to get their fixes to avoid arrest and prosecution in Singapore, and to make a mockery of our drug laws.""
The provision came into effect on Jul 20, 1998, and states that a person found to have smoked, administered to himself or consumed a controlled or specified drug - whether outside or within Singapore - through a urine test will be dealt with as if the offence had been committed in Singapore. 
The law was applied in the case of DJ Debbie Valerie Tenashar Long who consumed drugs during a trip to Amsterdam. 
Long was arrested at the arrival hall of Changi Airport Terminal 1 on Oct 28, 2015, and her urine sample was found to have contained traces of drugs. 
Aside from drugs, corruption is another offence for which Singaporeans can be prosecuted even if committed overseas, under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960. 
Other statutes, such as the Securities and Futures Act 2001, the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act 2021, and the Passports Act 2007, also have extraterritorial aspects.
Lawyer Amarjit Singh Sidhu from Amarjit Sidhu Law Corporation also pointed out that under the Penal Code, commercial sex with a minor below 18 outside Singapore is an offence. 
The Penal Code also covers facilitating tours outside of Singapore for commercial sex with a minor under 18.

Besides urine tests, are there other ways the authorities can test for drug use? 
Other methods, such as a hair test, can be used to test for drug consumption.
CNB began using hair tests in 2013 to detect drug users. A positive result can be obtained from hair samples, even months after drug use.
But while a positive hair test can be used as evidence in court against those who used drugs locally, it cannot be used to prosecute a person returning from abroad, said Mr Wilson Foo of Fervent Chambers.
Mr Foo said this may be because drugs stay in the hair for a longer time, and may not be able to show whether a person has taken drugs recently. 
A positive result from a hair test would be ""primary evidence that the subject has consumed a prohibited substance"" such as cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine and opiates, said lawyer Shashi Nathan from Withers KhattarWong.
Hair tests are rarely used in evidence but could be a useful investigative reference for the CNB, Mr Nathan said. Likewise, Mr Sidhu has not encountered a drug trial where the prosecution adduced hair evidence.
""A subject would have to explain or give reasons as to why there is a positive result,"" Mr Nathan said. 
How will those found to have been taking drugs overseas be punished?
""The authorities have the discretion not to charge first offenders or young offenders for consumption and may refer them to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for rehabilitation,"" Mr Nathan said.
He added that the authorities might opt to put the offender under a supervised urine test regime, like Schooling was. ""This would give the subject the opportunity to show that the consumption was a one-off and that there are no addiction issues.""
The decision to charge or issue a warning to potential offenders is at the prosecuting authority's discretion, said Mr Foo. 
""The authorities can consider factors such as previous warnings given, DRC admissions, criminal records or compassionate grounds.""

Hand Flower Brand Soy Sauce from Malaysia recalled over presence of benzoic acid: SFA,"The use of the food additive was also not declared on the product's packaging label. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/soy-sauce-recall-hand-flower-brand-malaysia-benzoic-acid-sfa-2918411,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has ordered the recall of Hand Flower Brand Soy Sauce due to the presence of benzoic acid, which is a food additive. 
The agency said in a media release on Friday (Sep 2) that it detected benzoic acid in the implicated product, at levels exceeding the regulatory limit for sauces stated in the Singapore Food Regulations. 
The use of benzoic acid was also not declared on the food packaging label.
As a precautionary measure, SFA said it has directed the importer, Heng Yoon Trading, to recall the implicated product. The recall is ongoing.
The recall affects all Hand Flower Brand Soy Sauce with the batch number KSS0 125 and the best-before date of Jul 26, 2025. The product's country of origin is Malaysia. 
""Under the Singapore Food Regulations, only permitted food additives with levels within the maximum levels are allowed for use in food,"" said SFA.
SFA added that based on the levels of benzoic acid detected, one-off consumption of the affected product is unlikely to be of food safety concern.
""Consumers should not consume food containing high levels of benzoic acid over a long period of time.
""This is because even though benzoic acid is a common additive which is safe when used in small quantities, studies in animals fed with high doses of benzoic acid have shown disorder of the central nervous system as well as changes in their brains,"" said the agency. 
Those who have consumed the implicated product and have concerns about their health should seek medical advice. Consumers may also contact their point of purchase for enquiries.

Singapore reports first Zika case since March 2020,"The virus is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, similar to dengue.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/zika-first-case-march-2020-moh-dengue-aedes-mosquito-cluster-nea-2918186,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has reported its first Zika case since March 2020.
The case was reported during the week of Aug 21 to Aug 27 this year, according to the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) latest weekly infectious diseases bulletin.
In response to CNA's queries, the Health Ministry said on Sunday (Sep 4) that it was informed of the imported case on Aug 22.
The patient has since recovered, it added.
While the case’s residence was not an active dengue cluster, MOH said inspections to remove mosquito breeding habitats and fogging to kill adult mosquitoes were conducted around the location to reduce the likelihood of local Zika transmission.
National Environment Agency (NEA) data showed that 666 dengue cases were also reported during the same week. 
Zika virus infection is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, similar to dengue. There were 194 active dengue clusters in Singapore as of Aug 29 this year. 
The NEA website also showed that 75 dengue clusters are currently identified as “red”, indicating that each cluster has 10 or more cases. 
There is presently no active Zika cluster as of Friday.
MOSQUITO POPULATION
The Aedes aegypti mosquito population, which is the primary dengue vector, remained high in Singapore in July this year. 
“The high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, together with circulation of the previously uncommon DENV-3, will likely lead to dengue case numbers remaining high in the coming months,” said the agency. 
According to the MOH website, only about one in five Zika infections are symptomatic. 
“Zika is generally a mild and self-limiting illness. Although rare, serious neurological complications and foetal abnormalities have been associated with Zika virus infection,” said the ministry, adding that there is no vaccine or specific anti-viral drugs for the virus. 
Those who develop symptoms may experience fever, rash, joint pain, muscle pain, headache as well as conjunctivitis or red eyes. 
Symptoms usually appear within three to 12 days of being bitten by an infected Aedes mosquito and can last between four and seven days. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika outbreak a public health emergency in February 2016. The emergency declaration was lifted in November the same year.
Singapore reported its very first imported case of Zika in May 2016, and the first locally transmitted case came a few months later in August. By the end of that year, more than 450 people had been infected.
In 2017, there were 67 confirmed cases of Zika, of which three were imported. One case was reported in 2018 while there were 12 cases in 2019, according to MOH data. 
The virus has been associated with neurological diseases such as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with a smaller head due to abnormalities in the development of the brain.
Although the Zika virus is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, the WHO said it can also be transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and organ transplantation.

MOH to provide additional support for cancer patients affected by changes to treatment claim policies,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moh-cancer-patient-support-policy-changes-medishield-life-medisave-integrated-shield-plan-2917876,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Friday (Sep 2) additional transitional support for cancer patients who are affected by changes to treatment claim policies that took effect on Thursday.
In August last year, MOH announced changes to the MediShield Life, MediSave and Integrated Shield Plan (IP) coverage, as well as established a Cancer Drug List (CDL).
Under the changes, which took effect on Thursday, only treatments that are listed on the CDL are covered under MediShield Life and MediSave. IP coverage will also be adjusted from Apr 1, 2023, upon policy purchase or renewal.
Cancer drug spending grew 20 per cent per year from 2016 to 2019, said MOH, adding that this was ""not sustainable"". The changes were made to address this issue.
MOH has also extended drug subsidies through the Medication Assistance Fund to more Singapore residents at public healthcare institutions. This will help improve the affordability of clinically and cost-effective cancer drugs, it said.
Currently, more than 90 per cent of cancer treatments approved by the Health Sciences Authority are on the CDL. This will continue to expand as the ministry continues to engage drug companies and as new clinical evidence emerges.
SUPPORT DURING TRANSITION PERIOD
Patients in public and private healthcare institutions who started treatments that are not on the CDL, or are on the CDL but not subsidised before Sep 1, may find themselves affected by the policy change, said MOH.
Out-of-pocket expenses may go up, until the drugs are included or subsidised on the CDL.
""We will provide additional support for this group of patients during this transition period so that their ongoing course of treatment is not disrupted,"" said MOH.
Patients with IPs that currently cover their treatments will not see any change to their coverage from Sep 1, as the changes to IPs will only kick in on their policy renewal date from Apr 1 next year. 
Additionally, all IP insurers have committed to providing support during this transitional period to policyholders undergoing cancer drug treatments beyond Apr 1, 2023. 
Patients with MediShield Life only will receive additional financial support for their current course of treatment. 
""Generally, they will not need to pay more cash as compared to before,"" said MOH, adding that patients may approach their respective public healthcare institutions for more details. 
Those who are receiving private care and need further financial assistance may also request to be directly referred to subsidised specialist care at public healthcare institutions, where their treatment plan will be reviewed and they can apply for additional financial support.

FAQ: What cancer patients need to know about changes to treatment claims under MediShield Life



















Measures to be put in place for cancer patients affected by changes to treatment claim policies: MOH













At a dinner hosted by the Singapore Cancer Society on Friday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said he hoped that with the changes, effective cancer treatments can be made more accessible and affordable to all future patients.
""But there will be mid-flight patients, meaning those who are in the middle of their treatment, using cancer drugs not on the CDL,"" he said.
""So we should avoid the situation where they will find the cost of their cancer drugs shoot up suddenly. We should make provisions, so that the impact on them should be minimal, if not zero.""
The additional support for these patients will allow them to complete their treatment with minimal or no impact to their out-of-pocket expenses after MediSave withdrawals and MediShield Life claims, said Mr Ong.
If these patients have IPs, insurers have committed to continue their current IP coverage at least until September next year, he added.
The Life Insurance Association announced on Friday that all seven insurers offering IP will provide additional support for policyholders amid the implementation of the CDL.
They will keep premium rates for IPs steady from Friday to Aug 31, 2024, although this will not apply to IP riders.
The insurers will also provide transitional support until Sep 30, 2023, for patients whose IPs are renewing between Apr 1, 2023 and Sep 30, 2023, and are actively undergoing cancer drug treatments as of Mar 31, 2023.
""This transitional support will provide affected IP policyholders more time to deliberate on their treatment plans and adjust to the change by switching to suitable alternatives on the CDL, where appropriate,"" said the Life Insurance Association.
""It is critical that treatment decisions are made only upon adequate consultation and discussions with doctors on the way forward. Policyholders are also encouraged to engage their IP insurers to seek clarifications, if required, before commencing treatments.""
Future patients, together with their oncologists, should consider treatment options on the CDL, which are ""clinically proven and more cost effective"", before considering alternatives, said MOH.
""Notwithstanding, IP insurers have decided that their riders’ coverage will continue to cover treatments beyond the CDL,"" said MOH, adding that this will provide greater choice for those who prefer and wish to pay for broader coverage."

Former Sri Lanka president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to return home, says defence official
Bankrupt Sri Lanka's deposed former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa is expected to end his self-imposed exile in Thailand and return home imminently. The 73-year-old fled the island under military escort in July after unarmed crowds stormed his official residence.
Police deployed plainclothes officers and armed guards outside a government residence allocated to Rajapaksa in Colombo on Friday. Security at his private home was also stepped up.
Rights activists said they ""welcome his decision to return"" and would press for Rajapaksa's arrest over a series of crimes, including his alleged role in the 2009 assassination of prominent newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi sentenced to 3 more years in jail, hard labour for election fraud
Myanmar's deposed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been found guilty of electoral fraud, a source says. She was sentenced to three years in jail with hard labour, the source said. The source added it was unclear what hard labour would entail.
She was judged to have committed fraud in a November 2020 general election that her National League for Democracy (NLD) won with an overwhelming legislative majority. Co-defendant Win Myint, the deposed president, received the same sentence.
Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained since a coup early last year and has already been sentenced to more than 17 years in prison. She denies all the allegations against her.

Kai Kai and Jia Jia arrived in Singapore from China in 2012 under a 10-year agreement. They were due to return this year. Their first panda cub Le Le was born on Aug 14 last year and is set to return to China when it reaches independence at two years old. 
NSman fighter pilot clocks almost 40 in-camp training days a year, says family and employer support is important
Major (NS) Robin Chew, 43, is not your average operationally-ready national serviceman (NSman).

"NSman fighter pilot clocks almost 40 in-camp training days a year, says family and employer support is important",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rsaf-exercise-pitch-black-nsmen-fighter-pilots-training-2917126,"DARWIN: Major (NS) Robin Chew, 43, is not your average operationally-ready national serviceman (NSman).
While many NSmen chalk up around 14 days of in-camp training (ICT) a year, MAJ (NS) Chew completes close to 40 days - the maximum allowed without a signed agreement with an employer.
NSmen are notified three months in advance for ICTs shorter than six days in duration, but MAJ (NS) Chew can be called up with far shorter notice. In fact, he goes for a one-day ICT an average of once every two weeks.
And while many NSmen spend their ICTs in a camp, MAJ (NS) Chew does it in the air - in an F-15SG fighter jet to be exact.

A first look at how RSAF’s upcoming F-35 fighter jets will be refuelled mid-air



















‘Rigorous evaluation’ on F-35 continues as Singapore’s defence needs evolve: RSAF













MAJ (NS) Chew was speaking to reporters on Thursday (Sep 1) on the sidelines of Exercise Pitch Black in Darwin, his third voluntary stint at the multi-nation air combat exercise.
He chose to participate in the exercise - involving up to 100 aircraft from 17 countries - for the “better” training opportunities, pointing to the larger training area and the chance to test himself against foreign air forces.

“NS is not just about showing numbers. We are going to be a credible force out there, so we need to be able to come here and upkeep our skills,” he said.
“It’s not just me. I mean, we have different NSmen cycling through the exercises that we do overseas all the time.”
""HECTIC"" COMMITMENT
But this opportunity comes at a price. The father of two said he will be away from home for two-and-a-half weeks, something that would not have been possible without the support of his family and employer.
""Without their support, it’s very hard to get overseas,” he said.
In Singapore, he reports to an air base once every fortnight to fly a sortie and keep his skills current. Then he goes home for the day. 
“The commitment is, on a usual year, we are doing near to 40 days (of ICT) - near to the limit - just because of our requirements for currencies and all that,” he said, referring to the prerequisites pilots have to meet to continue flying.
“If you put it to a day, it’s probably like every two weeks I go back at least once, just to keep my currency going as well. Sounds like a lot, right?” he added with a laugh.

But MAJ (NS) Chew said his children - his daughter and son are 14 and 11 years old respectively - are fine with the frequency of his local ICTs.
“We still go back to base and then we still go home at the end of the day. It’s not like we’re away per se. So it’s not as bad as exercises like this when we are away for two or three weeks,” he said.
MAJ (NS) Chew said his employer has no problem with his ICT schedule as well. He left the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) in 2013 and now works as an outsourced F-15SG flight simulator instructor.
“Currently with my immediate bosses, there’s no issues because we also work closely with the squadron. So, we know how the schedule is going to work,” he said.
However, he acknowledged that there could be issues with his “hectic” ICT commitments if he switched jobs. “That really depends on employers,” he said.

RSAF to fly F-16 fighter jets for 'at least' another decade, following F-35 developments 'closely': Air force chief













GIVING BACK
MAJ (NS) Chew said it is “not that rare” to come across NSmen pilots or air crew, adding that only a minority of regulars stay on until they are 50 years, the mandatory retirement age. One of the F-16 pilots who flew at this year’s National Day Parade is also an NSman.
“My current job is like still in but not in, you know, so it's actually a pretty good mix,” he said of his decision to leave the force.
“And I'm still contributing back to the system itself, teaching what I know back to the younger folks so that they have the experience as well.”

That is not to say MAJ (NS) Chew does not have more to learn.
He described his experience at Exercise Pitch Black as “very interesting”, saying that he had the chance to fly with different air forces and types of planes, including the US and Australian F-35 fighter jets making their debut at the exercise.
“Obviously the F-35s are the new kids on the block,” he said of the fifth-generation stealth fighters that the RSAF will buy. “Everyone's looking at them and seeing how their capabilities are, which is pretty impressive right now.”
According to MAJ (NS) Chew, a typical day at the exercise is usually 12 hours long, including “many hours” planning for a large-scale mission involving all countries, and a three-hour debrief after the fighters land.

In fact, before the interview, he had just landed after flying a three-hour mission on the F-15SG. Recounting the mission, he said he took off, refuelled with an RSAF tanker and then played the “enemy” against the F-35 and other fighters. 
“We got the gas and just trucked south and waited for the 'good guys' to start marshalling, and then we had the fight going on,” he said.
“So the exercise got on, and we did like a 3.2-hour flight, so that's almost as good as going back home (to Singapore). In fact, we can go back home in a shorter time,” he added with another laugh.
TAKING ON THE F-35
MAJ (NS) Chew said it was hard to win as the “bad guy”, joking that it was “just like the movies”. On a more serious note, he praised the F-35s and their ""great"" their stealth capability.
“The sensors and integration help a lot in their awareness and how they can get shots in there. Can’t go into too many specifics, I guess,"" he added. ""But it's (the F-35's capabilities) good.""

When MAJ (NS) Chew was asked if his skills were as good as those of regular RSAF fighter pilots, he replied with a chuckle: “I would like to say yes.”
“It won't be that hard to go back up to that state, but obviously there'll be some bad stuff. I won't say we are as good as the regulars, but obviously there will be some work up required,” he said.
MAJ (NS) Chew reiterated that it is important for NSmen to continue honing their skills, repeating an earlier message.
“It's not just being there as a number, but being credible as a force. So, we definitely need to keep our skill level up for this,” he added.Editor's note: A previous version of this article said that Robin Chew is an F-16 simulator instructor. It should have said F-15. We apologise for the error."
Eye in the sky: The RSAF early warning plane helping fighter jets see farther,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rsaf-exercise-pitch-black-early-warning-plane-g550-2917111,"DARWIN: As Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) fighter jets take to the sky, they know they can rely on an extra set of “eyes” to help them sense danger well ahead of time.
The eyes refer to the Gulfstream 550 airborne early warning aircraft, a regular-looking plane - Gulfstream makes private jets too - that tells fighter pilots where their enemies are.
“It's an air surveillance aircraft so we get to detect aircraft at a much further range, which allows our own fighter aircraft to have good situational awareness prior to effecting the response against those aircraft,” said Captain (CPT) Kalai Selvan, one of six air warfare officers - in addition to two pilots - on board the G550.

A first look at how RSAF’s upcoming F-35 fighter jets will be refuelled mid-air



















‘Rigorous evaluation’ on F-35 continues as Singapore’s defence needs evolve: RSAF













The aircraft can detect threats at a range of more than 200 nautical miles (370km), and CPT Selvan’s job is to handle a multitude of systems, including an active electronically scanned array radar, to find, identify and track these aerial targets.
“You can see a lot of things at 200 nautical miles,” the 30-year-old told reporters on Thursday (Sep 1) at Darwin Air Base, where the G550 is participating in Exercise Pitch Black 2022. The aircraft is rarely featured in the media for reasons of operational security.

During the exercise, the G550 flies with fighter jets from different participating countries and gives them an extra edge when they take part in simulated battles against each other.
And because 17 nations are involved, the G550 has to work with more types and numbers of aircraft, compared to training missions that are carried out in Singapore. In particular, CPT Selvan highlighted his interactions with the F-35s, which are making their debut at the exercise.
“They make use of our onboard sensors to be able to respond to the adversaries that they come across during the exercise construct in the scenarios, so we offer them the eyes in the sky and early detection of adversaries,” he said.











TRAINING JUNIOR OFFICERS
CPT Selvan said the sheer number of aircraft involved means the skills of all the air warfare officers onboard are tested to the limit. “We exercise our full competency,” he said. “It’s a very exciting experience.”
There are six such officers to ensure that nothing slips under the radar.
“While airborne surveillance might sound like a one-person job, we have to manage the airborne systems and sensors on board. So, we do need the full suite of operators,” he said. “You don’t want to miss out anything ... you don’t want a single point of failure.”
CPT Selvan also trains newer air warfare officers during flights. He focuses on one officer to give them fuller attention, with the aim of getting them as competent and efficient as possible.
“Obviously when you first start learning about surveillance, your capacity is limited in terms of utilising the sensors and resources on board to detect the aircraft,” he said.
“As you get more competent, you are able to do that role much quicker and more efficiently. If you want to mount the earlier response, you want them to be competent enough to detect those guys earlier to allow our fighter jets to respond to those guys quicker.”

DEFENSIVE MEASURES
This capability that makes the G550 such a valuable asset during an offensive push also helps the plane defend itself.
“Our radar is obviously our biggest defensive mechanism because we're able to see further,” CPT Selvan said. “If we don't use it for our own advantage, then what's the point?”
In other words, the G550 avoids enemies even before they can get close enough to do damage. If they do encounter hostile planes, the G550 can use what CPT Selvan called a “self-protection suite” to dispense chaff and flares.
Chaff refers to millions of tiny aluminium or zinc coated fibres ejected by the aircraft to confuse radar-tracking missiles, while flares - commonly seen during aerial displays for aesthetic effect - are released to divert infrared-guided missiles.

The G550 also has a radar warning receiver, missile warning system and weather radar - the latter to look out for bad weather along its flight path. “Nobody likes being in turbulent weather,” CPT Selvan said.
Ultimately, the G550 takes note of what is out there from afar, and pre-empts danger for allies and itself.
“Basically, I could see all of you guys yesterday,” CPT Selvan said, referring to how the G550 was airborne on Wednesday and knew where the RSAF’s multi-role tanker transport was refuelling fighter jets.
“We really do live up to our name.”"

Arguably the best-known themed planes are operated by Taiwan’s EVA Air.
Introduced in 2005, and known for featuring everyone’s favourite queue-inducing cartoon character Hello Kitty, the planes connect Taipei with destinations like Bali, Chicago, Hong Kong and, of course, Singapore.
Unfortunately, flights with themed meals, amenities and merchandise were halted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The planes are still flying regular routes, however, and one was even used to transport essential goods in May 2020.

Not to be outdone, Disney also has a partnership with another Brazilian airline – Azul Linhas Aereas.
The arrangement sees Azul fly four planes with liveries themed after four of Disney’s original characters.
A Mickey Mouse-themed Airbus A320neo and an A321neo featuring Minnie Mouse arrived last year, while Donald Duck and Daisy Duck A320neos joined the fleet this year.

The character themes extend into the cabins, and just last month, Azul handed out souvenirs on board a flight to mark Donald’s 88th birthday.
Recent flight history shows that the planes fly domestic routes in Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the capital Brasilia among the most common destinations.

This isn’t the first Alaska plane to celebrate a Disney attraction – since 2019, the airline’s fleet has also included a plane called Friendship and Beyond at Disneyland Resort.
That one puts the Pixar Pier themed area in the spotlight with livery featuring characters from the Toy Story franchise.
Skymark Airlines

Because one Pokemon-themed plane is clearly not enough, there are actually two others operated by Japan’s Skymark Airlines and another one set to start flying for China Airlines of Taiwan.
All three planes are part of Pokemon Air Adventures, but they have (or will have) different liveries featuring different characters.
















Skymark’s Pikachu Jet BC1 and BC2 are Boeing 737-800s that primarily fly on domestic routes to destinations in Okinawa. BC1 began flying in the middle of last year while BC2 made its debut in May.
China Airlines’ upcoming Pikachu Jet CI will mainly fly between Taiwan and destinations in Asia, including Japan.

Damage caused by Clementi BTO landslide 'quite extensive' but unlikely to delay key collection: MP,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/clementi-bto-construction-site-landslide-sim-ann-damage-fairly-extensive-hdb-key-collection-delay-2917581,"SINGAPORE: The damage caused by a landslide on Friday (Sep 2) near a Clementi Build-to-Order (BTO) project is “fairly extensive” but unlikely to delay the collection of keys for buyers of the new flats, said the area's Member of Parliament Sim Ann.
The landslide occurred at about 2am on Friday near the construction site of Clementi NorthArc. 
Ms Sim (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah), who is also Senior Minister of State for National Development, told reporters that afternoon that the Housing and Development Board (HDB) had done a preliminary assessment of the situation.
""At the moment, HDB sees no reason to delay key collection beyond the dates that they have already communicated to the buyers,” she said. “But of course, we will be monitoring the situation very carefully.""
The completion date for Clementi NorthArc was originally supposed to be sometime in the third quarter of this year, but in April buyers were informed that this would be pushed back. 
Ms Sim said that based on the latest update, buyers would be able to collect their keys in December at the earliest.
Meanwhile, HDB is coordinating with the Public Utilities Board and the National Parks Board (NParks) to deal with the aftermath of the landslide.

“The damage has been quite extensive and quite a lot of effort will have to be expended on making sure that the repair methods are very properly considered and carried out, so this will also take some time,” said Ms Sim.
The immediate priority, she said, is to restore water flow into the nearby Ulu Pandan canal, with a section currently blocked with debris from the landslide.
To facilitate this, a “fairly long” part of the park connector along the canal, stretching from Ghim Moh to the Ayer Rajah Expressway, will be closed off to the public, said Ms Sim.
“We know that many residents use this stretch of park connectors regularly for recreation as well as moving from point to point. It will cause some inconvenience, but we do seek the public's understanding.""

She added that instrumentation checks on surrounding blocks as well as the new BTO project itself show that the buildings are “alright”. 
Except for the immediate area affected by soil displacement, the supply of utilities is not expected to be affected in surrounding parts, said Ms Sim.
She added that investigations on the cause of the landslide are ongoing, but that all necessary checks had been conducted prior to the start of construction work for the BTO."
"Maid jailed for stealing, returns most of the money using salary employer kept",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-jailed-stealing-returns-most-money-using-salary-employer-kept-2917491,"SINGAPORE: A 25-year-old maid was sentenced to a month's jail on Friday (Sep 2) for stealing about S$4,600 from her employer's family.
She sent most of it home to Indonesia and used a portion to buy clothes, cosmetics and mobile phones.
Bela Kharisma Lut Fitriana made restitution of about S$3,500 using her salary that was kept by her employer. The court heard that she had no other finances to make up for the remainder.
Bela pleaded guilty to one charge of theft, with another charge taken into consideration.
The court heard that Bela began working for her employers in April 2020. She cooked for the family and did household chores, and was given access to the bedrooms of the first victim, a 42-year-old woman, as well as her 74-year-old father.
She found that the victim had a safe in a cupboard in her room, and saw the password written in a book. She also noticed that the victim's father would often leave his wallet in an unlocked drawer.
Between April and December 2021, Bela took at least S$1,468 from the safe and S$3,150 from the wallet.
She roped in a friend of hers, who was also a domestic helper, to remit a total of S$3,390 to her family in Indonesia over multiple occasions.
She also used the money to buy clothes, cosmetics, a watch and two mobile phones.
Meanwhile, the victims began noticing the missing cash. On Dec 30, 2021, the first victim questioned Bela about the missing money from the safe and wallet, and Bela admitted to stealing.
A police report was lodged and police seized 25 items that Bela had bought using the stolen money. These include jeans, jackets, shirts, liquid lipsticks, body lotion and night cream.
The prosecutor asked for one to two months' jail, saying Bela had committed the offences over a significant period of time. However, he also considered that restitution had been made.
Bela, who was unrepresented, asked for leniency through an interpreter. She said she would like to go home to Indonesia. 
When the judge asked if she could make the rest of the restitution, Bela said she had no other resources and not enough money.
Her jail term was backdated to her date of arrest in August this year.
For theft in dwelling, she could have been jailed up to seven years and fined."
Secondary school discipline master admits taking more than 100 upskirt videos of teachers and students,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/secondary-school-discipline-master-took-upskirt-videos-students-teachers-2917416,"SINGAPORE: For more than three years, the discipline master of a secondary school took more than 100 upskirt videos of his female colleagues and students.
He took 12 upskirt videos of at least seven female students using modus operandi such as inviting them into the discipline room.
On one occasion, he confiscated the phone of a student who had filmed upskirt videos of a teacher and used his own phone to record the videos for himself.
The 49-year-old man, who is married with three children, pleaded guilty on Friday (Sep 2) to three charges of insulting a woman's modesty. Another five charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing.
A gag order was imposed by the court barring the publication of his name, the victims' names and the school name.
The court heard that the man had worked at the school since 2008 and was the discipline master since 2015. He also taught Mandarin.
In response to queries from CNA, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the man had been suspended from duty since July 2018 and is no longer teaching in any school.
MOE added that it takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to its standards of conduct and discipline, which could include dismissal from service.
Between April 2015 and July 2018, he filmed 156 upskirt videos of at least 38 female colleagues, mostly teachers. 
He would invite them to his work station for data entry purposes and would place his handphone under the victim's skirt while the victim was keying in data at his desk.
He invited female colleagues wearing skirts or dresses but not those wearing pants, and seldom invited male teachers to his work station for data entry.
The man also filmed 12 upskirt videos of at least seven female students between May 2015 and February 2018. He would take the student into the discipline room and film her while she was using the computer. 
The court heard that the man would transfer the videos to an external hard disk via his office laptop. He did not share or publish the clips but ""used them for his own sexual pleasure"", the prosecutor said.
On one occasion, a male student was caught and punished by the school for filming two upskirt videos of a female teacher. On the pretext of retrieving evidence, the accused confiscated the student's phone and used his own phone to film the videos before transferring them to his collection.
His actions went on until July 2018, when a female teacher at the school lodged a police report, saying she suspected the accused had been taking upskirt videos of teachers including herself.
Police seized his hard disk and found 173 upskirt videos in the accused's possession. He titled each clip with the victim's names or initials or with descriptions.
Investigations also revealed that he had filmed an upskirt video of a female relative at a party his mother-in-law was hosting.
ACCUSED ABUSED POSITION: PROSECUTOR
The prosecutor asked for between 12 and 18 months' jail, saying that the accused abused the trust of his female colleagues and his position as discipline master. The victims who were students were especially vulnerable, and the accused exploited their deference to his authority as well as the trust their parents placed in the school and its faculty, she said.
However, she accepted that the accused was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time, after losing his mother in 2015. His wife also underwent surgery for medical ailments in 2016, after which their frequency of sexual intimacy ""drastically diminished"".
""However, while these factors invite some sympathy, they do not excuse the accused's conduct,"" said the prosecutor.
Defence lawyer Laurence Goh asked the court to order a mandatory treatment order suitability report. He said his client was suffering from ""double depression"" at the time of the offences.
A doctor with the Institute of Mental Health had said his disorder contributed to his offences, said Mr Goh.
The prosecutor objected to the defence's ""conclusion"" that the accused would not be able to undergo psychiatric treatment if he is sentenced to jail, calling this ""leaping to conclusions"".
The prison is ""fully able to continue monitoring and treating his conditions"", and the psychiatric unit of the Changi Medical Complex is administered by IMH, she said.
The judge noted the accused's mental conditions at the time and that there is a contributory link to his offending behaviour. She granted the defence's request to call for a mandatory treatment order suitability report, but stressed that even if he is found suitable, the court may not necessarily impose such an order.
He will return to court for sentencing in November."
2 electric motorcycle battery swap and charge stations launched in Singapore,"Announcing the trial sandboxes at Land Transport Industry Day, Transport Minister S Iswaran also said that the renewed compact for the sector, which is being looked at as part of the Forward Singapore process, must be guided by key imperatives of choice, cost and climate.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-motorcycle-battery-swap-charge-stations-gogoro-mo-batteries-ev-iswaran-lta-2917286,"SINGAPORE: Two battery ""swap and charge"" stations for electric motorcycles were launched on Friday (Sep 2) by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), in a bid to encourage greater adoption of cleaner-energy vehicle use in Singapore.
The two trial sandboxes are run by Taiwanese company Gogoro and Singapore-headquartered MO Batteries respectively, and will allow depleted electric motorcycle batteries to be swapped with fully charged ones within seconds. 
Both sandboxes will be primarily used for deliveries.
Gogoro will partner investment holding firm Jardine Cycle & Carriage to conduct trials using their electric motorcycles and battery swap stations for last mile deliveries.
MO Batteries will partner SingPost and security solutions provider Prosegur to conduct pilots using their electric motorcycles, as well as a combination of centralised charging and battery swap and storage, said LTA in a news release. 
The regulatory sandbox with Gogoro will involve 20 electric motorcycles and 100 swappable batteries at two Gogoro GoStations, while MO Batteries will have six electric motorcycles with 30 swappable batteries, 14 chargers and two battery store and swap stations, added an LTA spokesperson.
These trials will begin in the next few weeks and run for 12 months.
""The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is another key thrust for greening the land transport sector,"" said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Friday.
""We have set out our vision to achieve 100 per cent cleaner-energy vehicles by 2040. This is a tall order because it entails a major transition away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles towards EVs and other cleaner-energy vehicles.""
In a speech at the Land Transport Industry Day event, he added: ""With the growing range of charging solutions, we hope to encourage the adoption of more electric motorcycle models in Singapore.""

PREPARING WORKFORCE FOR EV TRANSITION 
In tandem with Singapore's push toward a greener future is the need to prepare the workforce's transition to EV use.
To that end, LTA has launched a National Electric Vehicle Specialist Safety certification in partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore.  
“This is the first step in equipping workshop technicians with the skills to work safely in an EV environment,” said Mr Iswaran. 
Technicians can sign up for subsidised courses and obtain the certification under the Workforce Skills Qualification framework developed by SkillsFuture Singapore.
Three of these courses - at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education - are now open for enrolment. 
Certificate holders will be equipped with skills and knowledge to safely conduct electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle servicing in a high-voltage environment, added LTA. 
These industry-recognised certifications will “pave the way for automotive technicians to subsequently receive further specialised training in electric vehicles”. 
LTA is also partnering with Workforce Singapore (WSG) to offer salary support for workshop technicians who are training under the WSG Career Conversion Programme for Sustainability Professionals (EV Specialists). 
“This transition will bring opportunities and jobs for our workers, who will also need to be equipped with new skill sets. And while the journey will take many years, we need to start investing in skills upgrading now,” said Mr Iswaran.

FORWARD SINGAPORE UPDATE
Mr Iswaran on Friday also gave a first update on an area under his purview in the Forward Singapore exercise, which was launched by the fourth-generation or 4G leadership team in June to review and refresh Singapore's social compact.
The year-long initiative will be organised across six pillars.
The Build pillar – which entails the home and living environment – is helmed by Mr Iswaran, Communications and Information Minister Josephine Teo, and Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee. 
“The future of our land transport system is an integral part of this exercise under the Build pillar of Forward Singapore. Our goal is to forge a renewed compact for land transport guided by the key imperatives of choice, cost and climate,” said Mr Iswaran on Friday. 
A public consultation exercise on the proposed legislation to regulate EV charging in Singapore was organised from Jun 15 to Jul 14 by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and LTA.
Over 70 responses were received from a range of stakeholders, with the feedback generally supportive of the proposed legislative measures, said MOT and LTA in a joint news release on Friday. 
Responding to queries on what such engagements under Forward Singapore would entail, Mr Iswaran highlighted the need to revisit ""existing assumptions"" about ""various demographics"", to see whether they still hold or whether a ""new formulation"" needs to be considered.
""Of course, the fact is there are changing aspirations and needs in our society, not just because of demographic considerations, but also because of ... habits and culture changes,"" he told reporters.  
""For example, we've seen that with the pandemic, there has been a greater tendency to work from home, but also for people to take up more active mobility modalities. So these also have to be taken into account.""
Said Mr Iswaran: ""Is this changing things in a fundamental way for the long term? Or is it more a transient phenomenon? And if it is a fundamental shift, then how do we accommodate it within the context of our larger land transport blueprint?""
The idea for engagement sessions is really to adopt a ""listening mode"" in the first instance, he added.
""Because whilst we have longer-term plans and ideas, many of which people are already familiar with, we need to use this opportunity to hear directly from the different groups ... in our society, and understand this before we then respond with a formulation which will be an integral part of the larger social compact."" 
Earlier, in his speech, Mr Iswaran also explained the guiding imperatives of choice, cost and climate.
He noted that the evolution of Singapore's land transport system has been marked by choices at every level.
To be “meaningful and sustainable”, these choices must be predicated on a ""careful evaluation"" of costs – not just financial or fiscal ones, but also opportunities that may be foregone as a result of those choices, Mr Iswaran said. 
“Today, this choice-cost matrix must be augmented by a third dimension, which is climate. With the existential climate change, we must address the environmental impact of the choices we face for our transport system”, the minister added. 
""To build a land transport system that meets the evolving needs of our society, we must decide on the choices we want to make, understand the costs and trade-offs they entail, agree on how these costs are to be borne, while stewarding and safeguarding our shared environmental and fiscal resources.""
He said: “We need conversations about our respective roles and responsibilities in this endeavour – whether as a commuter or taxpayer, as a motorist or a cyclist, as an industry player or government regulator.""
“In other words, we need to come together to forge a renewed social compact on urban mobility, to build a transport system that meets the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans today, as well as those of our future generations.”"
Passer-by injured after landslide at BTO construction site in Clementi,"Water can still flow in Sungei Ulu Pandan, and PUB's quick response teams are on standby to respond to any potential flooding if it rains heavily, said the agency.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-injured-landslide-bto-northarc-construction-site-clementi-avenue-6-2917266,"SINGAPORE: A man sustained minor injuries after a landslide occurred at a construction site for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in Clementi on Friday (Sep 2) morning. 
In a Facebook post, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) said the incident at the Clementi NorthArc BTO site resulted in ""soil displacement"" into Sungei Ulu Pandan, causing damage to the Ulu Pandan park connector. 
""A male passer-by, who suffered some minor injuries and was attended to at site, is now resting at home. Agencies are in touch with him to render any further assistance that may be necessary,"" said HDB. 
No other injuries were reported. 
The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has issued a stop-work order for the affected location. Works for the buildings that are not affected can proceed, it said.
BCA and HDB engineers, together with a professional engineer, have assessed the buildings in the immediate area and confirmed they remain structurally sound, said BCA in an update on Friday afternoon.
The builder and professional engineer have to carry out ""slope stabilisation measures"" and monitor the soil movement, BCA added.
HDB added it is working with the national water agency PUB, the National Parks Board (NParks), and the BCA to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident, and to carry out the necessary recovery action.

In an update on Friday evening, HDB said that the ""slope failure"" had occurred at the edge of the construction site, where a retaining wall was being constructed to prepare for the subsequent building of a future basketball court and pavilion in the area.
Immediate measures to mitigate the impact of the ""slope failure"" are being carried out, including applying a thin layer of concrete to stabilise the slope within the site - this will be completed by Friday night - as well as creating a channel to improve water flow through the canal.
As part of the recovery measures, HDB said it will be working to remove the dislodged soil in the canal, reinstate the damaged part of the park connector, as well as reconstruct the slope and retaining walls within the site. Works are expected to start next week.
For safety reasons, the area around the site, including the park connector next to it, has been temporarily cordoned off and will not be accessible by the public.
""We will keep flat buyers updated should there be any changes to the completion date of their flats,"" said HDB.
In a Facebook post on Friday afternoon, PUB said a section of Ulu Pandan canal was affected by the landslide.
""There have been some concerns over potential flooding and if the canal is choked,"" the agency said.
""At present, water can still flow in Sungei Ulu Pandan and HDB is working on the earth removal within the canal. Water quality in the nearest reservoir, Pandan Reservoir, is not affected by this incident.""
PUB is monitoring the incident and has deployed its quick response team vehicles at locations upstream of the canal. They are on standby to respond to any potential flooding if it rains heavily, said the agency

Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann told reporters that the damage has been quite extensive and that the immediate priority is to restore water flow in Ulu Pandan canal.
A ""fairly long stretch"" of the park connectors on both banks of the canal, from Ghim Moh to the Ayer Rajah Expressway, will be closed, she said.
""We know that many residents use this stretch of park connectors regularly for recreation as well as moving point to point. It will cause some inconvenience, but we do seek the public's understanding,"" said Ms Sim, who is also a Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.
She also addressed concerns from some buyers of the BTO flats on whether the collection of keys will be delayed. She said that HDB has done a preliminary assessment and sees no reason to delay the collection of keys.

Damage caused by Clementi BTO landslide 'quite extensive' but unlikely to delay key collection: MP
























When CNA arrived at about 11.15am on Friday, two excavators were moving soil from the slope.
Several migrant workers told CNA that they arrived at 8am but were told they could not start work. According to them, the landslide occurred in the early hours of the morning.
Residents who spoke to CNA said they were unaware of the incident and they did not hear any loud sounds during the night. Some expressed concerns about their safety.
“We’re worried because we stay on such a high floor so if anything happens again, it could affect us,” said Ms Florence Yeo, who stays on the 32nd floor of a block across the affected site.
Ms Amy Ng, who moved into her flat at Blk 208B Clementi Avenue 6 about five years ago, said she was concerned when she first saw construction work in the area.
“I saw that they were doing work on a slope and that raised some alarms in my mind. But I trusted that the authorities knew what they were doing, so I wasn’t worried about it,"" she said in Mandarin.
""Now I’m worried (if) it happens again and it affects my house. Who is going to pay if there are any damages?”
An entrance to the park connector next to the affected site was cordoned off. The pavement appeared to be disjointed with cracks in several parts.

Risks of legal challenge to definition of marriage illustrated by Indian Supreme Court decision: Shanmugam,"India's highest court ruled last month that familial relationships may take the form of domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/indian-supreme-court-ruling-definition-families-k-shanmugam-2916046,"SINGAPORE: The risks of a legal challenge to the current definition of marriage in Singapore have been ""starkly illustrated"" by an Indian Supreme Court decision to recognise different types of ""families"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said on Thursday (Sep 1).
Mr Shanmugam said that the courts in Singapore have avoided making such rulings, leaving them instead to Parliament.
""Our courts have traditionally eschewed such an approach, and have said that these matters should be dealt with in Parliament,"" Mr Shanmugam said in a Facebook post, adding that planned Constitutional amendments will seek to ensure that.
India's highest court ruled last month that familial relationships may take the form of domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships, and that such ""atypical manifestations"" of the family unit are equally deserving of social welfare benefits.
The ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions to challenge India's social norms and could have major implications for the rights of women as well as gay people.
Mr Shanmugam noted that the Indian Supreme Court decision came just a few years after it struck out part of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which is similar to Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code that criminalises sex between men.
He reiterated that the Singapore Government will amend the Constitution to prevent the current definition of marriage from being challenged in the courts, after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced in his National Day Rally speech last week that Section 377A will be repealed.
""Currently, 'marriage' is defined (in law) as one between a man and a woman. This definition is likely, in due course, to be challenged in the courts, as being in breach of the Constitution (together with future court challenges on s377A)
""To prevent such legal challenges, the Government said last week that we will amend the Constitution – to make sure that what a ‘marriage’ should be, is decided in Parliament, and not through a challenge in the courts.""

Repeal of Section 377A does not meet ‘very high’ bar to hold referendum, says DPM Wong



















‘Not possible’ to keep status quo on Section 377A given vulnerability to legal challenges: Edwin Tong













""EQUALLY DESERVING""
The Indian Supreme Court ruling stems from the case of Deepika Singh, a nurse whose employer had denied her application for maternity leave after she gave birth because she had already taken leave to care for her husband’s children from a previous marriage.
The court ruled in her favour, noting that the predominant understanding of the concept of a ""family"" both in the law and in society is that it consists of a single, unchanging unit with a mother and a father - who remain constant over time - and their children.
""This assumption ignores both the many circumstances which may lead to a change in one’s familial structure, and the fact that many families do not conform to this expectation to begin with,"" said judges Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna.
""Familial relationships may take the form of domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships. A household may be a single-parent household for any number of reasons, including the death of a spouse, separation or divorce,"" they stated in a court document.
""Similarly, the guardians and caretakers ... of children may change with remarriage, adoption or fostering. These manifestations of love and of families may not be typical but they are as real as their traditional counterparts.
""Such atypical manifestations of the family unit are equally deserving not only of protection under law, but also of the benefits available under social welfare legislation.""

"Legalisation of cannabis in Thailand will present more challenges, with many people travelling to and from Singapore: Shanmugam","Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam also said the death penalty works as a serious deterrent against drug trafficking.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/thailand-travel-weed-legal-cannabis-cnb-singapore-shanmugam-2915951,"SINGAPORE: The freer availability of cannabis in Thailand will present more challenges, with many people travelling to and from Singapore, said Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam on Thursday (Sep 1).
Mr Shanmugam was responding to a question by Malaysian broadcaster Astro Awani about how Thailand’s decision to legalise cannabis will impact the drug situation in the region and in Singapore.
“Would it be a problem? I think the freer availability of cannabis in Thailand, to which a lot of Singaporeans go to and from, where a lot of tourists come to Singapore, is going to present more challenges. I'm sure it will,” he said on Astro Awani’s Consider This programme.
If there is clear evidence of current use of drugs, Singapore authorities will take action, regardless of whether the consumption was in Singapore or overseas, the minister said in a Facebook post earlier on Thursday about national swimmers Joseph Schooling and Amanda Lim.
Schooling and Lim had both admitted to taking drugs in the past, he added in the post.

'No clear evidence' Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim were taking drugs; no preferential treatment given: Shanmugam













Research shows that the use of cannabis is harmful and addictive, said Mr Shanmugam, noting that it can cause irreversible brain damage, brain shrinkage, serious mental and psychiatric illnesses.
“Some pharma companies and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) with vested interests have argued that cannabis is a soft drug, that cannabinoids have medical benefits,” he added.
“But really, they are driven by the green rush, the desire to make money. It is a lucrative industry.”
In Singapore, the use of cannabis is allowed when doctors require it for medical purposes, based on medical advice, said Mr Shanmugam, who is also Law Minister.
After Thailand decriminalised the sale of cannabis in June, the government “had to then try to rein in the effects”, he added.
“Within a week, cannabis was everywhere in drinks, in food, in toothpaste and cookies,” he added.
The Thai government made schools cannabis-free areas, banned smoking in public, and banned the sale of cannabis to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. It also moved to try and protect minors and vulnerable parts of the population, Mr Shanmugam said.
“But once it's in cookies, and once it’s in soft drinks, and once it’s in toothpaste, how do you protect breastfeeding mothers? How do you protect pregnant women? How do you protect young children? How do you police this? So, there are difficulties in controlling once you do this,” he added.

Thailand legalises growing, consumption of marijuana













MALAYSIA’S CANNABIS LAWS
Mr Shanmugam also responded to a question about Malaysia’s health ministry researching and looking into legalising medical marijuana, and how it could impact Singapore.
“If Malaysia legalises cannabis or other drugs, given the even greater flow of people between Malaysia and Singapore compared to Thailand and Singapore, of course, it will be more challenging from the law enforcement (angle) and trying to keep Singapore drug free,” said the minister.
“If you mean by impact, whether because Malaysia does something therefore will we follow suit, I think that's not the usual way our legislation works,” he added.
“We look at the research and we look at the science, and we decide for ourselves. And our laws don't always look like Malaysian laws, and our policies don't look like Malaysian policies. We diverge when we have to.”
With Malaysia planning to abolish mandatory death penalty, Mr Shanmugam was asked if this was something Singapore would consider.
“There is a good reason why we have the mandatory death penalty,” said the minister.
“These are matters for Government and as a matter of policy, for a long time, we have decided that once a certain threshold is crossed, in order to have the deterrent effect, people must know that the mandatory death penalty will apply.
“If we remove that, the deterrent effect of the death penalty will be substantially reduced.”
He noted that the mandatory death penalty has a “very high deterrent effect”.
“And if you remove that, you dilute the deterrent effect, and the deterrent effect is part of the Government's policy against drugs,” he said.
“So, we are not likely to change simply because Malaysia changes. We will change when we think that the deterrent effect is no longer there, for example, or the conditions are different, and you need to adopt a different approach to have that deterrence.
“It is a question of what's your policy, and how you seek to achieve it.”
He said the task of any government is to persuade people that they are doing the right thing.  If there is a different view that is in the majority, laws will have to change to reflect the majority viewpoint, he said.
“But, if you are in the government and you believe that something is right, whether it's majority viewpoint or minority viewpoint, you explain your position, and then you decide whether morally, you are prepared to stay on even though you think the steps that are going to be taken are going to be against public interest.”

PENALTIES MUST BE EFFECTIVE, DETERRENT
The minister was asked about the Singapore Government’s approach to those working against the death penalty.
He said any penalty can only be justified if it is explained rationally.
“You don’t impose a penalty, particularly the death penalty, because you want to be harsh. This is not the question of being harsh for the sake of being harsh,” he added.
“The penalty must be effective, it must be deterrent, and that's what I mean by effective.”
People know of the laws in Singapore and therefore they do not traffic drugs, he said.
“Some decide that they will chance their lives, take the risk, because they want to make a few extra bucks. But most don't,” he added.
He said that it is his duty to continue to try and persuade Singaporeans that having the death penalty works as a serious deterrent, and that it saves thousands of lives.
According to a 2021 survey by the Government, seven in 10 people say they support the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking, and nearly 80 per cent support the mandatory death penalty for murder, noted Mr Shanmugam.
“Why do they support it? Because more than 80 per cent believe that the death penalty had deterred these offences in Singapore. Twenty to 30 per cent disagree, and in any democratic country, you will have that 20 to 30 per cent that disagree. The data speaks for itself,” he added.
A government survey of the region where people could be trafficking drugs into Singapore also indicates that a “substantial majority” – more than 60 per cent of people, including people in southern Malaysia – said that the death penalty is a very effective deterrent, said Mr Shanmugam.
“How does Singapore’s reputation suffer? I mean, there are people who are ideologically opposed. But you must be careful to distinguish between a few Western correspondents, who go to the same people in Singapore who oppose the death penalty, quote them, and then write articles,” he added.
“And the majority viewpoint in Singapore, and the majority viewpoint about Singapore, is a well-governed, well-run, well-managed country, where people are free to walk about and do what they want to do.”
Mr Shanmugam also addressed criticism that the survey was not an independent one.
“When you don't like the results, some people will question the results too,” he said.
“Let's be clear. Drugs are bad, drugs destroy more lives. It's a point I make. These large numbers, there is no answer. We are responsible for the lives of Singaporeans,” he added.
“And this survey - I don't design the surveys, I don't look at the questions. They are done by professionals, and we are not in the business of designing questions in a way where we get the answers we want. I'm sure it was done professionally.""

Several cyclists CNA spoke to on Thursday welcomed the move and said that the area is a popular spot for those who cycle. 
Co-founder of recreational cycling group Love Cycling SG Woon Taiwoon said the new dedicated lane will serve to help new riders as the environment along West Camp Road is ""actually quite safe"". 
""I think Singapore is at this inflection point where cycling is getting popular,"" said Mr Woon, adding that more people started recreational riding during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The 48-year-old product design manager added that the pilot will probably raise more awareness about the area, and that it is a ""good spot to come and ride"". 
However, Mr Woon wanted to know how the dedicated cycling lane will be enforced. He added that it could potentially make things very complicated because ""there is a very limited window - 5am to 11am"".
""So I think there may potentially be some issues that will invariably happen,"" he said, adding there may be tensions between cyclists and drivers.

""LITTLE TRAFFIC"" IN THE AREA
Adrian Yeo, leader of recreational cycling group BPR Cycling Club, said one reason West Camp Road is a good place to cycle is that there is ""little traffic"", as it only serves the aerospace companies in the area. 
""(It has) a very nice U-shape, I call it the horseshoe. It's a 9km loop that cyclists can do,"" said Mr Yeo, who cycles at Seletar Aerospace and Tanah Merah Coast Road with his group. 
The area also has a lot of buildings, so cyclists don't get a lot of crosswinds, which allow them to maintain a consistent speed, said Mr Yeo, who is a regional marketing director. 
""I think at the moment, (traffic) is pretty good. The only thing you have are buses, but the buses are not that frequent. So far, you only have cyclists over there, that's all I can see."" 
Another cyclist, Clarence Lee, said the road is ""good training ground"" where there are certain spots that allow cyclists to sprint ""really really fast"" and other spots which allow them to recover. 
""You can't really get that in regular roads along Singapore,"" said the 45-year-old business owner.

However, while it is good that cyclists have a safe road to cycle on, another cyclist, Anthony Yeo, said that it may be dangerous if the lane is packed with cyclists. 
Mr Yeo, 40, said many cyclists frequent West Camp Road at night to ""ride a few loops"" or do their training.
Mr Lee added that many people also cycle at Seletar on weekday nights, not just on Sundays, and the area is basically like a ""cyclist's haven"" after 8.30pm. 
""I think it would be great if we could extend the trial to include weekday nights as well because the place is deserted anyway. What about Saturdays, and actually the whole of Sunday?
""There aren't any cars there, so why is it only like 5am to 11?""
Mr Lee also said that some cyclists feel the dedicated cycling lane is ""just like another bus lane"", as buses are still allowed to use the lane. 
""SAFER RIDING ENVIRONMENT""
President of the Singapore Cycling Federation Hing Siong Chen said the dedicated bike lane will provide ""a safer riding environment for both beginners and experienced riders and can also cater to families who cycle together"". 
""We are seeing more and more recreational and sport cyclist in the past two years since COVID-19 started,"" said Dr Hing, who is a family physician with Healthway Medical. 
The trial for the new cycling lane was earlier announced in Parliament in March by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng. 
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr Baey said the on-road cycling lane along West Camp Road will allow cyclists to cycle in larger groups, and ""allowing them more safety and security while cycling"". 
""Hopefully, this would help newer on-road cyclists gain confidence and allow room for practising to cycle to the far left of the road when cycling elsewhere,"" said Mr Baey.

Wet weather expected to continue into first half of September: Met Service,"There will also be a few warm and humid nights. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wet-weather-rain-continue-september-2022-met-service-2915491,"SINGAPORE: Wet weather is expected to continue into the first half of September, said the Meteorological Service Singapore on Thursday (Sep 1).
In its fortnightly outlook, the Met Service said that the first two weeks of September will be ""wet with a few warm days"". 
Thundery showers are forecast between the morning and early afternoon over parts of Singapore on most days, as the monsoon rain band is expected to lie over the equatorial Southeast Asia region.
""The development of low-pressure systems over the northern South China Sea could trigger Sumatra squalls over the Strait of Malacca and bring widespread thundery showers and gusty winds to Singapore between the early and pre-dawn hours on some days,"" said the Met Service.
Widespread moderate to heavy thundery showers can be expected on one or two days, when prevailing winds in the region converge over Singapore and the surrounding region.
The total rainfall for the first half of the month is likely to be near average over most parts of the island.
On most days, the daily temperature is forecast to range between 24 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius, with some days reaching daily highs of about 34 degrees Celsius. 
On a few rainy days, the daily minimum temperature may dip to below 22 degrees Celsius.
Warm and humid conditions as well as minimum temperatures of up to 28 degrees Celsius can be expected on a few nights, particularly in the south-eastern areas of the country.

REVIEW OF AUGUST WEATHER
South-west monsoon conditions prevailed over the region in August, with low-level winds blowing from the south-east or south-west on most days, and from the east on a few days, the Met Service said.
The second half of August saw more showers than the first half, which can be largely attributed to the passage of the wet phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation.
The phenomenon is characterised as an eastward propagation of clouds and rainfall over the tropical regions from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, with a period of between 30 and 60 days on average. 
On most days in August, moderate to heavy thundery showers affected the island in the late morning and afternoon, extending into the evening on a few days. 
Passing Sumatra squalls brought widespread thundery showers with gusty winds to Singapore in the morning on several days.
On Aug 23, large-scale convergence of winds in the surrounding area brought moderate to heavy thundery showers and gusty winds over Singapore in the morning. The highest daily total rainfall recorded that day was 118.2mm at Jurong, the highest daily total rainfall for the month.
The daily maximum temperature was kept below 34 degrees Celsius on most days due to the rainy weather, which brought several days with cool nighttime temperatures. 
There were 20 days with daily minimum temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius or less. The lowest daily minimum temperature was 21.7 degrees Celsius, recorded at Jurong on Aug 16.
There were still some warm days in August, mainly in its first half. The highest daily maximum temperature of 35.1 degrees Celsius was recorded at Marina Barrage on Aug 11 and Aug 17.
""On a few nights during the month, the daily minimum temperature over the southern, eastern and western coastal areas of the island were above 28 degrees Celsius,"" the Met Service said.
About two-thirds of the country experienced above average rainfall in August, with most of the rain falling over the northern and western parts of Singapore.
The rainfall recorded at Jurong was 115 per cent above average while the recording at Chai Chee was 21 per cent below average."

Najib’s wife Rosmah sentenced to 10 years in jail, fined RM970 million for solar project corruption case
Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, was found guilty of corruption on Thursday (Sep 1). She was sentenced to 10 years in jail and a fine of RM970 million (US$216 million). 
Rosmah was found guilty of three charges and sentenced to 10 years in jail for each. All three prison terms will run concurrently. There will be a stay of execution pending appeal at the Court of Appeal. She will be allowed to remain on her current bail of RM2 million.
During mitigation, Rosmah told the court that she was saddened by the decision. She also begged for compassion as a “woman taking over a man’s role in the house”, referring to how Najib is now serving time in jail.
Here's a timeline of what has happened since she was charged. 
2 dead after car and bus collide at Woodlands junction
A road accident involving a car and a Tower Transit bus killed two people early on Thursday (Sep 1) morning. It was at the junction of Woodlands Avenue 9 and Woodlands Avenue 4.
The car driver, a 32-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. A 53-year-old woman, who was a passenger on the bus, subsequently died in hospital. Nine others were taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.
Police investigations are ongoing.
'No clear evidence' that Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim were currently taking drugs: Shanmugam
Explaining steps taken against the Singapore swimmers, Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam said the evidence was inconclusive and their urine tests were negative. 
Schooling and Lim however were ""honest"" and admitted to having taken drugs in the past, he said.
He added that Lim had a ""drug utensil"" and received a warning for that. 
Mr Shanmugam stressed that the Government does not send people to rehabilitation centres or give warnings if there is no positive test, or if they are not currently taking drugs. He added that CNB will take steps if there is clear evidence of current use of drugs, regardless of whether the consumption took place in Singapore or overseas.

Man jailed for punching and fracturing victim's face over taxi queue dispute,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-punching-fracturing-victim-face-taxi-queue-dispute-2915096,"SINGAPORE: A man who had waited more than 30 minutes for a taxi got into a fight with another man who was also waiting for a cab, with both thinking the other had cut the queue.
For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, 32-year-old Sim Yi Ming was jailed for 11 months on Thursday (Sep 1).
The court heard that Sim had gone to a pub at Golden Mile Complex for drinks with a friend on the night of Dec 27, 2021. The victim, a 39-year-old man, had also gone to a pub in the same building. 
Between 10pm and 11pm, the victim left the pub and went to a taxi stand to wait for a cab. Sim and his friend separately left the pub they were in and walked to the entrance of Golden Mile Complex.
They could not book a private-hire car via Grab or Gojek and wanted to flag down a taxi.
The victim thought that Sim and his friend wanted to cut the queue, so he walked in front of them to wait for a taxi.
Sim and his friend approached the victim and asked what he was doing. The victim replied that he was waiting for a taxi, and a dispute broke out.
Sim punched the victim in the eye, and both men fell to the ground, with Sim punching the victim multiple times in the face.
Police officers patrolling the area were alerted to the incident and separated the two men.
The victim sustained a fracture around his eye and tenderness over his face. He was taken to hospital and admitted for observation and management of his injuries. The man was given seven days' hospitalisation leave.
In mitigation, Sim, who was unrepresented, claimed that he had been waiting to flag a cab for more than 30 minutes.
""My Gojek and the Grab are down. The victim ... he cut my queue, and I walk to him and tell him politely (that I was) waiting,"" he said.
He said he told the victim that he did not mind if the latter was waiting for a Grab or a Gojek, but the victim said he was waiting for a taxi.
""I say I wait quite long ... already, and I (was) very tired. After that, he (didn't) want to back off, and he continued to say those words to try to get into conflict with me, that's why we have this,"" said Sim, adding that the victim shouted vulgarities at him.
He said he knew that it was his fault but hoped that the judge would be more lenient.
The prosecutor called for 10 to 11 months' jail, noting Sim's previous convictions including voluntarily causing hurt in 2014, for which he spent three weeks in jail.
""While we acknowledge that the victim walked in front of him to try to get a taxi, there was really no reason for him to resort to violence in this case,"" said the prosecutor, adding that Sim had been drinking and was intoxicated.
The judge said that ""regardless of whatever provocation"" the victim made, there was no reason for Sim to punch him and fracture his face.
For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned."
A first look at how RSAF’s upcoming F-35 fighter jets will be refuelled mid-air,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/first-look-rsaf-upcoming-f-35-fighter-gets-refuelled-mid-air-2915171,"DARWIN: “Trailing the hose,” the pilot of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) announced briskly to the cabin.
 
Looking out of the window, a pod under the wing spit out a long, thin black line that was hard to spot against the fluffy clouds and blue sky.
 
Like a tentacle, the hose quickly extended and reached out far to the rear, its basket tip gently bobbing as the MRTT cruised at hundreds of kilometres an hour.

On the right side, a United States Marine Corps F-35B appeared and floated upwards, soon followed by another. The stealth fighters avoided the hose – this was one of the few occasions they needed to be “visible” while airborne – but kept within arm’s length, waiting for another ally.
 
Several minutes passed before a third F-35B, known as the receiver in aerial refuelling parlance, emerged from beneath the MRTT.
 
The fighter jet, fuel probe to the side of the cockpit already visible, edged closer and closer to the hose, mirroring the subtle movements of the basket.

And when everything lined up, the F-35B lurched forward just a tiny bit, snapping probe and basket together. Fuel gushed through the hose and the mission was a success – another job well done by both refueller and receiver. 
“All of the refuelling done is very challenging,” air refuelling operator 2nd Sergeant (2SG) Lim Li Jun, 27, told reporters on Wednesday (Aug 31) on the MRTT after refuelling the F-35B.

The RSAF tanker is making its debut at Exercise Pitch Black in Darwin, Australia, where it is also refuelling the F-35s for the first time. On Wednesday it refuelled a dozen fighter jets, including the RSAF’s F-15SG and F-16D+ as well as Australian F-35As and US F-35Bs.
What is significant is that Singapore is also buying the F-35B, with an initial four jets to be delivered in 2026. MRTT pilot Major (MAJ) Michelle Teo, 32, welcomed the chance to refuel the jets as a “good experience”.
“It does give us an insight and an opportunity to learn about air-to-air refuelling with them, because in the future, we are also acquiring the F-35,” she said.

‘Rigorous evaluation’ on F-35 continues as Singapore’s defence needs evolve: RSAF













HOSE AND DROGUE
The method of tanking the F-35B - the short-take off and vertical landing variant - is also different from the conventional F-35A variant and RSAF’s current jets.
 
While RSAF’s fighters are refuelled using the boom method, where the air refuelling operator manoeuvres the MRTT’s boom into a receptacle on the receiving jet, the F-35B is refuelled using the hose and drogue method.
 
In this case, the air refuelling operator simply extends the hose. Then it is up to the pilot to manoeuvre the jet’s fuel probe into the basket.

While 2SG Lim acknowledged that the hose and drogue method requires less input from the air refuelling operator, she insisted it is not a question of which method is easier.
 
“It’s a different refuelling system,” she said. “I’m not moving the hose but I will give them verbal corrections like ‘forward two’, ‘back two’.”
 
2SG Lim said air refuelling operators, who have a close-up view of the receiving jets via cameras on the hose tips, are trained to handle the two hoses - one from either wing - simultaneously.

They take note of speed differences between the MRTT and receiver, and relay this information to the pilots. 
 
“It's just to ensure that we are all at the optimum speeds to do the refuelling together,” MAJ Teo said.

2SG Lim highlighted that the F-35B’s shape makes it “bulkier” and thus “much more stable” during refuelling, but the crew members again said this does not make the refuelling operation any easier.
“I think for every receiver there is a unique characteristic. So it's just like different shapes of different cars,” MAJ Teo said.
 
“And similarly, it's just for the air refuelling operator to get used to that characteristic to do the tanking.”

MISSED ATTEMPT
These complexities were clear to see on Wednesday, when another F-35B on the left side of the MRTT - also handled by 2SG Lim - could not be refuelled.
The F-35B pilot tried to connect with the basket but narrowly missed. After a few attempts, the jet left without refuelling.
MAJ Teo attributed the unsuccessful attempt to turbulent weather during the contact phase that made the hose basket move “a lot”.

“Usually we would want to wait for more stable conditions to make that contact, but that was not possible today. They were a little bit tight on time because they needed to leave the airspace earlier,” she explained.
 
“So in the ideal situation ... definitely there would have been a successful contact. But unfortunate for today, and it happens. In a real exercise scenario, if they are unable to take the gas, they will still continue the mission if possible.”

DIFFERENT FIGHTERS
While 2SG Lim admitted that some factors like turbulence were beyond her control, she is excited about refuelling fighter jets from different countries such as Australia’s EA-18G Growlers and Rafale fighter jets flown by the French air force. 
 
The large training area for Exercise Pitch Black has allowed 2SG Lim to conduct boom refuelling during longer periods of straight and level flight.

“Back in Singapore, we only have a small airspace to manoeuvre, such that a lot of air-to-air refuelling is conducted in a turn,” she said, adding that receiving jets are usually more stable when flying straight legs.
 
But perhaps the highlight for 2SG Lim is refuelling the F-35B in real life, something she had only experienced through simulators and technical documents prior to the exercise.
 
“I'm very honoured to be the first few RSAF air refuelling operators to be able to tank with the F-35B, and so closely in my monitor screen,” she said."
Man facing COVID-19 related charges remanded almost a year after arrest warrant issued,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-related-charges-remanded-almost-year-arrest-warrant-2914931,"SINGAPORE: A man who skipped court in October last year over charges of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 has been remanded and given new charges.
Verner Chua Jun Jie, 22, was handed two new charges on Thursday (Sep 1) for cutting his GPS tag at a flat in Bukit Batok in September last year and for failing to report to Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre that same month.
Chua was charged last year with two counts of exposing others to the risk of infection. He was accused of failing to stay home in August 2020 despite receiving a medical certificate ordering him to stay home for five days as he had an acute respiratory infection.
Instead, he took a Grab vehicle to visit his grandmother in West Coast and another Grab vehicle to buy lunch before heading home, charge sheets stated.
He is accused of repeating this offence in December 2020 while he was on medical leave for acute respiratory infection and had not yet received a negative COVID-19 test result.
He allegedly took taxis to have dessert with a friend in Balestier Road and for frog porridge in Geylang.
By his actions, Chua allegedly exposed his grandmother, his friend and other people at those locations to the risk of contracting COVID-19.
Chua was set to plead guilty in October last year, but an arrest warrant was issued for him that month when he failed to turn up in court. He was remanded on Thursday and is set to plead guilty on Sep 13.
If convicted under the Infectious Diseases Act, he could be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, per charge.
For mischief, he could be jailed for up to a year, fined, or both. For failing to turn up at the supervision centre, he can be jailed for up to a month, fined up to S$1,500, or both.

Companies ordered to conduct mandatory time-out to review safety procedures amid uptick in workplace fatalities and injuries,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-safety-companies-mandatory-time-out-review-safety-deaths-injuries-2914936,"SINGAPORE: Companies in higher risk sectors will be required to conduct a mandatory safety time-out to review safety procedures, announced the Ministry of Manpower on Thursday (Sep 1). 
These companies must conduct the safety time-out by Sep 15, said the ministry, adding that those who fail to do so will be debarred from employing new foreign employees for one month.
This is the first time a mandatory safety-time out has been imposed. In a press statement on Thursday, MOM said the length of the safety time-out should also be “sufficiently long” to review risks corresponding to the scale of their operations.
The requirement - which will apply to all companies in the construction, manufacturing, marine, process or transport and storage industries as well as industries that use heavy or industrial vehicles - was among a slew of new measures introduced on Thursday to tackle rising workplace fatalities.
Since the start of the year, Singapore has reported 36 workplace fatalities, of which five occurred last month. 
In comparison, there were 37 fatalities recorded for the whole of last year and 30 in 2020.
Speaking to reporters at a media briefing on Thursday, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said while he understands that companies are still adjusting to the new work tempo, workplace safety cannot be compromised.
“Companies cannot put safety on the backburner just to catch up on work progress or as they ramp up business activity. The bottom line is that we cannot put our workers lives at risk and we have to set our baseline with zero tolerance to fatalities and injuries,” he said.
“This is very important to us.”
Calling on company leaders to do more to protect their workers, he said: “You are in the best position to set a positive workplace safety and health culture and shape safety practices on the ground.”
“Any disruptions that you face as a result of lax safety practices are temporary, but the impact of injuries and fatalities on the workers and their families are permanent.”

Developers urged to pay contractors safety bonus as workplace accidents rise













To strengthen workplace safety, MOM introduced a six-month “heightened safety” period, which takes effect from Thursday till Feb 28. 
Under this, companies who are found to have serious workplace safety lapses as well as their senior management will be held more accountable. 
Among the new measures, companies with unsafe workplace conditions or poor risk controls following serious or fatal workplace accidents may be debarred from employing new foreign employees for up to three months.
Chief executives of these companies will also be required to personally account to MOM and take responsibility for rectifications.
Pointing out that more than half of workplace fatalities and injuries this year involved small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Mr Zaqy said MOM will expand the scale of an existing programme that provides SMEs with access to consultants who can help them identify safety and health risks at the workplace and implement good practices.
Between January and June, MOM took enforcement action against more than 9,000 workplace safety breaches - double the number of such breaches in the same period last year.
TARGETED MEASURES FOR CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
With the construction sector being a top contributor of workplace fatalities and serious injuries, targeted measures to strengthen workplace safety within the sector will kick in from next month. 
This includes lowering the threshold for issuing demerit points under an existing system implemented in the construction sector, meaning that more demerit points will be issued for workplace safety breaches.
The revised demerit point system also means that errant companies with consistently poor safety performance will reach the penalty thresholds more quickly, resulting in being debarred from hiring foreign employees for up to two years. 
From Oct 1, all public sector construction tenders will include a new, harmonised set of disqualification criteria. This will temporarily disqualify contractors with poor workplace safety and health performance from participating in these tenders. 
Finally, a multi-sectoral task force chaired by Mr Zaqy will be set up to strengthen workplace safety practices and outcomes. This will be advised by an external experts panel comprising industry representatives and WSH consultants. 
National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong said NTUC supports the imposition of the mandatory safety time-out for high-risk sectors and for companies that use heavy or industrial vehicles.
""We also welcome the funding support for SMEs to engage workplace safety and health consultants to enhance their safety practices,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.
He said that NTUC hopes MOM would consider expanding the mandatory safety time-out to more sectors. 
""The review of the company’s workplace safety and health systems and processes during the safety time-out should involve all stakeholders, from the management team to workers and unions, as well as subcontractors and suppliers,"" Mr Yong added.
He also asked MOM to consider requiring all companies in high-risk sectors to conduct a workplace safety and health audit - done by an external auditor - as part of the safety time out."
"'No clear evidence' Joseph Schooling, Amanda Lim were taking drugs; no preferential treatment given: Shanmugam","The two swimmers returned negative urine tests, and Lim was warned for having a ""drug utensil"", says the Home Affairs Minister.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shanmugam-joseph-schooling-amanda-lim-drugs-utensil-cnb-2914856,"SINGAPORE: There was ""no clear evidence"" that national swimmers Joseph Schooling and Amanda Lim were taking drugs at the time of testing, said Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam on Thursday (Sep 1).
Speaking on the sidelines of a launch of an AIBI Maxwell wellness facility, he added that the duo were not given any favourable or preferential treatment and were treated like others in similar situations.
It was revealed on Tuesday that Schooling and Lim had been investigated by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) for possible offences related to the consumption of cannabis.
The evidence was inconclusive and their urine tests were negative, Mr Shanmugam wrote earlier in a Facebook post explaining steps taken against the duo.
Schooling and Lim however were ""honest"" and admitted to having taken drugs in the past, said the Home Affairs Minister.
He added that Lim, 29, had a ""drug utensil"" and received a warning for that. 
















As a full-time national serviceman (NSF), Schooling, 27, was handed over to the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) to decide on steps to be taken.
Some members of the public may think that this mistake by Schooling and Lim would ""sort of erase"" all of their achievements, Mr Shanmugam told journalists on Thursday.
""I think most Singaporeans won't agree with that. Their achievements are tremendous, they have given much and they have much to give with their dedication, their energy, their focus, and one mistake doesn't erase all of that,"" he added.
""If I were to tell Singaporeans, 20 years ago someone committed an offence by taking drugs when they were in university overseas. Do Singaporeans expect that such a person would be subjected to DRC (drug rehabilitation centre)?"" said Mr Shanmugam.
This is still an offence because there is no time limit or statutory bar, he noted.
""But one takes an approach to these things. If there is current consumption, one approach is taken. If there is no evidence of current consumption, another approach is taken.""

Singapore swimmer Joseph Schooling confesses to consuming cannabis overseas: MINDEF













Mr Shanmugam also wrote on Facebook that some members of the public had asked why Lim was let off with a warning and no action was taken against Schooling by CNB, given Singapore's tough anti-drug policies. 
""We are very tough on drug traffickers and those involved in the drug trade. That includes imposing capital punishment,"" said the Home Affairs Minister.
""This is in contrast to how we treat pure drug abusers, who haven't committed any other offence. Since 2019, our approach is to treat such pure drug abusers as persons who really need help."" 
These people will not be imprisoned or have a criminal record even though consumption is an offence, said Mr Shanmugam, who is also Minister for Law. 
""Instead, we take steps to help them rehabilitate, which could include DRC or supervision. This would help them to reintegrate into society more quickly and effectively."" 
The Government does not send people to a DRC or even give warnings if there is no positive test, or if they are not currently taking drugs, he stressed. 
""But also note: If there is clear evidence of current use of drugs, then CNB will take steps, regardless of whether the consumption took place in Singapore or overseas,"" said Mr Shanmugam.
""So don't assume that if you consume drugs overseas, you will be let off with a warning."" 
Schooling, who is Singapore's first and only Olympic champion, confessed to consuming cannabis while overseas in May.

"Tuas Port opens officially, will be 'critical engine' driving Singapore's economy: PM Lee","Tuas Port will be the ""port of the future"" anchoring the upcoming Western Gateway. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tuas-port-opens-critical-engine-lee-hsien-loong-ceremony-2914426,"SINGAPORE: Tuas Port, which will anchor the future Western Gateway, officially opened on Thursday (Sep 1) with three berths operational.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hailed the mega project as a port of the future and a critical engine driving Singapore's economy.
In his speech at the opening ceremony, Mr Lee said Tuas Port will position Singapore well to ""support the growth in maritime traffic and global trade and strengthen our connectivity and capability to provide efficient and reliable services"". 
""It will reinforce our status as an international maritime centre, and enable many related industries to flourish,"" said Mr Lee. 
Tuas Port, expected to be the world's largest fully automated port upon completion, can accommodate the world's largest container ships and will be able to handle larger vessels built in the future. It will also be able to manage a larger number and greater density of vessel movements safely and efficiently.
The mega port will also anchor the future Western Gateway, serving nearby industries at the Jurong Lake District, Jurong Innovation District, and Jurong and Tuas industrial areas.
""Being closer to the port means faster and cheaper port services and turnaround. It means more efficient production for their products to be exported to international markets. Sectors such as advanced manufacturing, cold-chain, e-commerce, and logistics will benefit the most,"" said Mr Lee. 
Reclamation works for the first phase of the mega port project were completed late last year, with reclamation works for Phase 2 under way.  
Mr Lee had said at this year's National Day Rally that the Government decided to consolidate all port operations at the existing Tanjong Pagar, Brani, Keppel and Pasir Panjang terminals into one mega port at Tuas. 
The shift will free up prime waterfront land from Shenton Way to Pasir Panjang for the future Greater Southern Waterfront.

Thursday morning's ceremony was also attended by container port operator PSA International group chairman Peter Voser, ministers, as well as industry stakeholders. 
Apart from being a strategic point, Tuas Port will also create more opportunities and better jobs for workers, Mr Lee said in his speech. 
""PSA already has a professional and trained team. They will continue to train and upgrade their staff... to handle the next generation of hardware and software deployed at the port,"" Mr Lee said. 
Port workers have embraced new technologies and skills which will improve their productivity and make their jobs more comfortable and attractive, according to Mr Lee. 
Mr Lee stressed that the port plays a critical role in connecting Singapore to the global economy, noting that one third of the global container trade and a quarter of the global seaborne oil trade passes through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore annually. 
Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, stakeholders worked tirelessly to keep the Port of Singapore open and running smoothly 24 hours a day, Mr Lee noted. Singapore served as the ""catch-up port"" that shippers and shipping lines went to in order to resolve operational challenges. 
Mr Lee stressed that the hard work must continue in providing efficient and reliable services in this ""critical artery of trade between East and West"", in order to connect Southeast Asia to the rest of the world.
""That is how Singapore established ourselves as the world’s busiest transhipment port,"" said Mr Lee. 
Tuas Port, due to be completed in the 2040s, will be able to handle 65 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) annually, double the current capacity of Singapore's port."
New digital bank by Standard Chartered and NTUC to launch savings account and ‘numberless’ credit card,"Trust Bank is the latest digital bank to announce its launch in Singapore.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/trust-new-digital-bank-standard-chartered-ntuc-numberless-credit-card-2914351,"SINGAPORE: Trust Bank, the latest digital bank to announce its launch in Singapore, said on Thursday (Sep 1) that it is rolling out a range of products including a savings account and a “numberless” credit card that allows customers to choose their repayment date.
The savings account will offer a “market-leading” base rate and allow customers to earn up to 1.4 per cent of interest on their deposits, said the new bank formed by Standard Chartered and FairPrice Group.
The base rate is 1 per cent on the first S$50,000 of deposits, with NTUC Union Members getting to enjoy a bonus interest of 0.4 per cent when they make five eligible purchases with the bank’s credit card. Non-members will enjoy a bonus interest of 0.2 per cent on the same purchases.
Chief executive officer Dwaipayan Sadhu told reporters that the bank currently offers “one of the highest” base rates for savings accounts. While the bank reviews its rates on a weekly or monthly basis depending on market developments and overall interest rate movements, it has no plans to make adjustments to its rates anytime soon.
“One of the things that we pride ourselves on is that we must have a sustainable offer which we will be able to sustain over time,” he said.
The new bank's “numberless” card will offer the dual functionality of a credit and debit card. Cardholders will not have to pay fees, such as an annual fee and foreign transaction fee, and will be able to choose their repayment date.
In addition as a promotional launch rate until December, the digital bank is giving up to 21 per cent NTUC Linkpoints rebates on its credit card for NTUC members and 15 per cent savings for non-members.
Trust Bank is also offering a family personal accident insurance developed by Income. This comes at a premium of S$0.50 per month and has no limit to the number of dependents covered. The policy will be available at no premiums for the first two months when a customer signs up for the bank’s credit card.
These products, which will be available via the bank’s app, were built based on “extensive feedback” received during its user testing period.
The new bank is touting a “differentiated customer experience”, with customers being able to sign up “in minutes” with their SingPass accounts and use their digital cards immediately.
Speaking at the launch, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said Trust Bank will add to the diversity of the local banking system and help strengthen Singapore’s digital economy.
He added that the launch is timely, as it comes amid an acceleration in the society’s adoption of digital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“With this greater digital adoption in financial services, there is much potential for the banking sector to relook how to do things differently and serve customers better,” Mr Wong said, noting how digital banks can reach out to under-served segments better with the use of data and technology. 
Mr Wong also encouraged the new virtual bank to protect customers from ever-evolving banking scams and maintain a high level of data security.

Trust Bank, which is 60 per cent owned by Standard Chartered and 40 per cent by NTUC’s enterprise arm, obtained a full bank licence in December 2020. The bank’s shareholders have invested about S$400 million. 
 
The launch comes a day after Grab and Singtel, which have jointly been awarded a ""digital full bank"" licence, unveiled their digital bank – GXS – and its first product.
 Technology firm Sea holds the other ""digital full bank"" licence issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) nearly two years ago, as part of liberalising the financial industry.
 
The MAS also gave out two licences for digital wholesale banks targeting small- and medium-size enterprises and other non-retail segments. Both virtual banks – Ant's ANEXT Bank and the Green Link Digital Bank – have launched in June.
 
In general, virtual banks offer services that one can expect from conventional banks, such as accepting deposits, loans, facilitating payments and loans, except that these will be performed online as digital banks do not have physical branches.

TO HAVE ATMS, CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTRE
But to cater to existing needs for cash bills, Trust Bank will have its own ATMs, said Mr Sadhu who described this as “a very big” differentiator from its competitors who operate fully online.
“We want (customers) to move entirely cashless. We want them to move fully digital, but it's a journey. While cash usage is coming down, there are still some places where you need cash,” he told reporters.
Trust Bank’s ATM will be located in the FairPrice outlet at VivoCity. Customers can also access their accounts through Standard Chartered’s ATMs across Singapore.
The new bank aims to be “as inclusive as possible” and is hoping to attract all segments of customers in Singapore, including those from the older generation.
Noting that there remains a “small set of customers who may not be very digitally comfortable yet”, Mr Sadhu said a customer experience centre will be set up at VivoCity’s FairPrice outlet in the coming weeks.
“This customer experience centre is not a bank branch. We do not accept cash. We do not accept cheques, we do not do any of the banking transactions,” he stressed.
“What this does is it takes the client on the digital journey. It shows the client how to sign up, how to safely and securely (access) digital banking, and essentially answers questions (a customer) may have towards a digital bank.” 
The latest digital bank entrant currently has 200 full-time employees and intends to hire more as it expands its products and services.
Ms Judy Hsu, Standard Chartered's chief executive officer of consumer, private and business banking described the digital bank’s initial products as a “well-rounded suite of savings, credit and protection solutions coupled with rewarding lifestyle offers and benefits”.
“By integrating Trust's digital-first services seamlessly into customers' everyday lives, Trust is making banking accessible, secured and effortless for everyone,” she added.
FairPrice Group’s chairman Kee Teck Koon said: “Trust's credit card and savings account will empower our customers to enjoy savings from groceries to food and everyday spend via seamless integration with FairPrice Group's Link Rewards programme, while benefitting NTUC union members with an easier way to earn higher Linkpoint rebates and savings account interest. 
“Together with the trusted partnership of Standard Chartered, we are confident that the synergies created through our combined strengths and heritage will make Trust's banking solutions convenient and accessible for all.”"
2 dead after car and bus collide at Woodlands junction,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/2-dead-car-bus-woodlands-road-traffic-accident-honda-civic-tower-transit-2914436,"SINGAPORE: Two people died after an accident between a car and a Tower Transit bus at the junction of Woodlands Avenue 9 and Woodlands Avenue 4 early on Thursday (Sep 1) morning. 
A 32-year-old man driving the car was pronounced dead at the scene.
Nine others were taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), which was alerted to the accident at about 6.10am.
One was a 37-year-old bus driver and the other eight were bus passengers, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF). 
One of the passengers, a 53-year-old woman, subsequently died in hospital. 
The police said investigations are ongoing.
















Videos shared with CNA show a yellow Honda Civic car with its front crumpled against the side of a Tower Transit bus, with two blue police tents next to the vehicles.
Tower Transit told CNA it was looking for the next-of-kin of the woman who died, to provide them with assistance.
It is also in the process of contacting the bus driver and the other passengers to check on their well-being, and to assist with medical claims. 
""Our bus captain is in a stable condition and will be relieved of all duties while a police investigation is being conducted,"" added Tower Transit.
The bus operator also thanked members of the public who helped the bus driver and passengers, and expressed its condolences to the family of the deceased."
"NParks says dead blacktip reef sharks likely caught in gill net, reminds public about sustainable fishing methods","Eight blacktip reef sharks were found dead, with their gills damaged, in the waters off Pulau Hantu on Sunday morning. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/blacktip-sharks-dead-pulau-hantu-gill-net-sustainable-fishing-nparks-2914116,"SINGAPORE: The eight blacktip reef sharks found dead in waters off Pulau Hantu were likely caught in a gill net, said the National Parks Board (NParks) on Wednesday night (Aug 31).
This was based on the online images, description of the injuries and the location of the carcasses provided by divers who found them, said Dr Karenne Tun, director of NParks’ National Biodiversity Centre, in response to CNA’s queries.
She added that the observation was in line with that of non-profit conservation group Marine Stewards.
There was no sample collected from the carcasses during the dive, said Dr Tun.
More than 100 species of fish, including the blacktip reef sharks, are found in the waters. “To protect our native marine biodiversity, NParks encourages members of the public to carry out responsible recreational fishing at designated fishing spots, using more sustainable fishing methods,” said Dr Tun.
There are various fishing gear and methods, ranging from hook, rod and line, fish traps and nets, each varying in its impact on the environment, she added.
“Fish traps and nets tend to be more indiscriminate and when lost in the sea, will continue to trap and kill fish and other marine life.
“For this reason, net fishing and the use of wire mesh traps are not allowed in areas managed by NParks,” said Dr Tun.
Areas such as the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Labrador Nature Reserve’s rocky shore, Chek Jawa Wetlands, waters around Coney Island Park and Admiralty Park have been designated as ""no fishing"" spots and are managed as sanctuaries for fish.

NParks is also working closely with fishing communities to promote responsible fishing. Pamphlets on sustainable fishing practices have also been distributed to shops, boating marinas and fishers, said Dr Tun.
“Together with the Friends of Marine Park Community, NParks engage anglers through the Marine Stewards Singapore to promote best practices for recreational fishing,” she added.
This includes practising voluntary catch-and-release fishing, where fish, especially juveniles as well as endangered and threatened species, are released back into the sea if not to be eaten.
Signboards have also been put up at popular recreational fishing areas like Bedok Jetty to educate fishers and encourage best practices, said Dr Tun.
The blacktip reef sharks were found dead on Sunday morning with their gills damaged. Divers found the carcasses of the juvenile sharks during a routine dive at Pulau Hantu, which is located off the south of Singapore.
Marine Stewards said in a Facebook post that several divers counted the sharks, all at around the same area - Hantu Jetty - at a depth of 10 to 11m.
Photos posted on its Facebook page showed the dead sharks with their gills ripped or shredded.
A Marine Stewards spokesperson previously told CNA that according to the diver's accounts, all the sharks had damage to their gill areas.
The spokesperson had added that gill nets are ""generally an indiscriminate killer"" and catch anything that passes through.

"159,000 low-wage workers will earn at least S$1,400 from Sep 1",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/local-qualifying-salary-lqs-low-wage-workers-mom-2913021,"SINGAPORE: About 159,000 lower-wage workers will earn at least S$1,400 under a new local qualifying salary (LQS) requirement that kicks in on Thursday (Sep 1).
These are workers who are not in sectors covered by the progressive wage model (PWM).
Part-time local workers will also benefit from the new LQS requirement, as they will need to be paid at least S$9 in gross wages per hour.
LQS has been revised four times in the last five years and has risen from S$1,000 in 2016, to S$1,400. Employers will need to pay all their local workers at least S$1,400 in order to hire any foreign worker.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in last year's National Day Rally that the PWM and other measures to raise the salaries of lower-wage workers will be rolled out to more people, extending to eight in 10 lower-wage workers over the next few years.
Two other changes to wage schemes will also take effect on Sep 1.
First, the retail progressive wage model will be implemented, benefitting about 19,000 full-time retail workers, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a press release on Wednesday.
The ministry added the entry-level retail PWM wage will grow 18 per cent over a three-year period.

Second, the PWM for cleaning, security and landscape sectors - which originally applied only to outsourced workers - will be extended to cover those working in-house as well. This benefit about 19,000 full-time lower-wage workers, said MOM.
In total, 197,000 full-time lower-wage workers will benefit from the new progressive wage moves. This includes the new LQS requirement, and the introduction of the PWM for retail workers, as well as for in-house cleaners, security officers and landscape workers.
MOM said that employers are required to assess if their workers are performing a job role covered by a PWM by referring to the PWM job descriptions on MOM’s website. Employers must then update and submit their workers’ PWM job roles, if any, through MOM’s Occupational Employment Dataset portal.
From September 2022 to February 2023, tripartite partners will focus on educating employers on the various progressive wage requirements, with employers given time to adjust and comply, said MOM.
To support employers as they adjust to the progressive wage requirements, the Government is co-funding the wage increases given to lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS), said MOM. 
The PWCS will run for five years from 2022 to 2026. 
Employers are urged to use this period of support from the Government to accelerate firm-level productivity improvements, so that the wage increases remain sustainable for employers in the long run, said MOM."
How do schools deal with students who become aggressive? Teachers speak out after St Andrew's incident,"A range of disciplinary actions – including counselling, suspension and caning – can be used to punish students who become aggressive towards teachers, educators tell CNA.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/st-andrews-secondary-school-teachers-scolded-vulgarities-discipline-students-2905121,"SINGAPORE: If a student becomes aggressive in class, whether it is shouting, spewing vulgarities – or threatening a teacher like in the St Andrew's incident – teachers say they use various strategies to try to calm the situation.
""Once you get into such power struggles, it is usually more difficult for both parties to back down,"" said Alan, a teacher who deals with discipline in his school.
Another teacher who has a rapport with the student in question may be called in to help calm things down, he said.
The student may be isolated so that he can reflect on his actions. The teacher involved would later visit the student with another neutral party. 
Another teacher who wanted to be known as Jamie said that punishing a student immediately does not address the root of the problem.
""What we try and teach them is about understanding what your actions are and what are the possible consequences,"" said Jamie, who has been teaching for 11 years. 
""The restorative process is important because it cannot be just the teacher sending the student out. In the end, we need to get the teacher to understand the student's perspective and the student to understand the teacher's perspective and then agree to move forward,"" Alan said. 
There will then be disciplinary consequences, he added. 
The names of teachers interviewed for this story have been changed at their request as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Most teachers that CNA spoke to said violent threats from students, such as those that surfaced in a video recently, are rare. 
In the viral video, a St Andrew's Secondary School student is seen confronting a staff member and threatening to end the teacher's life. 
The school said in response to media queries that it takes ""a serious view on disrespectful behaviour towards staff"", and has disciplined the student involved. 
RUDENESS TO TEACHERS NOT CONDONED: MOE
The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to queries from CNA that schools promote a safe and supportive environment for all students to prevent ""challenging behaviours"" that disrupt learning.
""Despite preventive measures, some students may, from time to time, display inappropriate behaviours,"" MOE said, adding that it provides schools with guidelines to formulate their discipline policies. 
""Rudeness to teachers is not condoned. It is considered student misbehaviour and hence firmly dealt with, according to the schools’ disciplinary guidelines,"" the ministry said. 
""When teachers experience incidents of open defiance, they will be supported by their school leaders and the student management team, who will assist to investigate the incident, engage parents of the student and mete out consequences where appropriate.""

St Andrew's Secondary School student disciplined after threatening to 'end' staff member's life



















Disciplinary action taken against students seen fighting in video, says MOE; police investigations ongoing 













DISCIPLINARY OPTIONS AVAILABLE
In the wake of the St Andrew's incident, many social media users asked what disciplinary methods schools and teachers can take against students who misbehave. 
Schools may institute detention, suspension and corrective community service, depending on the circumstances of each case, MOE said.
""For serious offences, as a last resort, caning may be carried out for boys,"" it said.
A police report will be made for certain offences as required under the Criminal Procedure Code, MOE said. These offences include housebreaking, murder and voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery. Appropriate support will be given to ensure the well-being of the student under police investigation, it added.
Students being aggressive towards teachers is not uncommon, especially in secondary schools, teachers told CNA. 
The teachers said that when an incident involving a teacher happens, the school's disciplinary committee would typically be informed. Counselling usually goes hand in hand with other disciplinary actions, they added. 
Some schools require both the teacher and student to write a statement. 
Parents are also informed. The school then has some options in deciding on the disciplinary action, depending on how minor or major the offence is. 
Students may be let off with a warning, especially if it's their first time displaying such behaviour. 
""More often than not, an apology to the affected party will be part of the consequences,"" Jamie said. 
It could be a personal apology or apologising to the class in a formal setting attended by the discipline master, she said. 
""This is definitely one of the things that I have seen happen, which is useful because you put them back in the same position where they disrupted and then tried to assert power … the seriousness of the situation will not be taken away,"" she said. 
When it comes to repeat offences, in-house suspension is an option.
This means that students will have to turn up in school but do not go to classes or join their friends during recess, the teachers said. They also may not be able to represent their school in competitions. 
""For some students, that works because they need the classroom environment, they need their friends. So it's torture for them to know that they cannot do recess with their friends but they are still in school,"" said Rachel, who has been teaching for more than 10 years. 
They may also be asked not to turn up in school at all, which means an at-home suspension. 
While caning is also an option for boys, the teachers who spoke to CNA said this is typically done in private, and that it doesn't happen often in their schools. 
""Nowadays it's angling less and less towards caning. So it's more the route of counselling, suspension, reflection,"" said Nick, who has been a teacher for nine years. 
At Alan's school, the disciplinary action depends on the student's intent and his offence. 
""For example, if your intention right from the start is to cause hurt and then you really cause hurt – we may cane, we may suspend,"" he said. 
TEACHERS CAN LOSE THEIR COOL TOO
When such incidents happen, teachers may have difficulties containing their emotions, Rachel said. 
Once, a student shouted at her to ""watch her tone"" when she reprimanded him.
""When a student raises his or her voice at the teacher, it is normal for the teacher to raise our voice as well. So it's very hard for us to really calm ourselves down and talk normally because it's unexpected that they speak to us like this,"" she said. 
Similarly, Nick said that while being the adult and a professional in the situation means that they must know how to handle themselves, it is not always easy. 
""We have to know how to remove ourselves from such situations, but you know, arguments can happen … that's the risky thing for teachers,""  he said. 
""So if that happens and it's recorded, we are always in trouble first because we are the adults, but it doesn't mean that teachers don't lose their cool.""
He added that some parents can be defensive regardless of the situation. 
""The parent may keep saying 'oh but your teacher did this, your teacher did that', so parents also sometimes don't make it easy,"" he said. 
While they are not the norm, such parents make things a ""nightmare"" for schools.

HELPING STUDENTS 
Issues relating to discipline are often ""multi-faceted"", the Education Ministry said, adding that collaboration involving schools, parents and the community is essential to instil and reinforce the right values and behaviour in students.
Schools put in effort to identify and help students who are known to show aggressive behaviour, and who may or may not be diagnosed with disorders like oppositional defiant disorder, teachers said.
Things may be tackled upstream when it comes to students who have been identified with behavioural issues, Alan said. 
This includes telling the teacher how to manage the child and if the teacher needs support, where to get the support, he said. 
The school may also go as far as planning deployment such that a teacher the student likes and listens to will teach them. 
 
Rachel said that teachers also make an effort to gain students' respect and trust. 
This includes looking out for talent – in sports for instance – that the students may have and encouraging them to pursue these activities, she said. 
""A lot of soft approach is needed. For example, some of the kids don't have money to eat, so you buy for them food,"" she said."

""In turn, I think they now deserve our empathy and understanding as they seek to bounce back from this difficult episode.
""I have said before – we cannot be fairweather fans.  Let’s get behind our swimmers, and back them to now make it right.""
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Defence said that Schooling had admitted to consuming cannabis overseas in May when he was on short-term disruption from full-time National Service to train and participate in the Southeast Asian Games.
Separately, Sport Singapore (SportSG) said that Lim had received a stern warning from CNB under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
It added that it would ""thoroughly review the circumstances behind these cases, and determine the appropriate steps to be taken thereafter""."
'Every one of us has multiple identities and they’re precious': Diversity and identity core themes in George Yeo's new book,"Singapore's former Minister for Foreign Affairs, George Yeo, has published a new book comprising reflections on topics from politics to philosophy. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/george-yeo-book-launch-diversity-identity-politics-philosophy-2912541,"SINGAPORE: While diversity is Singapore's strength, not knowing how to handle the tension created by diversity can divide us, said former foreign minister George Yeo on Wednesday (Aug 31) at the launch of his new book. 
""The diversity of the world is reflected in Singapore and it creates naturally a tension. If we don't manage this tension well, it can divide us,"" he said. 
Titled George Yeo: Musings – Series One, the themes of diversity and identity heavily underpin the 480-page book containing his personal reflections on a range of topics from politics to philosophy. 
Taking on a conversational and anecdotal style, the book marks the first in a series of three, with the following two to be launched in the coming months. 
Mr Yeo retired from politics after his People’s Action Party team at Aljunied GRC lost to the Workers’ Party team during the 2011 General Election. He is now a visiting scholar at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the founding patron of its Asia Competitiveness Institute.

Commentary: Singapore must send a bold signal to attract global talent



















Commentary: Will new work pass make top talent ‘sit up, pay attention’ to Singapore?













“SINGAPORE MUST NEVER BECOME A HOTEL” 
At the book launch on Wednesday, an audience member highlighted the new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass aimed to attract top talent. He asked how Singapore could strike a balance between bringing in diverse foreign talent while ensuring those who identify as Singaporeans continue to feel like they belong. 
In response, Mr Yeo admitted he had wrestled with this question across all three series. 
“I don’t think the debate will ever cease in Singapore because we live by our connections to the world, and our connections to the world are based upon the world being reflected in us,” he said, explaining that this diversity would naturally create tension. 
“Singapore must never become a hotel; Singapore must always be a home. And (even as) we keep our doors open, we should never have it so open that those who are in the home no longer feel like they’re living in their own house but living in a hotel. Then we’ve gone too far. We have to strike a balance,” he added. 
“But if we shut the doors and windows … then we kill ourselves. Striking this balance is the Singapore spirit.” 
Along the same vein, Mr Yeo had referred to “citizenship tests” in his book, although he clarified that we should not understand this literally. 
“The important thing is, when we accept new citizens, we’re accepting them (into) our family ... We must find a way to create a process where Singaporeans are in the loop in accepting those who become citizens. It should not only be done by bureaucrats. It should not only be done according to rules or how much they’re prepared to invest,” he explained.
“There is an emotional component involved … which is vital. Otherwise we’re no longer a home. We must create a process which incorporates this into the citizenship approval process.” 
YOUNG SINGAPOREANS SHOULD TRAVEL IN THE REGION 
One way young Singaporeans can foster a greater appreciation for diversity would be to travel in the region, Mr Yeo encouraged. 
In response to a question from a young audience member about how young people could develop greater appreciation for vastly different cultures, Mr Yeo noted the tendency for more young Singaporeans to head to Europe, Japan or Korea. They also tend to prefer learning European languages, Japanese or Korean, as compared to regional languages.  
“It’s partly a holdover from the past, because they were dominant so we held them to be higher cultures, higher languages to which we aspire,” he said. 
“If we look forward, the region will become much more important to us. And it’ll be good if among some students, there are those who show greater interest in the region and all its wonderful diversity, and to recognise these countries as part of who we are and what we are.” 
Mr Yeo added that effort and a “certain change in mentality” is required to change this. 
“If we succeed in changing the culture a little bit, the situation will improve. But even if we don’t, reality will force us to change, because the region will become more important to us. And by necessity, we’ll be forced to learn more about the region. Because if we don’t, we’ll suffer consequences,” he said.

IDENTITY “VERY IMPORTANT AND PRECIOUS” TO EVERY PERSON
Reflections on Mr Yeo’s relationship with his personal identity are also scattered throughout the book, put together by writer and veteran media practitioner Woon Tai Ho and research assistant Keith Yap. 
“This first series is about identity. … Our identity as Singaporeans and as Chinese, Indians, Malays, Muslims, Hindus, as Christians. Identity is very important and precious in each and every one of us,” said Mr Yeo. 
Explaining the significance of identity in his life, Mr Yeo highlighted a reference made in the second chapter of his book about comments he received from the late Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee had been concerned that Mr Yeo was Catholic and Teochew. 
“Maybe too Catholic and too Teochew. ... When he expressed that concern, it bothered me a lot. Because these things are very important to me. And when it bothers you, it bothers me,” recalled Mr Yeo. 
“I reflected on this subject over many years, and decided that each and every one of us has multiple identities and they’re precious. If they’re not important to you, that’s fine. But if it’s important to you, I respect you – and the more I respect you, the more you respect me. And that’s what human society is. Which is why we’re created as individuals, not as categories.” 
Mr Woon, who was also present at the book launch, understood why many people have said it was a pity that Mr Yeo wasn’t in politics anymore – but his involvement in the book helped him see that Mr Yeo was able to contribute in other significant and different ways outside of politics. 
“In this book, the current affairs of Singapore, the region and the world has been made grippingly lucid by the sharp eye of a scholar of history. … And (Mr Yeo’s) answers will make you think, reflect, and most importantly, make you more interested in your own life and your own existence,” he said. 
George Yeo: Musings – Series One is published by World Scientific, and is sold at all major bookstores including Kinokuniya and Popular."
"Government will ensure growth remains inclusive, even as Singapore welcomes talent and investments: DPM Lawrence Wong",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/government-will-ensure-growth-remains-inclusive-even-singapore-welcomes-talent-and-investments-dpm-lawrence-wong-2912951,"SINGAPORE: Even as Singapore opens its door to more foreign talents and investments, the Government will ensure that growth remains inclusive, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Aug 31). 
Earlier this week, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced a new work pass, which will allow high-earners and high-achievers to live in Singapore without having to secure a job here first.
Speaking in an interview on Channel 5’s News Tonight, Mr Wong said while it is an existential for Singapore to remain open, the benefits of being a global city must also be shared across all segments of society.
“We will, at the same time, have to do more to assure Singaporeans that even as we welcome talent and investments into Singapore, we will always ensure that growth remains inclusive,” said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.
This includes regulating the flow of foreigners into Singapore and ensuring that they complement Singaporeans at the workplace.
Mr Wong said efforts to integrate foreigners especially at the workplace must also be strengthened to help them understand Singapore's values and way of life.
At the same time, Singaporeans must also embrace foreigners who are contributing to Singapore, he said.
Highlighting the tremendous contributions made by migrant workers as well as the challenges they faced during the pandemic, Mr Wong said: “If we look at things from their perspective and how much sacrifices and contributions they have made, hopefully, Singaporeans ourselves will be big-hearted and will embrace them because they are making important contributions to us as well.”

During the wide-ranging interview, Mr Wong also spoke about the need to strengthen the sense of cohesion and solidarity among Singaporeans.
“Fault lines exist and we take them very seriously because we can see in other places how race, religion, and identity become entrenched as fundamental ideologies,” he said, adding that can result in societies becoming more divided and polarised.
“We have not reached that stage and we are not like that yet in Singapore, and I hope we will never get there.”
“That's the whole reason why we must continue to focus on the common ground that we have,” he added.
Turning to the changing geopolitical situation, Mr Wong called for Singaporeans to be more vigilant and united against foreign influence, as the country’s sovereignty and the Government’s ability to do what is right for its people are at stake.
“In a more contested geopolitical space, we must expect external actors to conduct influence operations around the world and in Singapore,” he said.
“They will try to push out their views in our community and shape public opinion in the hope that public opinion, in turn, will nudge and influence the government to adopt certain positions.”
“If that were to happen, it basically means that the government will not be able to act in the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans, because we will end up acting in the interest of other countries,” said Mr Wong."
"Outrage of modesty cases a key concern, say police amid push to fight such crimes on public transport","There were 773 cases of outrage of modesty in the first half of 2022, a 4.6% increase compared to the same period last year.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/outrage-modesty-cases-molest-public-transport-singapore-police-force-2912566,"SINGAPORE: Crimes involving outrage of modesty continue to be a key concern for Singapore police amid a rise in the number of such cases.
There were 773 outrage of modesty cases in the first half of this year, a 4.6 per cent increase from the figure of 739 in the same period in 2021, according to mid-year crime statistics released by the police.
""The number of outrage of modesty cases occurring within the public transport system, including public transportation nodes and on public transport, remains a concern,"" said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Wednesday (Aug 31).
Among the cases on the public transport network, 63.8 per cent involved victims aged between 13 and 29.
To raise awareness about such crimes, SPF said it will launch a new public education video at MRT stations.
""These advisories seek to educate the public on what they can do when they encounter such crime, and remind them to stay vigilant and report the matter to the police if they encounter anything suspicious,"" said SPF.
For instance, the information provided by victims who were quick to report cases has helped to solve many cases, said the police, adding that useful details include descriptions of suspects and the direction in which they travelled.
Giving an example of a case in March, SPF said a man was arrested two days after an incident at Woodlands MRT station. 
A 23-year-old woman had made a police report at about 1.10am, saying she was molested by an unknown man.
""The woman managed to take a photo of the man, which was useful information that she provided to the police when she reported the incident,"" said SPF, adding that it worked with the public transport operator to establish the suspect's identity through his travel pattern.
The man was sentenced to one week in jail on Mar 29.
The offence of outrage of modesty carries a jail term of up to three years, a fine, caning, or any combination of such punishments.
If the victim is under 14 years old, the maximum jail term could extend to five years.
The police advised members of the public to move away if possible if someone gets ""uncomfortably close"".
""Whenever possible, you may also approach the bus captains or MRT station staff for assistance if you are commuting via public transport nodes,"" the police added.
""Outrage of modesty cases remain a key concern for the police,"" said SPF.
""The police have zero tolerance towards sexual offenders who threaten the personal safety of the community and offenders will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law."""

Poh Zhenlong Caine had cheated 396 victims of more than S$108,000 on e-commerce platform Carousell, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Wednesday. 
SPF said it received numerous reports from victims who were cheated by purportedly different online sellers on Carousell from October 2018 to June 2020.
""These sellers advertised tickets for Universal Studios Singapore (USS), concerts, sporting events, and other items.
""After the victims had made payment via bank transfer, PayNow or Paylah, the sellers ceased communications and did not deliver the items.""
Investigations revealed that Poh had posted advertisements on Carousell purporting to sell the products, said SPF.
In particular, he had advertised tickets to USS, concerts and sporting events after noticing that there was a high demand for such tickets on Carousell.
""By such manner of deception, Poh dishonestly induced 396 victims to deliver $108,693.90 to various bank accounts,"" said SPF.
Poh pleaded guilty to two charges of cheating, four charges of amalgamated unlawful remote gambling and one charge of unlawful remote gambling.
SPF said it takes a serious view of persons who may be involved in scams and fraud, and perpetrators will be dealt with, in accordance with the law.
It also advised members of the public to be very careful when making online purchases and to opt for buyer protection by using in-built payment options that release payment to the seller only upon delivery.
""Whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller,"" said SPF.
""Scammers may entice buyers to contact them directly through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat by offering a better or faster deal if bank transfer payments are made directly to them. 
""They may also use a local bank account or provide a copy of an NRIC/driver’s licence to make you believe that they are genuine sellers.""
SPF also advised the public to purchase only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, especially for high-value items."

Travellers should expect delays and are advised to adjust their travel plans, where possible, to avoid being caught in traffic congestion, it added.
""We seek travellers’ understanding and cooperation to be patient, observe traffic rules, maintain lane discipline, and cooperate with officers on-site when using the land checkpoints.""
At the peak of the September school holiday in 2019, travellers departing and arriving by car via the land checkpoints had to wait up to one-and-a-half hours before they were cleared through immigration, said ICA.
Additionally, ICA said that traffic flow through Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints is gradually returning to pre-COVID-19 volume with ""more than 313,000 travellers clearing through both checkpoints per day over the recent weekend"".
This surpassed the last highest weekend travel volume during the National Day holiday, which saw 302,000 travellers per day, said ICA.
The authority advised travellers to factor in additional time for immigration clearance and avoid the following peak hours during the school holiday period:
Departing Singapore
Fridays (Sep 2 and 9) and Sundays (Sep 4 and 11), 6pm to 11.59pm
Monday (Sep 5), 10am to 12pm
Saturdays (Sep 3 and 10), 6am to 9am, 6pm to 11.59pm
Arriving in Singapore
Saturdays (Sep 3 and 10) and weekdays 10pm to 11.59pm 
Sundays (Sep 4 and 11), 6pm to 11.59pm
ICA said that it will take the necessary measures to facilitate immigration clearance without compromising security, adding that checkpoint officers monitor traffic conditions in real-time to ensure optimal deployment of resources. 
""We also work with the Traffic Police to ensure road discipline at the critical junctions leading to the land checkpoints."" 
Travellers leaving via Woodlands Checkpoint should note that the upgrading works on the arrival immigration car booths have been ongoing at Malaysia's Bangunan Sultan Iskandar since Jun 6. During this period, booths that are undergoing upgrading will not be operational.
ICA also advised motorist to check the traffic situation at the land checkpoints through the Land Transport Authority (LTA)’s One Motoring website or via the Expressway Monitoring & Advisory System (EMAS) installed along the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) respectively.
Motorists can also get updates on the traffic situation at both land checkpoints through ICA’s Facebook and Twitter accounts."

Sponsor Hugo Boss stands by Joseph Schooling as experts say it's not end of the line for his brand
Olympic champion Joseph Schooling’s admission of drug use might have tarnished his reputation, but brand experts that CNA spoke to say he still has a chance to repair his image and bounce back.
One of his sponsors, Hugo Boss, affirmed that its partnership and support for Schooling remains ""strong and unwavered"".
What is needed next is for him to explain why he did it, one communications expert said. Another said the saga could even make Schooling more relatable and more attractive as a partner for some brands.
Public opinion has been split, with some expressing sympathy for him while others called for him to be treated like any other person who has broken the law. 
Schooling has seen his fair share of ups and downs since winning Singapore's first Olympic gold medal. Here is a timeline of what has happened since.
Former Malaysia PM Mahathir in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19
Mahathir Mohamad, 97, has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been hospitalised for observation.
The former Malaysian prime minister has a history of heart problems and has had heart attacks and bypass surgeries.
He has received at least three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, with the last known shot in November 2021, according to earlier comments made by him and Malaysian government officials.
Japan further eases border controls for tourism, allowing non-guided package tours
Tourists will be able to visit Japan from next week on package tours without a guide. The move comes as the country moves to ease COVID-19 controls. From Sep 7, Japan will also raise its daily cap on the number of people allowed to enter from 20,000 to 50,000.
The measures fall short of a full reopening and visitors are still required to book their trips through agents and obtain visas.
Meanwhile, South Korea says it will end the pre-departure COVID-19 test rule for travellers to the country starting on Sep 3. However, they still need to take a PCR test within the first 24 hours of their arrival.
Last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ended the Cold War and won Nobel prize, dies aged 91
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, has died at the age of 91.
He forged partnerships with the West that brought down the Iron Curtain and ended the Cold War. But his internal reforms helped weaken the Soviet Union to the point where it fell apart, which Russian President Vladimir Putin called the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the century.
Gorbachev will be buried in Moscow's Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife Raisa. 
Reactions to his death in Russia were restrained, with some paying tribute to the hope he had brought, and others noting that the country was still dealing with the turbulence that his democratic and economic reforms unleashed. 
Najib's wife Rosmah files application to disqualify judge in her corruption trial as verdict looms
Rosmah Mansor filed an application seeking the removal of the judge who heard her corruption case. 
The wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak contended that she has lost faith in the judge's ability to hear her corruption case following the recent alleged leak of a judgment that purportedly pronounced her guilty in the matter.
She is facing three charges of soliciting and receiving bribes totalling RM194 million (US$43 million). The judge, Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, is set to deliver his verdict on Thursday.

"Man jailed after elderly father called police on him thrice for fighting, drunken behaviour",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-drunk-man-fight-commotion-elderly-father-call-police-thrice-2912201,"SINGAPORE: An elderly man called the police three times on his 50-year-old son, who fought and repeatedly caused a commotion while drunk. 
The son, Tan Hock Lai, was on Wednesday (Aug 31) jailed for four weeks.
He pleaded guilty to three charges of committing a public nuisance and disturbing the public peace. Another three charges were considered for sentencing.
The court heard that Tan and his 70-year-old father lived together in a flat on the ground floor of a public housing block.
Around 3am on Nov 2 last year, Tan returned home drunk and started throwing things around the flat. 
Tan's father was irritated by this and chased him out of the unit. Tan repeatedly banged on the door and window and shouted loudly, demanding to be let in.
His father called the police, telling them: ""My son every night drunk come and disturb me. I cannot stand it already.""
The police also received calls from residents nearby. When they arrived, Tan was still banging on the door and shouting loudly, and the window had been smashed. They arrested him.
Three days later, after drinking again, Tan got into a fight with a man at a ground floor staircase in Toa Payoh for no apparent reason, according to court documents.
The man was helping Tan to his feet after he tried to stand up but stumbled. Tan's phone fell out in the process, and he suddenly punched the man's head several times.
The man fended Tan off, but Tan adopted a boxing stance to challenge him. The man then retaliated by punching Tan's face.
The fight continued for about five minutes until the police arrived. Tan was arrested again as he kept trying to confront the other man while their statements were being taken.
In the last incident on Mar 24 this year, Tan returned home and asked his father for S$10. When his father refused, Tan started shouting loudly.
Exiting the flat, Tan threw some bamboo laundry poles and a laundry rack on the ground, and kicked over a dustbin.
The commotion attracted the neighbours' attention. When one of them told Tan to stop his antics, he went over to her flat and challenged her to a fight.
Police arrived shortly after and it was observed that Tan reeked heavily of alcohol.
Tan, who did not have a lawyer, was a food delivery rider at the time.
He told the court that he was emotionally affected by his wife's sudden request for a divorce when he committed the offences. Tan asked for a lighter sentence and told the judge that he would not reoffend.
The judge agreed with the prosecution on the length of the jail term to be imposed.
Those who commit a public nuisance can be jailed for up to three months or fined up to S$2,000.
The penalty for disturbing the peace by fighting in public is up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
"Public opinion on Schooling's cannabis confession split, some sympathetic while others call for fair treatment","After Joseph Schooling confessed to consuming cannabis overseas, many online commenters expressed sympathy while others called for the national swimmer to be treated like anyone else who has broken the law. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/joseph-schooling-cannabis-confession-sympathy-public-opinion-2911826,"SINGAPORE: Public opinion on Joseph Schooling’s confession that he consumed cannabis overseas has been split, with some expressing sympathy for his plight while others called for him to be treated like any other person who has broken the law. 
The incident happened in May when the Singaporean swimmer was on short-term disruption from National Service (NS) to train and participate in the SEA Games. 
Schooling's sporting privileges have been revoked, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on Tuesday (Aug 30). He will no longer be allowed to take leave or disrupt his NS to train and compete.
Many online commenters said that while the swim star made a mistake, he might have been going through a hard time and expressed sympathy for his situation. 
Some also said that they were satisfied with his apology, as he promised to take responsibility for his actions. 
""Joseph Schooling has apologised, and that takes courage. His apology makes me think even more highly of him as a person,"" said Facebook user AT Pasteur in a comment on CNA's Facebook page. 
""Besides, we have no idea the stress he has been going through, and the loss of his father as well. A person who admits and apologises is a far better person than one who covers things up.""
Another Facebook user May Lin said: ""Hadn't been easy for him since getting the gold. Hope he gets through this difficult phase safely. I wish him peace.""
Other commenters were more scathing about his drug use, pointing out that he should face the consequences of breaking the law and should even be held to a higher standard as a national athlete and public figure. 
""Quite disappointing. Expect more discipline from our national athlete,"" said Facebook user Joyce Lee.  
Another user, Sorensen Cartino Lim, said the confession did not lessen Schooling's ""grave mistake as a sportsman"".
The 27-year-old, who became Singapore’s first Olympic gold medallist after he edged out swim icon Michael Phelps at the 2016 Rio Olympics, apologised in a statement on Tuesday night. 
“I am sorry that my actions have caused hurt to everyone around me, especially to my family and the young fans who look up to me,"" he said. 
""I gave in to a moment of weakness after going through a very tough period of my life. I demonstrated bad judgment and I am sorry.
""I made a mistake and I’m responsible for what I’ve done. I will make amends and right what is wrong. I won’t let you down again.""
Schooling failed to qualify for the 100m butterfly semi-finals at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021. His father, Colin Schooling, died in November at the age of 73, after undergoing treatment for cancer in recent months.

Singapore swimmer Joseph Schooling confesses to consuming cannabis overseas: MINDEF













Sociologist with the National University of Singapore (NUS) Tan Ern Ser said many people in Singapore still think of Schooling as a “local boy achieving international fame” after he became the country’s first Olympic gold medallist. 
“This impression is in turn extended to how people view him as a person, who may make mistakes, arising especially from circumstances perceived as not within his control,” he added. 
Many also view Schooling as a hero due to his sporting achievements, said Assoc Prof Tan. 
“And especially since he has come across as humble and modest and therefore likeable, unlike some who act entitled and diva-like,” he added. 
Political analyst Eugene Tan, of the Singapore Management University's Yong Pung How School of Law, noted that some segments of the public empathise with Schooling and the challenging time he has had in the last few years. 
“To be clear, they do not condone his actions. I think there is a sense that we cannot be fair-weathered supporters. Sure, he has done wrong and set a bad example particular to the young athletes who look up to him as a role model. 
“There is also perhaps a recognition that his fall from grace reflects the challenges and demands of coping with his Olympic success.” 
Assoc Prof Eugene Tan was also the team manager of the national swim team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
Singapore's chef de mission for the 2016 Olympics Low Teo Ping said in an interview on CNA938 that he was ""a little bit disappointed"" about the decision to not let Schooling train during his NS.
""They should just let him continue and I think that would be a much more positive approach to teaching - if you can call it a lesson,"" he added.
SINGAPORE'S STANCE ON CANNABIS
Besides having his sporting privileges in NS revoked, Schooling will also be placed on supervised urine tests for six months.
All Singapore Armed Forces personnel who test positive will be charged and sentenced accordingly, said MINDEF.
According to the Central Narcotics Bureau, any citizen or permanent resident found to have consumed controlled drugs outside of Singapore will also be liable for the drug consumption offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act. 
Those convicted of drug consumption may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to S$20,000.

Minister for Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam said previously that Singapore needs to “hold the line” on its stance on cannabis use, after the United Nations removed cannabis from the most tightly controlled category of narcotic drugs in 2020. 
When asked to assess Singapore's drug situation at the time, Mr Shanmugam said: ""You can never win the fight. But we more or less have it under control."" 
The number of first-time drug abusers being picked up in Singapore has been on the rise, he noted. 
With East Asia and Southeast Asia being the second-largest market for meth, Mr Shanmugam said the situation is ""not pretty"". 
""We have managed to have it under control in Singapore, but you need to be constantly on the vigil, and there is a fight internationally as well,"" he added. 
""We need to put forward our position, persuade countries that it is in the public interest – their public interest as well as our interest – that we fight this together.""
Younger supporters could take on a more liberal attitude towards Schooling’s drug use, especially since some countries are liberalising the use of cannabis and normalising the recreational use of drugs, said NUS’ Assoc Prof Tan Ern Ser. 
Noting that people in Singapore are not indifferent towards recreational drug use, Assoc Prof Eugene Tan said the public may be indulgent towards elite athletes, and see that “behind the facade is a human person with human frailties like you and me”. 
“There may well be a less forgiving attitude towards recreational drug use among some people and this is also tied to his being seen as a sporting idol of sorts. So what he did in using controlled drugs is seen as setting a very poor example,” he added. 
However, there is a sense that Schooling’s achievements are not undone by his mistakes, said Assoc Prof Eugene Tan. 
“He has owned up and acknowledged that he has fallen short. I see the difference in response as reflecting a difference in the indulgence accorded to Schooling.”"
UOB joins local banks in raising interest rates for savings accounts,"UOB’s move comes on the heels of a similar announcement by OCBC this week amid a rising interest rate environment.

Singapore’s third-largest bank will raise rates on its UOB One account – a move that will help customers reduce the ""inflationary impact on their hard-earned savings"", it said. 
The UOB One account offers customers tiered interest rates that are stepped up as customers grow their account balance, while spending a minimum of S$500 on select credit and debit cards and conducting other transactions.
With the latest move, account holders will be able to earn a maximum rate of 3.6 per cent on balances above S$75,000 and up to S$100,000, while meeting the minimum card spend and crediting their salary to UOB. This is up from a 3 per cent promotional rate introduced this month.
Those who meet the minimum card spend and perform three GIRO transactions in a month will also see higher interest rates.
Interest earned on the first S$15,000 will be raised to 0.75 per cent per annum, from the current 0.5 per cent.
Interest earned on the next three tiers of S$15,000 will go up to 0.8 per cent, 0.85 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. There are no changes to interest rates under this category for balances above S$60,000.
There will also be no changes to interest payouts for those that meet the single criteria of spending the minimum sum on selected cards.

UOB said its customers can easily track card spending, as well as the number of GIRO transactions and salary credited through the bank’s app.
“The (app’s) tracker helps customers to optimise their banking transactions to earn more interest on their UOB One Account balances. We also serve our customers Insights card to alert them on how they can reach the next level and earn more interest,” said the bank’s head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan.
“We want to ensure that our customers are able to achieve the best possible interest rates that are available to them.”

UOB’s move comes on the heels of a similar announcement by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) this week.
OCBC on Tuesday said it would be raising the interest rates on its flagship 360 savings account from Thursday, allowing customers to earn interest of up to 4.05 per cent per annum on the first S$100,000 of their account balances.
Previously, account holders could earn a maximum of 2.38 per cent a year of interest on balances of up to S$75,000.
The bank also said it would reinstate a bonus interest category, which would allow customers to earn an additional 0.35 per cent a year of bonus interest for spending at least S$500 on their OCBC 365 credit card.
It had halted this bonus interest in 2020, given the prolonged low interest rate environment then and an uncertain environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“In a rising interest rate environment, we want to reward our OCBC 360 account customers for their savings and banking behaviours, and for doing more with us, to enable them to grow their wealth and savings,” said Ms Tan Siew Lee, the bank's head of wealth management in Singapore.
She added that the reinstatement of the bonus category also marked “a tighter integration” between the OCBC 360 Account and the OCBC 365 credit card. These are the bank’s flagship products, with one in four 360 account holders having a 365 credit card, according to Ms Tan.
DBS Bank, Singapore’s largest lender, has increased rates for its signature Multiplier account earlier this month, up to as much as 3.5 per cent on savings of up to S$100,000.
Like those offered by other local banks, the Multiplier account offers tiered interest rates based on customers’ account balances. Interest rates go up when customers conduct more transactions with the bank in eligible categories, such as crediting one’s salary to DBS, spending with the bank’s credit or debit cards, and investments."
‘Rigorous evaluation’ on F-35 continues as Singapore’s defence needs evolve: RSAF,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rsaf-f-35-fighter-jet-singapore-defence-australia-exercise-pitch-black-2911941,"DARWIN: The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will not be in a rush to complete its evaluation of the F-35 fighter jet as Singapore’s defence needs continue to evolve.
 
Major Zhang Jian Wei, who heads an RSAF office preparing for the delivery of the F-35s, said there was no deadline on when it should complete the evaluation process.
 
“There is none unfortunately because the needs of the next-generation SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) will continue to evolve, and we need to continuously evaluate the need for the next-gen capability to meet the defence needs of our country,” the 37-year-old said.
 
MAJ Zhang was speaking to reporters on Tuesday (Aug 30) at Exercise Pitch Black, an air combat exercise involving Singapore and 16 other nations being held in Darwin, Australia.

The United States Marine Corps’ F-35Bs are also taking part in the exercise, and the RSAF said it is getting valuable insights on how the stealthy warplanes could work together with the rest of the SAF’s warfighting systems.
The RSAF will buy an initial four F-35Bs - the variant that can take off from shorter runways and land vertically - for further testing before deciding if it will take up the option of acquiring another eight of these fifth-generation jets.
The four F-35Bs are expected to be delivered in 2026 to a base in continental US, where the RSAF will test their advanced capabilities and determine integration requirements.
The F-35 can avoid getting detected, carry advanced weapons and fuse information from different sensors to give the pilot a more holistic picture, making it a “very lethal platform” that can survive longer in hostile environments, MAJ Zhang said.

NOT COMMITTING TO VARIANT YET
MAJ Zhang called the F-35B’s short take-off and vertical landing feature a “key capability”, but said the RSAF is keeping all options on the table before committing to a variant.
“While our rigorous evaluation process has identified the F-35B as the most suitable replacement for the F-16s as of now, we will continue our rigorous evaluation and we will make further decisions when we are ready,” he said.

When asked if this meant the RSAF was open to buying the F-35A - a more conventional fighter that can fly farther without refuelling and carry more weapons - or the F-35C variant designed to land on carriers, MAJ Zhang said this would depend on the results of the evaluation.
“We cannot make any determination right now and we are not sure about how things will go in future,” he said.

For now, MAJ Zhang said his office has a series of “evaluation opportunities” lined up in the coming months and years. This could include participating in F-35 users-only conferences and study visits to F-35 facilities around the world.
His office comprises four other RSAF experts, each focusing on the operations, logistics, infrastructure and security requirements for its F-35 programme.
For instance, the operations person could look at how the F-35 would conduct a mission, while the security person studies how to safeguard the jet’s top-secret capabilities.

EXCLUSIVE ACCESS
In May, the team visited F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin’s production line in Texas to learn more about the jet’s capabilities and maintenance needs, and to interact with other user countries.
On another visit to the facility in July, the team attended a training session with experienced United States Air Force F-35 instructors, tried an F-35 simulator and sat in a powered-on F-35 to better understand its use in different operational and tactical scenarios.

MAJ Zhang said the “high-fidelity” simulators closely replicated the F-35’s actual capabilities, and that his experience in the simulator was not far from his observations of how the jet operated in real life.
“We also corroborate that with our interactions with other F-35 users as well as we see how it performs in exercises such as Exercise Pitch Black. Suffice to say, we are happy with the performance of the aircraft as of now,” he said.

United States Marine Corps F-35B pilot Captain Anneliese Satz told reporters on Monday that she had a “great experience” flying with the RSAF’s fighter jets and tanker during the exercise, calling them “very capable (and) competent”.
“It's always been a good opportunity in order to increase the amount of reps we get working together in the air-to-air arena, and also with aerial refuelling,” she said.

Captain Satz said the F-35’s capabilities make it “more competitive” in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, and that fifth-generation fighter jets are “definitely the future”.
“Just having the aircraft available to us has given us an edge overall in our capabilities, especially when working together with fourth-gen or even with other fifth-gen aircraft,” she added.

MAJ Zhang declined to elaborate when asked what the RSAF has learnt from specific F-35 user countries, although he acknowledged that some of them have flown the jets in operational missions.
“Unfortunately, we are not privy to some of this more classified information as to how other nations operate the F-35 in operations,” he said.
“However, we have only heard good reviews about the performance of the aircraft in operations, but we don't have any further information on that. What we know is it is a combat-proven platform, as it has been already used in many operations.”
The US had deployed its F-35As to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastern flank ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while Germany in March said it will buy the F-35s - said to be capable of carrying US nuclear weapons stored in Germany - to support NATO's concept of nuclear deterrence.

CONCERNS WITH F-35 PROGRAMME
MAJ Zhang also addressed questions about whether the RSAF had any concerns with the global F-35 programme - from the B variant’s relatively smaller weapons payload, to South Korea grounding its entire F-35A fleet in January after a malfunction forced one plane to land on its belly.
To the first point, he said each variant has its own “unique capabilities”, and that the RSAF will decide which platform to take up based on its ability to interoperate with Singapore’s defence ecosystem.
To the second point, he said the RSAF keeps a “close watch” on the F-35 programme as a whole. “We will ensure that we only induct the most capable platform and when it is ready,” he said.

With delivery of RSAF’s F-35s about four years away, MAJ Zhang said details on initial training for both its operational and logistics crew will be “fleshed out” in the coming years, amid “comprehensive discussions” with the US’ F-35 Joint Program Office.
“We discuss items such as the type of maintenance equipment we should procure ahead of time, and the type of training we should receive as we approach the delivery of our aircraft,” he said of the office, which leads the F-35 life cycle programme management for foreign users.
Singapore’s F-35 package will include a jet training system, spare and repair parts, support equipment, tools and test equipment, technical data and publications, personnel training and training equipment, as well as logistics support services.
The entire package, including the jets, their engines, electronic systems and weapons employment capability, is estimated to cost US$2.75 billion, according to a US government press release in January 2020 on its approval of the F-35 sale to Singapore.

COSTS ""CONSISTENTLY"" GOING DOWN
MAJ Zhang said the F-35’s unit and sustainment costs - the latter involving maintenance and flight costs - have “consistently” gone down as the programme matured over the years.
Reuters reported in July that the F-35A costs US$221 million when it came off the production line in 2007, before increasing buyers, production quantities and know-how helped the price fall to US$79 million.
Forbes reported in July last year that this latest unit cost compares favourably to the latest non-stealth Western fighters - like the Rafale, Typhoon and F-15EX - that cost between S$85 to S$100 million each.

In September 2021, the F-35 Joint Program Office awarded Lockheed Martin a sustainment contract committing the contractor to reduce the average cost per flight hour for all F-35 variants, from US$36,100 in 2020 to US$33,400 in 2023.
According to a June 2021 article by Janes, citing a former F-35 programme official, the cost of flying Lockheed Martin’s newer F-16s is somewhere between US$25,000 to US$30,000 per hour.
“(The F-35’s) current cost is actually better or comparable to current fourth-generation fighters,” MAJ Zhang said, echoing what Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen told Parliament in 2019.
“We will continue our evaluation efforts to ensure that we only induct the most capable and cost-effective capability to meet the defence needs of Singapore.”"
Former security officer fined over collision at Istana that injured MFA permanent secretary,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/istana-collision-bollards-mfa-perm-sec-injured-2911531,"SINGAPORE: A former auxiliary police officer was fined S$2,500 on Wednesday (Aug 31) after causing a vehicle collision at the Istana last year.
Tan Chee Kiat, 30, pleaded guilty to a single charge of causing grievous hurt through a negligent act. He was a Certis CISCO officer at the time of the incident.
The Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the time, Mr Chee Wee Kiong, and his driver Mr Abdul Latif Karim suffered fractures in the collision on Aug 23, 2021.
The court heard that the crash took place on Edinburgh Road, which is located within the grounds of the Istana. Tan was deployed at a security post along Edinburgh Road on the morning of the incident.
His job was to operate the control panel for the ground bollards, which are barriers used to block access to roads. When activated, they rise from the ground.
Mr Chee was the sole passenger in the car driven by Mr Abdul Latif and their vehicle had cleared security and was travelling along Edinburgh Road. At 9.15am, Tan raised the bollards without checking that the car had passed them.
The car was driving at 10 kmh at the time, according to court documents. Mr Abdul Latif noticed that the bollards were being raised but he was unable to stop the car in time and hit the bollards.
Both men were taken to the hospital for treatment.
Mr Chee suffered multiple fractures, a sternum fracture and a tooth fracture. He was admitted the same day and discharged two days later.
Mr Abdul Latif sustained a sternum fracture and left knee contusion. He was discharged a day after the incident.
Investigations showed that standard safety procedures required the person operating the bollards to conduct a visual inspection of the bollards when activating them.
""When he activated the bollards, (Tan) had failed to conduct such a visual inspection and assumed that the car had passed the bollards, thus resulting in the collision,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Pang Jaime.
OFFICER FIRED OVER INCIDENT
Mr Pang sought a fine of S$2,500, citing the victims' severe injuries and Tan's failure to discharge his responsibility properly.
Defence counsel Wee Qianliang informed the court that his client was fired as a result of the incident, and was currently unemployed. He asked for a lower fine of S$2,000.
He said that the position of the control panel was such that Tan's back would be facing the road where the cars travelled, and that Tan did not notice any cars when he activated the bollards.
Mr Wee added that Tan immediately offered help to the victims after the collision. He said Tan was remorseful for his actions and had written personal apology letters.
The collision happened during the official visit of United States Vice President Kamala Harris to Singapore. Ms Harris was hosted by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and had meetings at the Istana that day, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press statement on her visit.
Mr Chee retired in April, after serving 40 years in the public service and Singapore Armed Forces.
The penalty for causing grievous hurt through a negligent act that endangers human life or personal safety is up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
POFMA warning issued to Truth Warriors website administrator for false claims about COVID-19 vaccines,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pofma-conditional-warning-truth-warriors-website-covid-19-vaccines-2911781,"SINGAPORE: An administrator for the Truth Warriors website was given a 12-month conditional warning under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) for publishing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines.
The POFMA Office said on Wednesday (Aug 31) that the warning was issued to the 47-year-old woman in relation to “false claims misleading people into thinking that the COVID-19 vaccines are not effective"" in reducing transmission rates of the coronavirus.
The falsehoods ran counter to efforts to combat COVID-19, it added.
On Oct 24, 2021, a POFMA direction was issued to Truth Warriors to carry correction notices on its website to inform people of the falsehoods, the POFMA office said.
The correction direction involved posts on the website that contained falsehoods relating to the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and for promoting ivermectin to treat the coronavirus.

The Health Ministry said then that many of the materials published on the Truth Warriors website were from unverified and dubious sources, and that individuals who heed the advice on the website can endanger themselves and the people around them.
Ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections.
The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) ""strongly advised"" consumers against self-medicating with the drug, saying it is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA for use in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
During the investigations, the woman claimed to have checked the credentials of the original authors of the articles, but admitted that she cannot be certain whether the information published was true, said the POFMA Office.
It issued the conditional warning to the woman for the charges after considering the facts and circumstances of the case.
If she reoffends during this period, the woman can be prosecuted for the original crime. An offence under Section 7 of the POFMA carries a fine of up to S$50,000, an imprisonment term of up to five years, or both.
""Online falsehoods that sow public confusion affect lives and harm society,"" the POFMA Office said. ""The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these false statements.""

Sponsor Hugo Boss stands by Joseph Schooling as experts say it's not end of the line for his brand,"Noting some positive online reactions to news of the Olympic champion's drug use, branding specialists add that he can repair his image and bounce back from the incident.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/joseph-schooling-drug-use-sponsorships-brand-hugo-boss-support-2911716,"SINGAPORE: While Olympic champion Joseph Schooling’s confession to drug use might have tarnished his reputation, the 27-year-old Singaporean swimmer still has a chance to repair his image and bounce back, according to brand experts CNA spoke to.
One of his sponsors, Hugo Boss, has also affirmed that its partnership and support for Schooling remains ""strong and unwavered"" and that the company believes he will deliver on his promise to make amends.
Schooling has been the brand's ambassador since 2018.
""It's not the end of the line for him, from a branding perspective, because he has a lifetime value as the superhero from the little red dot that did what the Michael Phelps of this world achieved,"" said international communications expert Lars Voedisch on Wednesday (Aug 31), a day after news broke of Schooling's admission that he had taken cannabis in May.
“Everyone in Singapore remembers that photo of him as a young swimmer standing next to Michael Phelps and then later, he won the gold in the pool,"" Mr Voedisch added, referring to the American swimmer whom Schooling idolised and later defeated en route to his historic 2016 Olympic victory in the 100m butterfly.
""So it’s really an 'against all odds' kind of hero story that will always be in people’s hearts and that is what makes it valuable for brands.
“It doesn’t matter what happens to him, Joseph Schooling will always be Singapore’s first Olympic gold medallist and nobody can take that away,"" he added. 
Schooling and fellow national swimmer Amanda Lim had been investigated by the Central Narcotics Bureau for possible offences related to the consumption of cannabis.
He confessed to consuming the drug while he was on short-term disruption from full-time National Service (NS) to train and participate in the Southeast Asian Games.
Schooling also issued a public apology on Tuesday, shortly after statements issued by the Defence Ministry and Sport Singapore.
""I am sorry that my actions have caused hurt to everyone around me, especially to my family and the young fans who look up to me,"" he said.

                           hr 
                












While public sentiment on the news of Schooling's drug use has been mixed, Mr Voedisch noted that some comments online were neutral or even positive to a certain extent.
“The public saw that he came out and admitted to it, so it wasn’t like he was officially exposed,” he said. “They saw him taking the first step, which creates a new possible narrative of a phoenix rising from the ashes.”
Deloitte Southeast Asia's sports business group leader James Walton said that sponsors like Hugo Boss, which is an adult-oriented brand, might find it easier to continue commercial relations with Schooling compared to a more family-oriented sponsor like Milo.
Speaking in a radio interview with CNA938, Mr Walton noted that he had not observed any calls on social media for sponsors to cease working with Schooling.
""There hasn't really been an element of cancel culture about this. I think people recognise that people can make mistakes and that he has been transparent.""
Communications expert Steeve Cupaiolo said while apologising and admitting was a good first step, what is needed next is for Schooling to explain why he did it.
“Athletes are often held to higher standards than the rest of us and they have to be accountable to the public because they are often seen as national icons,” said Mr Cupaiolo, who is the chief executive officer of marketing agency Silk Road Sports Consulting. 
“It was brave for Joseph Schooling to admit it because it’s not easy to say that you made a mistake, especially when it’s so public.
“But to avoid a big crisis, he should also be as transparent as possible, and explain why he did it,” added Mr Cupiaolo.
WHAT NEXT FOR HIS SPONSORSHIPS?
Since shooting to fame in 2016 with his Olympic gold, several brands including Hugo Boss, Nestle and Yakult have placed their support behind Schooling.
But news of his confession to drug use has sparked discussion around whether brands should distance themselves from the athlete.
DBS bank told CNA that its partnership with Schooling ended last year before he enlisted for NS in January.
Responding to queries from CNA, Hugo Boss said its partnership and support for Schooling remains ""strong and unwavered"". 
""Joseph has made a mistake but what's important is that he has taken ownership of it,"" said the fashion house's Southeast Asia managing director Steven Lam. 
""Over the years, he has always been a positive influence in and out of the pool. He has inspired many kids to believe in themselves, to work hard and to chase their dreams.""
Mr Lam added: ""We have taught future generations that it’s ok to make mistakes, to own up, but you will have to take responsibility and more importantly, fix it.
""It will be a long road ahead for Joseph but we believe he will now show us how he will make good his promise to rebuild the trust with the people who believe in him.""
CNA has contacted other brands associated with Schooling.
The communications experts CNA spoke to said the fate of his current sponsorship deals would depend on the individual brands and their values. 
In some cases, brands may decide to terminate a contract with an athlete or a celebrity out of concern that their reputation might affect the company’s image, said Mr Voedisch, who is the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications.
“The companies have to decide what is the alignment they want, is it about certain values or access to the athlete or celebrity’s target audience,” he said.
“A company whose primary focus is on young children, for example, might be more sensitive to incidents like the one that happened with Joseph Schooling - compared to a beer company.""
But terminating a contract to save a company’s image might also end up backfiring.
“The company that drops partners at the first sign of thunder might also be seen as not sustainable or not really committed or even hypocrites because only the person who doesn’t make mistakes should cast the first stone,” said Mr Voedisch.
Experts highlighted that for some brands, the ongoing saga could even make Schooling more attractive as a partner, as it could render him more relatable and approachable to the public.
“Right now, he’s like a hot iron that no new brands would want to touch,” said Mr Voedisch. “But for the brands that he’s currently working with, what happened might actually increase his value because he becomes more human.
“Most heroes become more close to our hearts when we see them making mistakes and they are not those untouchable supergods,"" he added. ""They have flaws like you and me.""

The contribution will supplement the Singapore Red Cross' donation of S$50,000 to support the immediate needs of affected communities, including food, emergency shelter, water and sanitation solutions and hygiene items, said the ministry.
The Singapore Red Cross' contributions will support the humanitarian response by Red Cross Red Crescent partners on the ground, including the Pakistan Red Crescent Society and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, it said in a press release on Monday.
Singapore Red Cross added that it has launched a public fundraising appeal from Aug 29 to Nov 30 to support the relief and recovery operations.
The United Nations also appealed for US$160 million on Tuesday to help the South Asian nation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will head to Pakistan next week to see the effects of the ""unprecedented climate catastrophe"", a spokesperson said.
Mr Guterres said the funds he hoped to raise with the appeal would provide 5.2 million people with food, water, sanitation, emergency education and health support.

Jurong Bird Park: Key milestones of the iconic Singapore attraction ,"Jurong Bird Park, Asia's largest bird park, will close on Jan 3, 2023, ahead of its move to Mandai.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jurong-bird-park-milestones-mandai-wildlife-group-2909101,"SINGAPORE: Remember that school excursion or family trip to Jurong Bird Park?
Since opening in 1971, Asia's largest bird park has welcomed more than 40 million visitors. It is home to 3,500 birds across 400 species. 
More than 50 years on, the iconic attraction is preparing to close on Jan 3, 2023, ahead of its move to Mandai. 
Here's a look at the key milestones of Jurong Bird Park.
Opening of Jurong Bird Park
Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, Jurong Bird Park officially opened on Jan 3, 1971.
This was before the Singapore zoo opened in 1973.
The idea for a bird park came from the late Dr Goh Keng Swee, who was then Finance Minister, after he visited an aviary in Rio De Janeiro in 1968. He felt that having a bird park in Singapore would give Singaporeans an opportunity to connect with nature at a time of rapid urbanisation in the country.
""It was also famously reported that when asked why not build a zoo instead, Dr Goh said 'bird seeds cost less than meat',"" said Mandai Wildlife Group on Tuesday (Aug 30) when it announced Jurong Bird Park's closing date.
When the park opened in 1971, it had 78 display aviaries, a nursery breeding area as well as a tram system.
The centrepiece was the Jurong Falls Aviary, now known as Waterfall Aviary. It houses one of the world's tallest man-made indoor waterfalls, standing at 30m tall.

Royal visitor 
In 1972, Jurong Bird Park welcomed Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. They were in Singapore as part of their Southeast Asian and Indian Ocean tour.
In August that year, the bird park recorded its millionth visitor.

Launch of new bird shows
A master plan was launched in 1985 to upgrade Jurong Bird Park, to improve the living conditions of the birds and improve the visitor experience. 
New attractions were built such as the Pool's Amphitheatre, Flightless Birds exhibit and Panorail - a monorail system that offered panoramic views of the park. 
The Pool's Amphitheatre, which features the All Stars Bird Show, had a capacity of 2,000. When it opened in 1992, the amphitheatre had the largest canopy in the world. 
A crowd favourite has got to be the King of the Skies presentation, featuring birds like the Bald Eagle and Himalayan Griffon Vulture. The show was launched at the Fuji Hawk Centre - now known as Hawk Arena - when it opened in 1988.

Breeding of birds 
Jurong Bird Park contributes to conservation efforts. Its Breeding and Research Centre focuses on the propagation of threatened species and research on breeding biology. 
In 1992, it saw the world's first Black Hornbill bred under human care. Black Hornbills are a vulnerable species native to Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, said Mandai Wildlife Group.
Then in 2001, a Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise was bred under human care - a world first. This helped Jurong Bird Park clinch the Breeders' Award from the American Pheasant and Waterfowl Society.
In 2012, the park's Breeding and Research Centre was officially launched for public viewing, giving visitors an opportunity to learn about how the park's chicks are hatched from eggs.

Partnership with other wildlife groups
From 2018 to 2021, the park was involved in various partnerships with other wildlife groups. This ranged from rescuing birds and breeding them. 
The park also hatched the critically endangered Negros Bleeding-hearts two months after its arrival here. This marked the first conservation breeding programme outside of the bird's native country, the Philippines. The goal is to return the progenies back to help repopulate their native habitat, said Mandai Wildlife Group.
A pair of Philippine Eagles was also loaned to Singapore to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the Philippines in 2019.

New beginnings
Jurong Bird Park will move to a new home called Bird Paradise, joining the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, the Night Safari and an upcoming attraction called Rainforest Wild at Mandai Wildlife Reserve.
According to Mandai Wildlife Group, the new bird park is dedicated to bird conservation and will house ""one of the largest numbers of threatened avian species under human care""."

He told investigators that he did not approach authorities about his NS obligations each time he was in Singapore as he wanted to focus on his studies, according to court documents.
Tsai is the 19th man to be jailed since the sentencing framework for NS defaulters in 2017. 
Jurong Bird Park set to close on Jan 3, 2023 – time to plan a trip down memory lane
Jurong Bird Park will close on Jan 3, 2023, exactly 52 years after its opening in 1971. Staff and avian residents will then begin preparations to move to their new home at Mandai Wildlife Reserve.
From Sep 3, there will be activities lined up at the park to celebrate its legacy and rich heritage. At its entrance, a recreation of the old cuckoo clock tower doubles as a countdown timer to the park’s final day of operation.

CNA Explains: Repealing a law and amending the Singapore Constitution
The Government is set to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code and amend the Constitution of Singapore to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts. But what does it mean to repeal a law and amend the Constitution? What does the process entail, and how long will it take? 
Assistant Professor Benjamin Ong from the Yong Pung How School of Law at the Singapore Management University helped explain the process."
"NS defaulter jailed for staying overseas without permit, said he was focusing on studies","Tsai Yi-hsuan, who was born and grew up in Taiwan, remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit for almost four years and eight months in total.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-jailed-staying-overseas-without-permit-focusing-studies-2909356,"SINGAPORE: A Taiwan-born Singaporean was jailed for nine weeks on Tuesday (Aug 30) for defaulting on his National Service (NS) obligations.
Tsai Yi-hsuan, now 25, stayed outside Singapore for a total of almost four years and eight months without a valid exit permit.
He pleaded guilty to three charges under the Enlistment Act.
He told investigators that he did not approach authorities about his NS obligations each time he was in Singapore as he wanted to focus on his studies, according to court documents.
Tsai has since completed his full-time NS in the Singapore Armed Forces. He is the 19th man to be jailed since the High Court set out the sentencing framework for NS defaulters in 2017.
BORN AND RAISED IN TAIWAN
The court heard that Tsai was born in Taiwan in 1997. His mother and sister are Singaporeans, while his father is a former permanent resident. 
Tsai grew up and was educated in Taiwan, according to Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicolle Ng.
He has held four Singapore passports, which he used to travel in and out of the country on 12 occasions. He would travel to Singapore to visit his maternal relatives.
Tsai had known that he held Singapore citizenship since elementary school. From the age of 16, he had also known that he was required to serve NS in Singapore as his mother told him so.
After Tsai turned 16-and-a-half in 2013, he received an NS registration notice at an old address in Taiwan that was owned by his parents.
Tsai's family was not living at that address, but arranged for a security guard to collect their letters there and retrieved the letters on a monthly basis.
Tsai's father handed the NS registration notice to Tsai after collecting it.
REGISTERED FOR NS
In May 2014, Tsai went to Singapore to register for NS and collect his identity card. He also updated his family's address in Taiwan with the Central Manpower Base (CMPB).
Tsai was then found to have remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit on several occasions from 2010, when he turned 13, to 2014.
Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singaporeans and permanent citizens aged 13 and above must comply with exit permit requirements.
When Tsai went to register for NS on Jun 3, 2014, the counter staff at CMPB reminded him to get a valid exit permit to stay outside Singapore.
CMPB also acknowledged Tsai's application to defer NS for overseas studies and requested further documents to process this.
But two days later, Tsai left for Taiwan without a valid exit permit.
APPLIED TO DEFER NS
Later that month, Tsai's mother submitted supporting documents for her son's NS deferment.
CMPB replied asking for more documents, including further proof from Tsai's school on his studies, and proof of overseas employment or business registration for Tsai's parents.
When there was no response from Tsai's mother, CMPB emailed her again about a month later to no avail. It followed up with a letter to Tsai's updated address in Taiwan.
Tsai confirmed that he and his family stayed at the address at the time. But as he was preparing for university entrance exams and his studies took priority, he did not ask his mother about his NS obligations.
He next went to Singapore in September 2014 to attend his grandfather's funeral, returning to Taiwan after five days.
On Oct 2, 2014, CMPB sent a letter to Tsai's old address in Taiwan stating that his application for NS deferment could not be considered.
The letter also enclosed an order instructing Tsai to report to CMPB for his medical screening the next month, failing which he would become an NS defaulter.
Tsai did not report for his medical screening in Singapore.
On Feb 12, 2015, Tsai turned 18. He knew that he would be required to fulfil NS obligations upon reaching his enlistment age.
But he did not follow up with his mother, who was helping with his NS deferment, as he was studying, said Ms Ng.
Tsai remained overseas for the next few years, only coming to Singapore in April 2018 to perform rites at his grandmother's tomb. He returned to Taiwan about a week later.
RETAINED SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP
In October 2018, Tsai took the Oath of the Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty to retain his Singapore citizenship.
Tsai wanted Singaporean citizenship as he thought that housing and good jobs were difficult to find in Taiwan. He felt that he could have a bright future and start a family in Singapore, said Ms Ng.
But when Tsai was unable to renew his Singapore passport after that, his mother contacted the NS Call Centre.
In January 2019, an enlistment inspector informed Tsai's mother that her son had committed offences under the Enlistment Act and was to report to CMPB in Singapore.
Tsai came to Singapore on Feb 7, 2019 and surrendered at CMPB the next day.
CONNECTION TO SINGAPORE
The prosecution sought the jail term imposed on Tsai, arguing that the objective was to preserve the core principles of national security, universality and equity affecting NS.
""The fact (that Tsai) had comparatively limited substantial connection to Singapore, by virtue of growing up and being educated in Taiwan, is not relevant to sentencing,"" said Ms Ng.
On the contrary, Tsai was ""clearly aware of and identified with his Singapore citizenship"", she argued, pointing to his preference for Singapore citizenship in view of the life he could build.
The mitigating factors were Tsai's voluntary surrender and plea of guilt, added the prosecutor.
The Ministry of Defence previously said that it takes a firm stand against offenders, in response to past cases involving NS defaulters.
""If we allow Singapore citizens or permanent residents who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined,"" said the ministry.
The penalty for remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both."
Some mask manufacturers in Singapore scale back production as restrictions ease,"Some manufacturers who started making masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic foresaw that demand would dip after outdoor mask restrictions were lifted, and made plans to scale down production. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/surgical-n95-mask-suppliers-shopee-lazada-mask-restrictions-indoors-2908991,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore eases mask restrictions, mask manufacturers are scaling back production or pivoting to corporate clients.
There used to be manufacturers in Singapore that produced surgical masks but this stopped more than 10 years ago. Many of the manufacturers CNA spoke to started making them because of a global face mask shortage at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
From Monday, Singapore lifted restrictions on wearing masks indoors, except on public transport and in healthcare settings. The requirement to wear masks outdoors was lifted on Mar 29.

Wearing a mask to be optional from Aug 29, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities



















Many people still masked up in shopping malls on first day of eased restrictions 













Technology company Razer told CNA it will be slowing down its face mask production following the easing of mask restrictions. 
Razer said it started making masks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the global shortage, and ""converted existing product manufacturing lines to make and donate face masks for immediate relief"". The company also started Singapore’s first fully automated mask production and packing line. 
SCALING BACK PRODUCTION
Some companies had already scaled back production when mask requirements outdoors were lifted earlier this year. 
Director of AVS Technologies Kelvin Mun told CNA that the company already stopped production of face masks earlier this year, and fully shut down its mask manufacturing line in June.
Everything lined up, he said, adding that the company’s raw materials for mask manufacturing were used up at around the same time it was due to renew its mask manufacturing licence with the Health Sciences Authority. 
The company, which sells printing equipment, set up its mask manufacturing line in March 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic because it could not buy enough masks for its own use. 
“We saw that there was a short supply and everyone was panicking and they needed the masks. We thought that we could fill the gap to help supply the shortage,” Mr Mun said. 
“It was a totally different thing (from our original business). It was difficult for us because we had to learn the new lingo from the medical side, all the requirements and paperwork that we were not used to.” 
AVS Technologies said it sold its masks online and in army supplies shops, selling more than S$100,000 worth of masks per month at the peak of its production.
The company has managed to sell off most of its stock, with just a few cartons of kids masks remaining. It plans to donate the masks or share the masks with staff who have children. 
Managing director of 3P Medical Device Joseph Ong also said his company had scaled back production by about 40 per cent over the past six months. The company started producing masks in the first quarter of 2020, on top of Mr Ong’s other businesses.
The company used to produce about 300,000 to 400,000 masks per month, and produces about 200,000 now. It currently has no plans to scale operations down further, as 40 per cent of its customer base is still made up of corporate customers.
It also sells its masks with traditional Chinese medicine shops, hospital pharmacies, mom-and-pop stores, as well as online resellers like Shopee and Lazada. 
“That was probably (because we were) anticipating when masks are no longer needed outdoors, there would come one day that the Government might announce that masks are no longer needed indoors,” he told CNA.
“But generally, after two-and-a-half years, the public has two sides, or preferences. One side, they prefer not to wear. The other side, they will still continue to wear,” he said, adding that many people still do not feel comfortable going around without a mask.
Singapore Technologies Engineering, or ST Engineering began domestic production of medical-grade surgical masks in mid-February 2020, and the masks were used in Singapore’s hospitals on the frontline against COVID-19. 
At the time, Singapore had to restart its domestic production capabilities when one of its foreign suppliers could not fulfill its contractual obligations recently to produce surgical masks, then-Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said. 
“Our medical-grade surgical mask business was set up with a clear objective, that is to help Singapore establish local mask manufacturing capabilities and strengthen mask supply chain resilience,” said ST Engineering. 
In response to queries about whether the company would be stepping down mask production, ST Engineering said: “Our focus has always been on building a sustainable supply of medical-grade surgical masks and N95 masks for our healthcare and frontline workers, as well as local communities in need, and will remain so going forward. 
“We have resilient capacity utilisation and business models which well address demand pattern changes.” 
Meanwhile, Vital Shield told CNA it plans to maintain mask production or even scale up production if it secures more corporate clients.
The company started manufacturing masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, adjacent to another cleaning company run by the team.
The manufacturer initially saw demand for masks drop by about 10 per cent when the outdoor restrictions were first relaxed. But demand gradually clawed back as Singapore saw infection waves from different variants of COVID-19 and monkeypox, said its sales and marketing manager Mellissa Hau. 
The company sells its masks on its website as well as on Shopee and Lazada. But since corporate orders make up about 65 per cent of its demand, the team plans to continue its current level of production. Many of its corporate clients are from industries that still require employees to wear masks, like in F&B or hospitality, said Ms Hau. 
“We felt that masks were very expensive and their quality was not there. So we decided to do our own,” she added.
“The first year, business was good because that was the start, and people were trying to find affordable and quality masks. After about one-and-a-half years, more competition came in, especially from overseas where the cost was very low … so we got affected a little.”
This year, several players decided to shut down operations and focus on their other business, said Ms Hau. 
“So the pie is bigger. Our share of the pie increases because some of the players have withdrawn from this industry.”

MONITORING CONSUMER DEMAND
FairPrice Group, which runs NTUC FairPrice supermarkets, Cheers outlets and Unity pharmacies, said it was currently too early to comment on mask sales, since the eased restrictions were only recently announced. 
“We will continue to monitor consumer demand and adjust our supply accordingly.” 
Pharmacy chain Watsons said it had already “redone” its forecasting for stocks of face masks since wearing a mask was made optional at the end of March this year.
“Currently, we hold an optimal level of stock; enough for current demand while we continue to monitor onward demand with the new rules soon to take place,” said the pharmacy. 
Dairy Farm Group, which runs the Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets as well as Guardian outlets, declined to comment on its plans for its current stock of masks."
"Singapore's first arts university, formed by NAFA and LASALLE alliance, to welcome students from 2024","The University of the Arts Singapore will award degrees offered by both institutions.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-arts-university-lasalle-nafa-moe-arts-degree-2909291,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s first government-supported private arts university will welcome its inaugural cohort of students in August 2024.
The University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) is being formed by an alliance between the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and the LASALLE College of the Arts.
Applications will open in the third quarter of 2023, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Tuesday (Aug 30).
The setting up of the university was first announced in 2021 by then-Education Minister Lawrence Wong at the Committee of Supply debates.
UAS will validate, confer and award degrees offered by NAFA and LASALLE, as well as provide “some centralised services” to both schools, said the Education Ministry in a press release.
The university will offer an expanded range of programmes in fine arts, design, media arts, performing arts and arts management, as well as in new and upcoming areas in the applied arts, said MOE.
The slate of offerings for the 2024 academic year as well as the tuition fees will be announced later. There will not be a new campus for the new university, MOE confirmed in a briefing on Tuesday. 
“Students can look forward to a common UAS student experience which builds on their LASALLE and NAFA experiences, more learning opportunities through a wider range of cross-college modules, joint electives, enhanced student support services, and new access to shared resources and facilities,” said MOE.
Currently, LASALLE and NAFA award degrees in partnership with well-known overseas universities such as Goldsmiths and the Royal College of Music and the University of Arts London, and these programmes are subsidised by MOE.
Under the alliance, LASALLE will award students with a degree from the University of the Arts Singapore from its 2024 intake, instead of one in Goldsmiths’ name. 
For NAFA, the final intake of students under the degree programmes validated by the University of Arts London and Royal College of Music will be admitted in the 2025 academic year. 
NAFA also plans to announce new degree programmes under the UAS name closer to 2024. 
The name of the new university was jointly decided on by NAFA and LASALLE after “extensive consultations” with stakeholders including staff, alumni and students.
LASALLE and NAFA each have about 2,500 students currently enrolled, across degree and diploma programmes. 
DIVERSE PATHWAYS FOR THE FUTURE ECONOMY
Singapore’s future economy will need talent beyond the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, disciplines including those from the arts and humanities, said MOE at the briefing on Tuesday. 
The Education Ministry also recognises that there are pathways for people in Singapore with different aptitudes, and having diverse pathways is important, it added. The ministry also said that the employment outcomes of graduates from the arts institutions are strong.
From Sep 1, 2022, the UAS board of trustees will be led by Mr Jose Isidro Camacho. The board has appointed Professor Kwok Kian Woon as the university’s first vice-chancellor and chief executive.
Mr Camacho is the managing director and vice chairman of Credit Suisse Asia Pacific, based in Singapore, and was conferred the Public Service Medal in 2021 for his service to the National Gallery and the promotion of arts in Singapore.
He and his wife are avid art collectors who have accumulated one of the most important private art collections in Asia, said the Education Ministry in the press release.
Prof Kwok is currently associate vice president for well-being at Nanyang Technological University and has previously served in various capacities on the National Arts Council and National Heritage Board.
“The UAS can be a very special institution of higher learning, transforming arts education and energising our cultural landscape and the creative economy,” said Prof Kwok. 
“Our artists, who are also educators at the same time, have much to offer to our next generations of artists and creative citizens.”"
Changi Airport and Jetstar in discussions over move to Terminal 4: Iswaran,"Changi Airport’s Terminal 4 will reopen on Sep 13, with 16 airlines expected to relocate to the terminal in September and October. Jetstar had earlier expressed refusal to move. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-airport-jetstar-t4-terminal-4-move-2908876,"SINGAPORE: Changi Airport Group (CAG) and Jetstar Group are in discussions to ensure the airline’s operations remain effective and the needs of the passengers are met, following the latter’s refusal to move to Terminal 4, said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Tuesday (Aug 30). 
“It is important to do this well rather than do it fast,"" said Mr Iswaran during a media tour of the terminal. 
""If it means taking a little bit more time, but making sure that all the key elements are taken care of well, to the reasonable satisfaction of all the parties involved, then I think that should be our priority. And I think that's the basis on which both parties are working together.”
CAG announced in July that Jetstar Group is slated to move to Terminal 4 on Oct 25 after the terminal reopens on Sep 13 following a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But Jetstar said it had ""no intention of moving"". 
The company said the decision to move was made unilaterally by CAG, disregarding the “impact a move would have on our customers, our people, and our operations”.  
Ensuring that passengers' needs are met and that Jetstar can function effectively is “not just Jetstar’s objective, it's also CAG’s objective”, Mr Iswaran said on Tuesday.
Responding to queries about the ongoing discussions, a Jetstar spokesperson told CNA on Wednesday that a joint study is under way and an update will be provided ""in due course"".

FLIGHTS COMMENCING OPERATIONS ON SEP 13 
When Terminal 4 reopens, 16 airlines will relocate to the terminal in stages in September and October. 
Cathay Pacific and Korean Air will move to Terminal 4 on reopening day. The first flight to arrive at the terminal on Sep 13 will be a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong at 3.05pm, while the first departure flight will be a Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong at 6pm on the same day. 
AirAsia Group will commence operations on Sep 15, while Cebu Pacific, Juneyao Air, Jeju Air, Bamboo Airways and HK Express will follow suit on Sep 20.
Other airlines such as Vietnam Airlines, VietJet Air and Thai VietJet Air will move from other terminals two days later on Sep 22.
The reopening of Terminal 4 will ensure that the air hub can meet the increasing demand for travel as the year-end peak approaches, said CAG in its news release. 
“It's been about five months since we reopened our borders to vaccinated travellers. And in that time, we have now seen our passenger volumes rise to a weekly average of about 58 per cent of what it was pre-COVID. And that is in 2019,” said Mr Iswaran. 
“In terms of flights, (it) is actually more around 64 per cent. And importantly, when we look ahead to the winter period … around the peak seasons of November, December, January, the flights are likely to increase to about 80 per cent of pre-COVID levels.” 
To meet the year-end increased traveller demand, the aviation industry also plans to recruit another 3,500 to 4,000 employees, added Mr Iswaran.

3D SCREENING, RETAIL AND DINING OPTIONS
The terminal will have automated processes for travellers from check-in to boarding, as it did before operations were suspended in May 2020 due to the pandemic. 
The use of technology extends to security checks, which will use 3D screening technology that allows passengers to keep laptops and tablets in their bags during the screening process.
There will also be a 70m-wide “immersive digital wall” spanning the entire length of the security screening area, with scenes of travel destinations.

Aside from duty-free shopping in the transit and arrival areas, several retail and dining outlets will open on Sep 13, with more shops opening progressively in the coming months. 
The outlets starting operations on opening day include the International Food Hall, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and WHSmith in the transit area, as well as Andes by Aston in the public area of the terminal. 
Visitors will also get to enjoy attractions like the Heritage Zone, art pieces and the “Steel in Bloom” garden. 
Chandelier, a 16m-high play structure made from red climbing ropes, will also reopen. A tubular slide has also been added to the play area, so that passengers can slide down from the departure transit area to the playground instead of taking the lift."
"RSAF takes part in 17-nation air combat exercise in Australia, gets ‘valuable insights’ on F-35 fighter jet","Singapore is among a bumper crop of countries taking part in Exercise Pitch Black in Darwin.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mindef-rsaf-f35-fighter-jet-australia-exercise-pitch-black-darwin-2909146,"SINGAPORE: The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is learning more about its upcoming F-35 fighter jets while it participates in a multilateral air combat exercise in Australia.
Singapore is part of a bumper crop of 17 countries - including Australia, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, India and Japan - taking part in Exercise Pitch Black, a biennial event being held in Darwin from Aug 19 to Sep 8.
This year’s exercise involves up to 2,500 personnel and 100 aircraft from participating nations “pitting their air combat skills against simulated threats in a challenging and realistic training environment”, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said in a media release on Tuesday (Aug 30).
The previous exercise in 2018 had nine nations training across a smaller area, while the 2020 edition was cancelled due to COVID-19.

RSAF to fly F-16 fighter jets for 'at least' another decade, following F-35 developments 'closely': Air force chief













This year’s training area is 240 nautical miles wide and 300 nautical miles long, at least 20 times larger than RSAF’s usual training area in the South China Sea. The bigger space allows for more realistic and complex scenarios.
The RSAF has deployed 400 personnel, eight F-15SG and eight more F-16D+ fighter aircraft, one Gulfstream 550 airborne early warning aircraft, as well as one A330 multi-role tanker transport taking part for the first time.
This makes RSAF one of the largest participants in terms of manpower and assets, MINDEF said.
RSAF’s exercise director Colonel (COL) Mark Tan, 44, told reporters in a video call from Darwin that the larger number of participants means an increase in aircraft numbers and type, making the exercise more comprehensive and challenging.
“Your ability to integrate and operate becomes a little bit more difficult. So, the considerations and the execution become that much more complex,” he said.

For instance, COL Tan highlighted that the MRTT will be able to do aerial refuelling with fighter jets from other countries.
“That means they are able to develop their ... interoperability a little bit more and their (aerial refuelling) capability as a whole much broader than we would as compared to just being limited to RSAF fighters,” he said.
















SIZING UP THE F-35
The RSAF has also trained alongside the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and US Marine Corps F-35s at the exercise, which features these fifth-generation fighter jets for the first time.
Singapore has agreed to buy four F-35Bs - the short take-off and vertical landing variant - with the possibility of another eight. Delivery is expected by 2026.
“This has offered us valuable insights into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters’ advanced capabilities and how they can be integrated into the Singapore Armed Forces’ warfighting systems to enhance our operational edge,” COL Tan said.
Chief of Air Force Major-General Kelvin Khong said in February that the RSAF has been following F-35 developments ""closely"", amid a string of crashes involving the roughly US$100 million plane.

There is a hardly a better opportunity to get closer to the F-35 than to engage it in an aerial mission, and that is what RSAF F-15SG pilot Major (MAJ) Arumugam Sivaraj did at Exercise Pitch Black.
MAJ Sivaraj, 36, had flown his jet as an “enemy” against RAAF F-35s in a “very challenging scenario”, and said his opponents handled it “very well”.
“Through this we can actually see how capable the F-35s are in their teamwork. The way the aircraft flies, how they target the adversaries and how they work together as a team was quite impressive to see,” he said.
COL Tan said the F-35s flew against a dedicated opposing team with up to two times more jets, but were still able to “effectively target and terminate all enemies”.

MAJ Sivaraj said he is looking forward to the next stage of the exercise involving more assets participating simultaneously, and seeing how his fourth-generation jet can integrate with the F-35.
“But from how we have seen the F-35s fly, they're really capable aircraft. They bring a significant advantage in the mission and they are a key enabler to some of the missions that we are going to be doing in this exercise,” he said.
“It was quite exciting to fly together with them on the same side, and also against them to understand how they're fighting and their capabilities.”
The RSAF fighter jets, however, will not be showing off their firepower. COL Tan confirmed that they will not use their weapons - be they live or inert - due to “local constraints”.
“When we go overseas, we always drop ordnance - inert, live, general-purpose bombs to laser-guided weapons to precision weapons. So, we try to exercise the full range of weapons we have available to us,” he said.
“So while we have put a request to employ weapons in this year’s exercise, we are unable to do so.”

BENCHMARKING THE RSAF
MAJ Sivaraj also acknowledged the challenges that come with such a big multilateral exercise, pointing to issues like language barriers as well as differences in capabilities and tactics.
“Looking at the number of aircraft there are in this exercise is to find a common ground and how to best employ each aircraft to achieve the same objective in every mission,” he said.
“As we have flown for this week, I think a lot of the teething issues have been ironed out ... Now we can focus on tactics, force integration, how to work together as a team together with different types of aircraft within different nations in order to achieve mission objectives.”
MINDEF said RSAF personnel had the chance to build “strong bonds” as well as share best practices and operational ideas with their foreign counterparts.

When asked how working with the foreign F-35s could help RSAF integrate the jet into its warfighting concepts for future conflicts, COL Tan said it would be too early to say.
“Exercises like this just help us understand these aircraft in a large-force scenario, and that kind of knowledge will help us form and shape some (operational concepts) that we think we can employ subsequently,” he said.
“Until we receive the aircraft and really operate it on our own, I think it will be premature right now to say how ... the aircraft will be employed or how it will fit the overall (command) employment of its air combat capabilities.”
Ultimately, the exercise will allow the RSAF to test itself against other air forces, said Captain Clarence Ng, an F-16D+ weapon systems officer attending Exercise Pitch Black for the second time.

“It allows us to benchmark ourselves further with more countries around the region, to see where we actually stand in the region and to maintain our operational readiness,” the 30-year-old said.
Exercise Pitch Black was established in 1981. The RSAF first took part in the 1990 edition, when it became the first air force in the region to join the United States Air Force and RAAF in the exercise."
"New work pass for high earners, achievers can draw top talent in their fields to Singapore: HR experts","The new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass, which was announced by the Manpower Ministry on Aug 29, aims to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/talent-employment-pass-singapore-tech-foreign-workers-2909046,"SINGAPORE: The new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass for leaders in their fields can help pull top talent in specialised areas to Singapore, said experts.
This comes after the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Monday (Aug 29) announced the new work pass, which will also allow high-earners and high-achievers to live in Singapore without having to secure a job here first.
Mr Nilay Khandelwal, managing director of recruitment agency Michael Page Singapore, said that the talent crunch here is especially tight at senior levels, and the new employment pass is likely targeted at attracting specific talent in niche areas.
“If you're investing into Singapore as a market, if you're a start-up or one of the top organisations, it's quite a straightforward mechanism for you to get one of the people in your headquarters to be based here or one of the co-founders or founders from one of the markets to move into this market,” he said.
He said that this will greatly improve the ease of doing business here, adding: “It's basically trying to attract individuals from various walks of life who are at the top of their game, and truly making sure that Singapore becomes a global hub for talent.”
The bar is high for the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass. Applicants need to meet a salary threshold of S$30,000 a month or have “outstanding achievements” in their field, which can be in arts and culture, sciences, academia or sports.
Overseas candidates need to demonstrate that they are playing a leading role in an established company, with market capitalisation of at least US$500 million or annual revenue of USS$200 million.
But the pass offers much greater flexibility than existing work passes. As it’s not tied to a job here, the individual can concurrently start, operate and work for multiple companies in Singapore.
It also has a longer duration of five years and the person can sponsor his or her dependents to live here. Their spouses can work on a letter of consent.

Singapore to launch new work pass for top talent in all sectors from 2023













Announcing the new pass and changes to the employment pass framework on Monday, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said: “We are now in an era where businesses follow talent, as much as talent follows business. Both businesses and talent are searching for safe and stable environments to invest, live and work in. Singapore is such a place.”
Besides the new work pass, MOM will extend to five years the duration of work passes for experienced tech professionals with skills in shortage, from Sep 1, 2023.
At the same time, MOM said it will enable companies to be more responsive to business needs by shortening the processing time for EPs, and halving the Fair Consideration Framework job advertising duration from 28 days to 14 days.
GLOBAL COMPETITION FOR TALENT
Both Dr Tan and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said that other countries are also trying to attract their share of global talent, and Singapore cannot afford to fall behind.
Other countries have offered similar or better terms to talent looking to relocate. For example, the United Arab Emirates has a Golden Visa scheme for talent in medicine, science & technology, and culture and art that lasts for five to 10 years. The United Kingdom has a Global Talent Visa with a five-year duration.
Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of Permanent Recruitment in Asia Pacific at Randstad, said that every country in the world is trying to attract the same pool of talent, especially those who have the experience to “lead and drive change in a highly competitive and volatile market”.

“The Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass definitely comes across as a differentiated work pass that offers more flexibility and options to expatriates who are looking for an opportunity to work and live in Singapore long-term,” she said.
“The announcement sends a message that Singapore is deeply committed to retaining its place as the global talent hub in ASEAN as well as now, on a global level.”
In a statement on Monday, the British Chamber of Commerce affirmed this, saying that the focus on removing barriers for the highest levels of talent, combined with the longer-term approach to top-tier work passes, is a “clear signal to the industry of Singapore’s confidence as a contender for global and regional talent hubs”.
SECTORS THAT WILL BENEFIT
Ms Dass thinks that any sector that is undergoing significant change management, or is driving digital and green transformation would require “experienced interim leaders”. 
“These roles tend to be transient in nature as their skills and experiences are often most useful at different phases of change,” said Ms Dass.
“The industries that will get the opportunity to tap into this talent pool would include banking and financial services, fintech, technology, manufacturing, life sciences, just to name a few.”
The move is forward-looking in that it “paves the way for future workforce planning”.
She added that there are some parts of the business environment like green transformation and sustainability that will continue to need foreign talent to close the knowledge gap.
However, it may not necessarily alleviate Singapore’s current middle-level workforce crunch. 





The changes to the work pass framework will give startups and tech firms a leg up, said Ms Florence Neo, CEO of Action Community for Entrepreneurship, the national trade association for start-ups.
Talent acquisition and retention has been a key issue and growing concern in the startup ecosystem as start-ups are usually unable to compete with the bigger players and MNCs for talent. 
“We are pleased to hear that there is now an improved processing time for all EP applications, as well as a longer EP duration of five years for experienced tech professionals,” she said. 
“Talent is key to our startups’ growth. For each start-up to be able to attract and retain the talent it requires could well be a game changer to boost and future-proof our startup ecosystem.”
She added that foreign talent coming here also have to integrate with the existing talent pool of Singaporeans.
“It is not a binary choice. Both sides can learn and benefit from the other,"" she said.
“In the long run, more quality jobs and opportunities will be created in the market for locals.”
SAFEGUARDS FOR LOCAL WORKERS
But some warned that there should be ways to measure the returns of attracting top talent to Singapore.
“Will they eventually root themselves and families here, create jobs, impart skills? Or just spend some years here and eventually pack up and move home?” said Ms Angela Kuek, director at Meyer Consulting. 
“I’ve questions about that but only time will tell.”

National Trades Union Congress Assistant Secretary-General Patrick Tay said that there should be safeguards to let Singaporeans have fair opportunities to jobs; level the playing field for local professionals, managers and executives, and keep the “Singaporean Core intact and strong”.
 
He acknowledged that top talent in deep tech and specialised science/research roles can help groom and nurture local talent in these fields.
But he also asked for better clarity on the definition of top talent and for measures to ensure that there is knowledge sharing from foreign professionals to Singaporeans.
 
“I trust the Government will provide clear guidance on the definition of top talents, perhaps disclosing a list of reputable companies that employs top talents and roles can be shared externally for added accountability,” he said. 
“Careful consideration must be given to ensure that foreign top talents complement and plug the skills gaps for Singaporeans,"" he added.
But the reality is that Singapore is facing a shortage of local talents in certain sectors, and it needs to explore ways to grow the local talent pool to compete on an international stage, he said."
CNA Explains: Repealing a law and amending the Singapore Constitution,"The Government will repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code and amend the Constitution of Singapore to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts. What does this process entail? And how long will it take?
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/section-377a-repeal-laws-amendments-constitution-cna-explains-2906951,"SINGAPORE: The Government is set to repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code and amend the Constitution of Singapore to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts.
Section 377A criminalises sex between men. Section 12 of the Women's Charter defines marriage as being between a man and a woman; same-sex marriages are void.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made the announcement during the National Day Rally speech on Aug 21. But what does it mean to repeal a law and amend the Constitution? What does the process entail, and how long will it take? 
CNA spoke to Assistant Professor Benjamin Ong from the Yong Pung How School of Law at the Singapore Management University to find out more.
How is a law repealed?
An ordinary Act of Parliament – or part of an Act of Parliament, such as Section 377A of the Penal Code – can be repealed by another Act of Parliament, explained Asst Prof Ong.
The first parliamentary step in repealing a law is the introduction of a Bill to that effect. Bills are draft laws that become Acts of Parliament after they are passed by Parliament and assented to by the President.
“Like all Acts, the repealing Act must be passed by a simple majority – that is, more than half – of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are present and voting at a session of Parliament,” said Asst Prof Ong, adding that this number does not need to be half the total number of MPs.
“It will then be sent to the Presidential Council for Minority Rights, whose duty is to call attention to any provision that may have a discriminatory effect on racial or religious minorities.”
If there is no such discriminatory effect, then the Bill will be sent to the President for his or her formal assent.
How is the Constitution amended?
The Constitution of Singapore is the supreme law of the land. It sets out the country’s political framework and also contains provisions relating to fundamental liberties, citizenship and public service.
The Constitution can be amended through an Act of Parliament, but in terms of the number of votes required, the threshold for constitutional amendments is higher than that needed for the repeal of a law.
“An Act to amend the Constitution must be passed by at least two-thirds of the total number of MPs, excluding NMPs (Nominated Members of Parliament),” said Asst Prof Ong.
“Note that it’s two-thirds of the total number of MPs, excluding NMPs, not just two-thirds of the number of MPs who are present and voting at a session of Parliament.”
NMPs cannot vote on amendments to the Constitution.
This means that at least 63 votes from the 92 elected MPs and two Non-Constituency MPs would be required to amend the Constitution. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has 83 MPs.
When was the last time a law was repealed?
Termination of laws or sections of the law is a regular part of the parliamentary process.
“There is nothing really special about repealing laws. Enacting, amending and repealing Acts of Parliament are part and parcel of Parliament’s regular business,” said Asst Prof Ong.
“Just last month, Parliament passed an Act that repealed certain parts of the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 2006 and replaced them with new provisions, so as to enhance Singapore’s law on the trade in endangered species.
“In May, Parliament passed an Act to repeal the Adoption of Children Act and replace it with a new, overhauled version.”
When was the last time the Constitution was amended?
Similarly, debating and voting on constitutional amendments are part of an MP’s regular work.
“The Constitution was last amended earlier this month following the creation of the Singapore Armed Forces’ Digital and Intelligence Service,” said Asst Prof Ong.
“The amendment was to give the President the power to veto an appointment of the Chief of the Digital and Intelligence Service, just as the President has the power to veto appointments of the Chiefs of the Air Force, Army and Navy.”
Prior to that, the Constitution was amended in May to raise the fine quantum for the disqualification of MPs.

‘Not possible’ to keep status quo on Section 377A given vulnerability to legal challenges: Edwin Tong













Who is the party whip, and what is their role?
The party whip is described by the Singapore Parliament website as the disciplinarian of a political party.
The whip ensures that there are sufficient party members in the chamber to support the party’s position and that MPs vote according to the party’s line.
Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Health and for Communications and Information, is the current Government whip.
The whip is occasionally lifted to allow MPs to vote ""according to their conscience"".
Speaking to CNA on Aug 22, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that the PAP does not intend to lift the whip when the issue is debated in Parliament as it is a “matter of public policy”.
There may be consequences for MPs who do not follow the party line when the whip is not lifted. 
“The party may impose consequences for MPs who fail to vote in accordance with the party line – the most serious is that they may be expelled from the party,” said Asst Prof Ong.
“If the PAP’s whip will not be lifted, that means that the PAP’s whip will ensure that PAP MPs vote in accordance with the party line, namely, what was announced by the Government in recent days,” he added.
“So it is extremely unlikely that any PAP MP will, for example, vote against the repeal of Section 377A.”
The whip has only been lifted in Parliament on a handful of occasions. The first time the whip was lifted was back in 1969, when the House voted to legalise abortion, according to a TODAY report.
Since then, the whip has been lifted at least five times, including in July 2017 when Parliament debated the public dispute between the Prime Minister and his two younger siblings over their father's house at 38 Oxley Road.

How long will it take for it to become law?
According to the Singapore Parliament's website, Bills are typically introduced by ministers on behalf of the Government. These are known as government Bills.
Bills can also be introduced by any MP – these are known as private member's Bills.
It will take time to come up with the text of the Bills that will repeal Section 377A and amend the Constitution as the Government has described, said Asst Prof Ong.
“The text is drafted by the Legislation Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) – just as how one might engage a lawyer to draft the text of a contract or a will,” he said.
“That process takes time. As with all legal texts, precision and accuracy are paramount.”
At least two clear days before a government Bill is introduced, a notice of introduction that has been signed by a minister must be given to the Clerk of Parliament, together with a copy of the Bill, said the AGC's website.
For a private member's Bill, the notice of introduction must be given at least four clear days before the introduction of the Bill.
All Bills must go through three readings in Parliament.
On the first reading of a Bill, the long title of the Bill is read out. It is then handed over to the Clerk of Parliament who is responsible for printing and circulating the Bills to the MPs.
For most Bills, with the exception of urgent Bills, a second reading can only take place after at least 10 days have passed since it was printed and circulated to MPs and appeared in the Government Gazette.
“According to Parliament’s Standing Orders, there must then be at least 10 days for MPs to consider the Bills,” explained Asst Prof Ong.
“In practice, it could take even longer before there is time for the Bills to be debated in Parliament.”
The ensuing debate could “take anywhere from minutes to days”, Asst Prof Ong added.
On the second reading, a general debate may cover the general merits and principles of the Bill, said the AGC website.
After a Bill has been read a second time, it will stand committed to the committee of the whole Parliament, which has the power to make such amendments to the Bill as it thinks fit.
After the Bill has been considered by the committee of the whole Parliament, the Bill is ready to be read a third time.
But should the Bill require special consideration, Parliament can send it to a select committee of MPs. In such situations, members of the public are invited to make written representations to the select committee and may also be invited to give evidence before the select committee.
Deliberations and enquiries of the select committee are limited to the Bill and relevant amendments.
“After the Bill has been considered by the select committee, the Bill is then reported from the committee of the whole Parliament where it is ready to be read a third time,” the AGC website said.
“On the third reading of the Bill, amendments, if any, will be proposed. The debate at the third reading is confined to the contents of the Bill. Any reasoned amendment which raises matters not included in the Bill must be ruled out of order. The Bill is then put to vote.”
Under the Constitution, all Bills passed in Parliament - except for money Bills, urgent Bills or Bills affecting defence, security, public safety, peace or good order in Singapore - must be sent to the Presidential Council for Minority Rights.
“According to the Constitution, they have 30 days to make their report on whether the Bills have any discriminatory effect,” said Asst Prof Ong.
“If there is none, then the Bills will be sent to the President for her formal assent. Only then will they become Acts of Parliament.”
The date an Act comes into force is typically determined by the minister in charge of the Act. A commencement notification will also be published in the Government Gazette.
An Act can also state that it will only come into effect on a certain date in the future, noted Asst Prof Ong."
" Former HDB director admits to taking obscene videos, photos of men","Norman Leo Chee Wei Kiong's offences were discovered when he tried to surreptitiously film a man he found attractive in a supermarket.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ex-hdb-director-obscene-video-men-safra-locker-room-2908816,"SINGAPORE: A man on Tuesday (Aug 30) admitted to taking obscene videos and photos of men in public places such as SAFRA locker rooms.
Norman Leo Chee Wei Kiong, 61, was a director of housing finance at the Housing and Development Board in 2017, TODAY previously reported.
His lawyer informed the court that he has since resigned.
Chee pleaded guilty to four charges under the Films Act and two charges of committing a public nuisance.
Eight more charges, including one for voyeurism, will be considered when he returns for sentencing.
On Oct 28, 2020, Chee's offences were discovered after he tried to surreptitiously film a man he found attractive in a supermarket.
The man noticed this and confronted Chee, who denied filming him.
In the ensuing commotion, a supermarket employee called the police.
While waiting for the police to arrive, both men were taken to wait in the security office, and Chee agreed to delete the video of the man.
The man inspected Chee's photo gallery to ensure this was done, and noticed that it contained obscene videos featuring naked men.
He alerted police to this when they arrived. Police discovered the obscene images and seized Chee's phone for forensic examination.
During investigations, Chee admitted that he had a habit of filming and photographing men he considered attractive in public places such as gyms and communal changing rooms.
His offences date back more than a decade. On Apr 26, 2012, Chee took two photos of a man clad only his underwear in a male locker room at an unknown SAFRA clubhouse.
At a similar location on Jan 12, 2013, Chee used his phone to take five photos of a man with his private parts exposed.
On Dec 31, 2018, Chee recorded a 25-second video of a fully naked man, capturing his face and private parts, at the male locker room of SAFRA Mount Faber.
Chee also recorded obscene videos of a man, known as ""Billy"", in his own apartment.
He filmed ""Billy"" wiping himself with a towel on Dec 22, 2017 and putting on his underwear on Sep 25, 2019. Both videos were more than a minute long.
These videos were for Chee's personal gratification, according to court documents.
Through forensic examination, 146 more obscene videos showing men engaged in sexual acts were found on Chee's phone.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng sought two to three weeks' jail and a fine of S$1,600 to S$2,000.
He highlighted that Chee had taken videos and photos of unsuspecting men, and that the videos of ""Billy"" did not indicate that he knew he was being recorded.
There was no evidence to suggest Chee had circulated the videos, but there was a ""latent risk"" of this as they were in a digital format on an Internet-connected device, added Mr Ng.
Defence counsel Shashi Nathan sought no more than a week's jail, calling his client a ""very honourable man"".
He highlighted that Chee resigned voluntarily even before his conviction, and that this was a ""painful decision"" after building his career for more than 35 years.
Mr Nathan said this ""fall from grace"" had been enlightening for Chee, who had kept parts of his life hidden from people around him and was ""living under a shadow"" before the offences came to light.
He also argued that Chee was the primary caregiver for his elderly mother, who suffers from ovarian cancer.
The prosecutor countered that Chee's offences were committed in his personal capacity unrelated to his work, and that his resignation was a personal decision and not a mitigating factor.
District Judge Kessler Soh said he needed time to consider the appropriate sentence, and adjourned the hearing to Sep 9."
Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam fined for breaching gag order in case of doctor acquitted of molestation,"Journalists received trial transcripts containing unredacted information about the woman Dr Yeo Sow Nam was accused, and later acquitted, of molesting.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-breach-gag-order-victim-identity-doctor-molest-acquit-2908706,"SINGAPORE: Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, 47, was on Tuesday (Aug 30) fined S$4,000 for breaching a gag order in the case of a doctor who was later acquitted of molestation.
He led the team of lawyers for the defendant in that case, Dr Yeo Sow Nam. A junior lawyer on the team, Johannes Hadi, also faces charges related to the gag order.
Thuraisingam, the managing partner of his eponymous law firm, is a senior member of Singapore's Criminal Bar with more than 20 years in practice.
He pleaded guilty to a charge under the State Courts Act, with another charge taken into consideration for sentencing.
From Mar 1 to Mar 5, 2021, Dr Yeo was tried in private on accusations that he outraged a woman's modesty at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in 2017.
The woman's identity was protected under a court order issued on Feb 7, 2020. This prohibited the publication of her name, address, photograph or any information likely to lead to her identification.
Gag orders are usually imposed to protect minors, vulnerable persons and victims in sexual offence cases, a lawyer previously told CNA.

Gag orders: What to know about the legal provision that protects victims, 'vulnerable' witnesses













TRANSCRIPTS SENT TO MEDIA
On Mar 5, 2021, the fifth day of trial, Thuraisingam sought the trial judge's permission to distribute the transcripts of the proceedings, which were in private, to members of the media.
He gave an undertaking to the court that any distribution of the transcripts to the media would carry redactions of the woman's identity and a warning about the gag order in place.
The trial judge granted Thuraisingam's application on the basis that the lawyer would make the necessary redactions and there would be no breach of the gag order.
On Mar 16, 2021, after the team received the transcripts for the first four days of trial, Thuraisingam sent Hadi instructions over email about distributing them to the media.
""Pls remember to black out complainant's name and remind the press that they cannot print the complainant's name,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was the complainant against Dr Yeo.
""Explain that we applied for an order that we be allowed to furnish the press with the transcripts,"" he added.
Thuraisingam did not instruct Hadi to redact all information likely to lead to the identification of the woman, Deputy Public Prosecutors Sivakumar Ramasamy and Sivanathan Jheevanesh said.
Following the senior lawyer's instructions, Hadi redacted only the woman's name from the transcripts and emailed them to journalists from Mediacorp and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) on Mar 16, 2021.
In his emails to media, Hadi wrote: ""We are now releasing transcripts to you, but with the complainant's name redacted as the gag order in relation to the complainant's identity remains in place.""
PROSECUTION'S BID TO EXPAND GAG ORDER
On Jun 26, 2021, the prosecution in Dr Yeo's case applied to withdraw the charges against the doctor. At the same time, Thuraisingam indicated that the defence would apply for the gag order to be lifted.
A hearing was scheduled on Aug 16, 2021 for the charges to be withdrawn and both sides to make their arguments on the gag order lifting application.
In preparation for the hearing, the prosecution filed written submissions contesting the gag order lifting application on Aug 4, 2021.
The prosecution requested to expand the scope of the gag order to include the identities of witnesses who were the woman's colleagues, the name of the product marketed by the woman, her relationship with Dr Yeo and the name of her employer at the time.
Before the hearing, between Aug 4 and Aug 11, 2021, Thuraisingam instructed Hadi to distribute transcripts of the trial and the defence's written submissions applying to lift the gag order to members of the media.
Thuraisingam again did not instruct Hadi to redact all information likely to lead to the woman's identification, said Mr Sivakumar and Mr Sivanathan.
Accordingly, Hadi emailed a bundle of the transcripts and submissions to journalists from Mediacorp, SPH, South China Morning Post, Mothership, Yahoo News, The China Press Malaysia and The Online Citizen on Aug 11, 2021.
The front page of the bundle carried the notation: ""All transcripts have been redacted pursuant to the gag order in place at the time of writing in relation to the identification of the complainant.""
However, the transcripts contained unredacted information likely to lead to the woman's identification, including her age, date of birth, current occupation, current employer and occupation at the time of the alleged molestation.
The transcripts also contained information that was the subject of the prosecution's application to expand the scope of the gag order.
At the hearing on Aug 16, 2021, Dr Yeo was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal after the prosecution withdrew all charges against him.
Dr Yeo's lawyers then withdrew the application to lift the gag order. When the trial judge asked for the defence's position on the prosecution's application to expand the gag order, Thuraisingam said: ""If the prosecution says that it's necessary to protect the alleged complainant's identity, we take no position.""
The trial judge then granted the expanded gag order, which remains in force.

""RE-VICTIMISATION"" OF THE WOMAN
Prosecutors sought a fine of at least S$4,000, arguing that in a case involving the likelihood of the complainant being identified, the potential harm caused by Thuraisingam's offences was a key issue.
Given the number of media outlets the transcripts were sent to, with a notation that they were redacted in compliance with the gag order, the potential harm was medium if not high, the prosecutors argued.
Thuraisingam's actions were inadequate as he left the redaction to the most junior lawyer on the team, who had only two years in practice at the time, and did not check the transcripts before they were sent, said Mr Sivakumar.
The only guidance he gave was to redact the woman's name, and this conduct by an experienced member of the Bar ""fell short"", argued the prosecutor.
Defence counsel Jerrie Tan of K&L Gates Straits Law said her client accepted the prosecution's proposed fine.
Ms Tan urged the court to consider that the complainant's name, the ""most critical part"" of her identity, was redacted, and that no actual harm ensued as a result of the oversight.
She contended that Thuraisingam's email to Hadi arose out of a genuine concern that the junior lawyer might forget to redact the complainant's name and remind the press about the gag order.
Ms Tan also asked the court to consider the offences in light of ""the type of lawyer"" her client has been, highlighting his pro bono work, including defending clients facing the death penalty, and his firm's donations to the Law Society's pro bono services.
District Judge Toh Yung Cheong said that the release of identifying information to the media could have led to the ""re-victimisation"" of the complainant, which the gag order was supposed to protect her from.
Any leak of information could also affect public confidence in the legal system and the confidence of other victims to testify in court, said the judge.
He said that Thuraisingam's efforts to follow the gag order were insufficient, and this was the main cause of the breach.
The senior lawyer was entitled to ask a junior colleague to handle the transcripts, but gave incomplete instructions to Hadi and did not check the redaction before they were sent, said Judge Toh.
The prosecution's application to expand the gag order would also have alerted Thuraisingam to the fact that they were concerned about other information about the complainant being made public, said the judge.
The penalty for breaching a gag order is up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
"HDB launches nearly 5,000 BTO flats for sale in August, including Bukit Merah units under prime area model","The BTO flats will be spread across seven projects in both mature and non-mature estates - namely Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Tampines and Woodlands.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-august-2022-bto-exercise-flats-plh-bukit-merah-2908611,"SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday (Aug 30) launched 4,993 flats for sale under its August Build-to-Order (BTO) exercise.
They will be spread across seven projects in both mature and non-mature estates - namely Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Tampines and Woodlands.
The flats in Bukit Merah are being offered under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model, which comes with a 10-year minimum occupation period.
HDB said there is a wide selection of flats in the August launch to meet different budgets and needs.
In the non-mature estates, flat prices before housing grants start from S$97,000 for a two-room Flexi flat in Jurong East, S$188,000 for a three-room flat in Woodlands, and S$277,000 for a four-room flat in Choa Chu Kang.
Five-room flats in Choa Chu Kang start from S$390,000, said HDB.
Prices are higher in the mature estates, starting at S$198,000 before grants for a two-room Flexi flat in Ang Mo Kio. In Tampines, prices start at S$381,000 for a four-room flat and S$520,000 for a five-room flat.
Eligible families buying an HDB unit for the first time can benefit from the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) of up to S$80,000 to help with their new or resale flat purchase.

PROJECTS UNDER PRIME LOCATION MODEL IN BUKIT MERAH
Of the seven projects, two in Bukit Merah - Havelock Hillside and Alexandra Vale - are under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model.
The new housing model for public flats in prime areas was launched last year as part of efforts to keep housing in these locations accessible for Singaporeans.
On Tuesday, HDB says up to 20 per cent of the PLH flats in the two Bukit Merah projects will be set aside for first-timer families, and up to 2 per cent for second-timer families, under the Married Child Priority Scheme.
This is two-thirds of the usual quota.
“The reduced quota will provide more opportunities for Singaporeans who do not have family members living near the area to also have an opportunity to live in these locations,” said HDB.
Alexandra Vale also will be integrated with two-room rental flats to ensure an inclusive living environment, it added.
As PLH flats come with additional subsidies, owners will have to return to HDB a percentage of the resale price or valuation upon the sale of their flats, whichever is higher.
For Havelock Hillside and Alexandra Vale, the amount to be recovered from the flat buyers is fixed at 6 per cent and will apply regardless of when the flats are sold in future, said HDB.
This amount to be recovered is commensurate with the extent of the additional subsidy that has been provided.

Calling the new PLH projects ""plum sites"", Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, noted the good sales of previous projects under the model.
This indicates that many Singaporeans do not mind the stringent selling criteria and longer minimum occupation period of PLH model flats, said Ms Sun.
""Therefore, we expect these two projects to be similarly oversubscribed this time around,"" she added.
The two Bukit Merah projects are expected to see keen interest, said Huttons Asia's senior director for research Lee Sze Teck.
He noted that the Alexandra Vale site is next to Redhill MRT station, while Havelock Hillside is in a ""prized location"" close to the upcoming Havelock MRT station.
Since the PLH model was introduced, there have been six BTO projects under the model, said Mr Lee, adding: ""PLH flats do not seem that exclusive anymore.""
For this reason, Ms Sun said the subscription rate for the latest launches may not be as high as the first two launches.
""The pool of buyers may have shrunk as some eligible or interested buyers have already made a purchase in earlier launches,"" she added.

HDB encouraged buyers to apply for a BTO flat in the non-mature towns to enjoy a ""higher chance of success"" in securing a flat.
""There is no need to rush to submit applications within the first few hours or first few days of the application period"", said the agency, as applicants will be shortlisted using a computer ballot instead of a first-come-first-served basis.
Flat buyers should take the estimated project completion timelines into consideration before applying for a flat, HDB added.
Projects with challenging site conditions, more complex designs, large number of units or higher storeys may take longer to complete, it said.
For the BTO projects launched in August 2022, the waiting time generally ranges from three to 5.7 years, HDB said on Tuesday.
The housing board also advised home buyers looking to move into their flats sooner to consider BTO projects in Choa Chu Kang, Tampines and Woodlands, such as flats at Keat Hong Grange, Sun Plaza Spring and Woodlands South Plains, as these have the shortest waiting times at 3.8 years or less.
Huttons' Mr Lee said that as the Woodlands South Plains BTO offers more allocation to first-timers, it offers an attractive option for buyers looking to secure their first home. 
He noted, however, that it is one of the rare projects in non-mature estates that do not have any five-room flats for sale.
To meet diverse housing needs, flats ranging from two-room Flexi to five-room and 3Gen flats are also being offered in this BTO exercise, said HDB.
Applications for flats launched in the August 2022 BTO exercise can be made online on HDB InfoWEB from Aug 30 to Sep 5.
Applicants can go for only one flat type or category in one town under the BTO exercise, said HDB.
Those who wish to take up an HDB housing loan for their flat purchase need to produce a valid HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter when they book a flat, except for young couples who are eligible for deferment of income assessment.

UPCOMING BTO LAUNCH
HDB also said it would offer about 9,500 BTO flats in towns and estates such as Bukit Batok, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Tengah and Yishun in November this year, with more details to be announced.
Overall, HDB is on track to launch up to 23,000 new flats in 2022.
In February 2023, HDB will then offer about 2,900 to 3,900 BTO flats in towns and estates such as Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown and Tengah.
“HDB will launch up to 23,000 new flats in 2023, and is prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025 if needed, subject to prevailing demand,” said the board.
“HDB will continue to monitor the housing demand and adjust the plans where necessary.”

Former Marks & Spencer supervisor jailed for using customers' credit cards to order meals,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/marks-spencer-supervisor-customer-credit-card-details-2907166,"SINGAPORE: For more than a year, a supervisor at Marks & Spencer noted down customers' credit card details, which he used to buy almost S$9,000 worth of meals.
Teo Kai Seng, 29, was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for three months after pleading guilty to three charges under the Computer Misuse Act. Eight similar charges were considered for sentencing.
The court heard that Teo worked at Marks & Spencer from 2016 to 2021. He was promoted to supervisor at the One Raffles Place outlet in March 2020.
Around the time of his promotion, Teo started taking down the credit card details of customers while their card payments were being processed at the cashier.
He did this whenever he attended to customers at the cash register and there were only two other staff members working in the kitchen and the office.
Teo would use his mobile phone to take a photo of the credit card, then transfer the details to a piece of paper. He later keyed them into the Waitrr app, where he had registered an account using his ex-girlfriend's phone number.
Waitrr allows users to order food online and pay vendors directly. Teo realised that the app did not require a one-time password for transactions, and decided to exploit this.
Teo would offer to buy food for his colleagues, claiming that the Waitrr app gave him a 10 per cent discount and he would extend the savings to them.
He paid for the meals using the victims' credit card details, and his colleagues paid him back for their meals in return.
Most of the victims did not require their banks to give them SMS notifications when transactions were made on their credit cards or savings accounts.
This allowed Teo's offences to go undetected until Oct 27, 2020, when the daughter of a victim lodged the first police report. Teo was traced and arrested on Aug 24, 2021.
From Jul 13, 2020 to his arrest, Teo used credit card details belonging to 11 victims aged 46 to 82, performing 450 unauthorised transactions.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling sought three to five months' jail, highlighting the level of premeditation and planning involved in Teo's offences.
For each charge, Teo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The maximum penalties are raised to three years' jail and a S$10,000 fine for a repeat conviction."
Woman jailed for forging retrenchment letter to apply for COVID-19 Support Grant,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-support-grant-cheat-msf-forge-retrenchment-letter-2906786,"SINGAPORE: A woman was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for five weeks for forging a retrenchment letter to apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant.
Goh Chyi Chen, 42, pleaded guilty to one charge of forgery. Another charge of attempting to cheat the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) was considered for sentencing.
The court heard that Goh worked as a senior retail executive with Rigel Telecom before the offences. She was fired in May 2020 due to unsatisfactory work performance.
The reasons for Goh's retrenchment were stated in a letter issued by Rigel Telecom, and her retrenchment was not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the court was told.
The COVID-19 Support Grant, administered by MSF, provided financial assistance to Singaporeans affected by the economic impact of the pandemic.
For those who lost their job or were on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months, the grant provided a monthly cash grant of up to S$800 for three months. The cash support quantum was based on the last-drawn monthly salary, capped at S$800.
On Oct 1, 2020, Goh submitted an online application for the COVID-19 Support Grant that included a forged retrenchment letter.
She used word processing software to amend the contents of the letter, deleting all the reasons given for her retrenchment and instead stating that it was due to COVID-19.
On Oct 12, 2020, an MSF officer contacted the company to verify the letter's contents and learnt that the company did not issue the letter.
When the officer contacted Goh over the phone, she continued to claim that she was retrenched due to the pandemic. MSF eventually rejected Goh's application.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew argued that Goh's actions put public funds in peril, and pointed out that she persisted in her lie when questioned by an MSF officer.
He also said that Goh had related prior convictions for cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust, although these took place in 2004 and were relatively dated.
Defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran, who requested not more than a week's jail for his client, asked the court to consider the ""desperate situation"" Goh was in around the time she offended.
He highlighted that after the offences, Goh was diagnosed with depression by the Institute of Mental Health. Although there was no contributory link to Goh's offences, the diagnosis showed she was facing several stressors in her life that led to her mistake, said the lawyer.
Mr Nalachandran also argued that Goh's application was rejected by MSF, and no public funds were disbursed to her.
The penalty for forgery is up to four years' jail, a fine or both.

Many people still masked up in shopping malls on first day of eased restrictions ,"Some people CNA spoke to were not even aware that wearing a mask indoors was optional in most settings from Monday. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/many-people-mask-shopping-malls-first-day-eased-restrictions-2906686,"SINGAPORE: Many people were still wearing their masks in shopping centres and malls, despite the eased restrictions from Monday (Aug 29). 
Among them was Ms Aminah Johari at NEX shopping mall in Serangoon who was unaware that restrictions have lifted.
Still, Ms Aminah, who does part-time administrative work, maintained that she would continue to mask up until Singapore records fewer than 100 community cases per day.
The 61-year-old said she felt concerned about the announcement as the numbers could increase as the year came to an end. 
“Because as it is, they said cases might go up again at the end of the year and because some people, when they sneeze or cough, they do not cover their mouths (even) before the pandemic,” she said.
Others, like Ms Aminah, were not aware that restrictions have lifted. CNA observed a middle-aged man in a retail store at City Square Mall asking why an employee was not masked up while in the changing rooms. The retail staff member could be heard explaining the new restrictions.
As of Monday, indoor mask restrictions have been lifted across Singapore, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities.
Masks are still required on the MRT, LRT and public buses as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms, but are optional on private transport modes like taxis and private hire cars. 
When CNA visited shopping malls across Singapore on Monday, many people were still wearing their masks indoors, with only a handful walking around unmasked. When asked, those masked said they wore it out of habit or social responsibility. 
There were more people unmasked at Changi Airport at lunchtime, many with luggage in tow. 
Polytechnic student Lim Meng Loek, who was waiting for his friend at Changi Airport, told CNA he wore a mask because he was used to it. 
“Now there is still COVID-19, it is not totally over. So I just continue wearing,” the 20-year-old told CNA, adding that he usually takes his mask off outdoors. 
“Over time slowly … more people will take off their masks. For the first day, I just continue (to wear).”
Mr Lim said that he has caught the virus at least three times, so he feels he has developed some immunity against COVID-19. Since he has hearing issues and wears a hearing aid, it is easier for him to understand people when they are speaking to him without wearing a mask.
“(I take it off) only outside, in open spaces. For indoor spaces, I will see how, if there are fewer people I will take it off. But now we are in Changi Airport, there are a lot of foreigners coming in,” he added. 
“For me, masks are very suffocating. If we can get back to normal and take them off that would be better - I can breathe properly and we can see each others’ faces.”

Homemaker Shaleen Agrawal, who was seen seated at Jewel Changi Airport, said that she kept her mask on in the airport area as many travellers still came in from other parts of the world. 
She added that she wore her mask out of habit and will continue to do so in crowded areas.
“When we heard the news we were so happy and excited but yet on the day we are allowed to take it off we still have it on,” the 45-year-old noted while laughing. 
That said, Mrs Shaleen felt it was better to mask up. “It is for the protection of each other. I have kids in my family and I do not know whether you have elderly in yours. It is just the more responsible thing to do.” 
According to a survey by YouGov conducted on Aug 25 and Aug 26, nearly half, or 48 per cent of the 1,046 respondents said they would always wear a mask in shopping centres.
Sixty per cent of respondents said they would always wear a mask on private transport modes, and 58 per cent of them said they would always wear one at the airport or in train stations.
Private transport modes and the airport also emerged as the top indoor places respondents felt uncomfortable visiting, now that wearing a mask is no longer required, the survey showed. 
Singapore saw 1,361 reported COVID-19 locally transmitted cases on Sunday, according to figures from the Ministry of Health (MOH).

CONTINUING TO WEAR A MASK OUT OF SOCIAL PRESSURES
Others who went unmasked indoors on Monday told CNA that they would still mask up if others around them expressed their discomfort, or if establishments insisted that patrons wear masks. 
At NEX, interior designer Thomas Seah said that a retail assistant had “shouted” at him for failing to mask up while in a shop selling beauty products.
According to the 65-year-old, the retail employee claimed that his staff would get infected because of Mr Seah and that they would only change the regulations if they received a circular from the management. 
It would be in circumstances like these that he would continue wearing a mask, Mr Seah said. 
“People get nervous when I don't wear a mask, so it's more for psychological reasons (that I wear a mask). I don't want people to scream and shout,” he said. 
Others like entrepreneur Preeti Darbari said that COVID-19 has become a part of life and that there are medications to treat it. 
“I will take life as normal, and COVID-19 is like a flu, we should take it normally ... and not make a huge thing out of it so that the next generation of kids will start behaving normally again,” the 43-year-old said while unmasked in City Square Mall. She added that she did not want children to grow up “expressionless” behind a mask.

Ms Christiana Martins, who is a mother of two, said she sent both her children aged five and seven to school without masks today. Ms Martins, who is from Brazil, had just left the gym in Tampines 1 and was not wearing a mask in the shopping mall.
She told CNA she was looking forward to life returning back to normal with the lifting of indoor mask restrictions and observed that most of her older son’s classmates in Primary 1 came to school with their masks still on. 
“Here in Singapore, we already have boosters and everything seems all right, I don’t think there will be any problems if you don’t wear a mask. I feel more free and I can breathe better, because after using a mask for so long this is so much better,” she added. 
“I just felt a little bit uncomfortable because everyone was still wearing one,” said Ms Martins. After seeing everyone with their masks on in the shopping mall, she sent a message to her husband to confirm that restrictions would be lifted from today.
“I don’t judge anybody, but it is funny because you start to feel uncomfortable because you look around and you are the unique one,” she said with a chuckle. 
Polytechnic students Daniel Cheong and Isaac Tan, who are friends from church, spoke to CNA while queueing to order food at Tampines 1 - both were not wearing masks. 
“I think what made me decide (to take it off) is hearing about the news, hearing about how it is safe now, there aren’t any spikes in infections or things like that, so I think I’ll just take off my mask,” said Mr Cheong, 19. 
“The Government is doing a good job of containing the cases, so I guess for me, I feel safe to take it off.” 
The two friends also observed that many people in the mall were still wearing their masks. 
“It’s also because people are not used to taking off their masks at the moment because it’s a new rule and it has just been implemented today. I think definitely within the next few days people will start to take off their masks as they feel more safe and know the new rules better,” said Mr Cheong. 
When asked how not wearing a mask indoors felt after more than two years of wearing one throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, 20-year-old Mr Tan said he felt “quite comfortable”.
“Especially because Singapore is so hot. So when you sweat, the feeling in your mask just does not feel very good.”

‘I just felt really stupid’: How a scam victim almost lost more than S$1 million – until police and the bank intervened,"Scams were the top driver of crime in the first half of 2022 with more than 14,000 cases reported – 85% more than in the same period last year, says the Singapore Police Force.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scams-singapore-police-force-mid-year-crime-statistics-2022-victims-cheated-2906636,"SINGAPORE: At the beginning of July this year, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Simon Lam found himself in a race against the clock. 
The senior investigation officer at the Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) Anti-Scam Centre was trying to convince a scam victim over the phone that he was a real police officer. But the victim was confused, as the scammer had impersonated a police officer the day before to convince him to hand over his bank account details.
Finally, after about two hours of intervention, ASP Lam had a breakthrough.
He sent the victim a news article about the modus operandi of a government official impersonation scam. It was a carbon copy of what the victim experienced.
That broke the spell over the victim. 
“I just felt really stupid. I felt like I had been completely sucked in. I felt I should have done better,"" said 58-year-old John (not his real name). ""But at that point when I first realised I was a victim of a scam, I was hoping to get it stopped.""
John, who works in the financial services sector, was speaking to reporters anonymously at a police briefing on Friday (Aug 26) on the mid-year crime statistics. 
In the first half of 2022, scams continued to be the main driver of crime, with 14,349 cases reported.
This is an 85 per cent increase from the 7,746 cases in the same period last year.
The increase in scams drove up the total number of reported crimes to 25,593 cases, up from 18,725 cases in the same period last year, said SPF in a media release on Monday.
The total amount cheated for the top 10 scam types increased to S$227.8 million compared to S$142.5 million in the same period last year. 











RED FLAGS SPOTTED BY BANK
Recounting John's story, ASP Lam said the victim received a call from a scammer on Jun 30, claiming to be an official from the State Courts.
John was told that a company had been set up in his name and that he had to attend a court hearing due to the financial crimes committed by the company.
The call was then transferred to another scammer claiming to be a police officer. This scammer told John that he would be jailed if he did not provide his Internet banking details and credit card numbers to “facilitate investigations”. 
Struck with fear, John followed the instructions. On Jul 1, the scammers used his details to transfer S$93,000 out of his bank account to another fraudulent account.
John was told to tell the bank that he was “making an investment into a business venture”, should he be questioned about the transfers, said ASP Lam. 
Subsequent transfers totalling about S$1 million were in progress when a member of the DBS anti-scam team, Ms Elaine Tan, noticed the red flags about one-and-a-half hours after the first transfer that same day. 
One of the subsequent transfers of S$97,800 was flagged by DBS’ fraud surveillance systems as a suspicious transaction, said Ms Tan. 
“After reviewing it, I noticed a new payee was added on the same day and there was already S$93,000 transferred to the same beneficiary. So it seems odd that our customer will try to make two similar transfers to the same account,” she added. 
“My first thought was why did the customer split his transfers into two transactions? And coincidentally, (each transaction) falls below S$100,000. So perhaps was it to avoid some sort of detection?” 
Ms Tan's hunches were based on her work experience. She also noticed that the new payee was the only one on John’s payee list, indicating that he had no history of transferring money to a third party. Aside from routine GIRO deductions and salary crediting, John had also made zero transfers to a third party via Internet or mobile banking. 
“But the biggest red flag I got was that he wasn't aware of the first S$93,000 transfer when I spoke to him over the phone to verify the transactions. In fact, he claimed that he did not access his DBS Internet banking that day, let alone add a new payee or make a fund transfer,” she said. 
“I also noticed that he sounded flustered when I informed him of the completed transfer of the S$93,000. So he requested to end the call quickly and call back later.” 
It was then that Ms Tan alerted ASP Lam, who immediately contacted the victim. At the same time, the Anti-Scam Centre quickly traced and located the first transaction of S$93,000. 
“The scam proceeds were successfully seized, and this resulted in a full, 100 per cent recovery of more than S$1.1 million. No losses were incurred by the victim,” said ASP Lam. 
“BUILT A LOT OF EMPATHY AND COMPASSION WITH ME” 
In response to questions from reporters about how he was scammed despite many reports on such cases, John acknowledged that the setup was “very convincing and elaborate”. 
“They weren’t rushing. It was just protracted conversations backwards and forwards with multiple actors … And all of these were trusted authorities,” he said. 
The Telegram account that was used also had a “very convincing looking Singapore Police Force (display) picture” which made it appear very official, John added. 
“And they also built a lot of empathy or compassion with me, which sort of sucked me in. The junior police officer was, ‘Ah, I really want to help you here … we have someone who can help you with financial affairs when your accounts are frozen.’ So it got me to think they were on my side,” said the scam victim. 
“That builds a level of trust between me and them because they weren't simply threatening me with court proceedings that I have nothing to do with or imprisonment on the back of those court proceedings that clearly would be totally inappropriate. … So they sort of spent time building the relationship.” 
John also noted that the speed with which the events unfolded resulted in him not stopping to think, despite having seen multiple warnings about scams.

CNA Explains: What happens to scam proceeds and can victims get back their money?













JOB SCAMS 
Job scams, phishing scams, e-commerce scams and investment scams made up 74.5 per cent of the top 10 scam types.
Job scams topped the list, with 3,573 cases reported and S$58.5 million cheated. 
In most of these cases, victims would come across online advertisements or receive unsolicited messages over Telegram or WhatsApp from unknown numbers which offered part-time jobs with high salaries that could be performed from home, said SPF. 
One common variant required the victim to make advance purchases to help e-commerce merchants. They would also receive a commission in the process. The scammers would ask victims to provide a screenshot of the item in their shopping cart, then instruct them to make payment for the item to a bank account number provided by the scammer. 
Scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the item and the commission, but would later claim to have encountered issues with the refund and would stop paying the victims, said SPF. 
In other variants, victims who contacted the number provided would be instructed by the scammers to complete tasks online, such as liking social media posts, or reviewing hotels and restaurants on a website, for a commission. 
And in a Ponzi-like variant, victims would be asked to purchase expensive memberships before they could take part in lucrative job tasks. 
Victims would often do so until the sums became extremely high and they no longer wished to continue, said the police. Many realised they were scammed when they were told they could only get their money back after finishing all the tasks, SPF added. 
PHISHING SCAMS 
The second-most common scam type was phishing scams. A total of 2,301 cases were reported in the first half of the year involving S$7.8 million, said SPF. 
In banking-related phishing scams, calls and SMSes were the most common channels used to approach victims. 
Scammers would impersonate bank or government officials and approach victims via phone or in-app calls, such as via WhatsApp. These scammers would then convince victims to provide their bank card or account details and OTPs by pretending to assist with issues concerning the victims’ bank card or account. 
In some cases, unsolicited SMSes were sent to victims, asking them to click on the embedded link to resolve the issue. The link would often redirect victims to fake bank websites, where they were asked to key in their Internet banking details. 
In non-banking-related phishing scams, SMSes and Carousell in-app messaging were the most common channels used to approach victims. 
Victims would also receive emails or text messages from scammers impersonating entities that are known or trusted, including banks, government agencies, or companies like Grab and Netflix, added SPF. 
These emails and text messages would make fake offers or claims, such as outstanding payment for parcel delivery or disruptions to services or subscriptions, to trick victims into clicking on a phishing link. 
In the variant involving online marketplace Carousell, scammers would express interest in purchasing items that victims were selling. The scammers would then request to make payment via CarouPay to the victims’ PayNow account. 
Then the victims would receive an email purportedly sent from Carousell, instructing them to provide their Internet banking details via a phishing link or phishing PayNow QR codes.

E-COMMERCE, INVESTMENT SCAMS 
With 2,267 e-commerce scams reported in the first half of 2022 and S$8.3 million cheated, police said that the increase in e-commerce scams was “largely due to rental scams involving fake property listings”. This made up 29.6 per cent of e-commerce scams. 
In the majority of e-commerce scams, scammers would post products for sale at a lower price than the prevailing retail value to entice victims. Interested victims would then pay a deposit via bank transfer, only for their products not to be delivered. 
The most common platforms used for e-commerce scams included Carousell, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram, while one of the most common items involved in the transactions was house or room rental.
Meanwhile, S$108.8 million was cheated in investment scams, with 1,683 cases reported in the first half of 2022. 
Instagram, Facebook and Telegram were the most common platforms used in these scams. 
Most of the time, scammers would claim to be financial professionals and “cultivate victims on online platforms”, said SPF. Once lured, the victims would be introduced to investment websites or mobile apps where they would be enticed to invest and asked to transfer money to unknown bank accounts. 
In some instances, victims would earn a profit from the initial investments, leading them to believe that the investment was legitimate and lucrative, only to be unable to cash out their earnings once they transferred larger amounts to the scammers, the police said.




Listen to an ex-scammer talk about how he used to scam people:














ANTI-SCAM MEASURES IN PLACE, BUT CUSTOMER VIGILANCE MOST IMPORTANT  
Despite the numerous media reports and police advisories, people still fall prey to scams because scammers are “organised criminals”, suggested OCBC’s head of group legal and regulatory compliance, Ms Loretta Yuen, during the media briefing last Friday. 
“They are highly sophisticated. And the one thing that I've learned is that they've got a very, very strong skill set. And this skill set they have is how to hack the human brain. They do this very well.” 
Ms Yuen added that most people have cognitive bias, believing a scam won’t happen to them. But she reinforced that “scams hit everyone … not just the old or the uneducated”.  
“We are thinking how do we lift this red mist off the eyes of our customer? How do we break the spell? We are talking to experts (in) behaviour and we're also looking at our banking process to see at which point (we can) do what we call a disruption or just-in-time disruption,” she said. 
As part of OCBC’s anti-scam measures, Ms Yuen highlighted the emergency kill switch that was introduced in February this year for customers to “suspend their accounts quickly if they suspect their bank accounts have been compromised”.
The switch can be found at OCBC ATMs, in the OCBC digital app, or activated by pressing option ""8"" via the bank’s official contact number.  
To date, the switch has helped an average of 27 customers a month to prevent their accounts from being potentially compromised by scammers. 
Ms Yuen also said that the bank will deploy a team to SPF’s Anti-Scam Centre next month to “enhance the speed of recovering monies stolen through scams”. 
Police have also introduced several engagement and education tactics as anti-scam measures. 
For instance, the ScamShield mobile app has seen more than 5.1 million SMSes reported and at least 24,500 phone numbers believed to be used for scam calls have been blocked since the app’s launch in November 2020. The app’s Android version will be made available next month. 
A revamped bank quiz – made in collaboration with the National Crime Prevention Council, the Association of Banks in Singapore, MoneySense and the police – has also been rolled out.
Yet, despite the best efforts of banks to raise scam awareness through education, Ms Yuen believes education “is not a silver bullet”. 
“As much education as we put out there, one thing that is also very important is the customer vigilance. The customer must be vigilant; the public must be vigilant themselves, not to give out their OTPs … keep abreast with scam tactics, scam typologies, so they don’t fall prey,” she told reporters.  
“It takes a whole ecosystem to break the scam network. It’s not just the banks or the public sector like NCPC (National Crime Prevention Council) or the police. The customer has to work with us.” 
ASP Lam echoed similar sentiments, saying that public awareness of the various scam types and evolving scam tactics is key. 
“We can do the necessary steps to intervene quickly. But if the victims refuse to be convinced, either by their lack of knowledge on the scam which they have fallen prey to or ignorance (in) thinking they will never be a victim of scams, it will affect the recovery and intervention process,” he said. 
HOUSEBREAKING, ROBBERY, VOYEURISM CRIMES FALL
As part of the mid-year crime statistics, police also revealed that the first half of 2022 recorded the lowest number of cases of housebreaking and robbery in the past 10 years. 
There was also a decrease in voyeurism cases. These cases decreased to 216 in the first half of 2022 – a dip from 236 cases in the same period last year. 
But voyeurism cases by unknown culprits saw an increase of 5 per cent. Locations which were prone to voyeurism committed by unknown culprits were on public transport, in residential premises, and in shopping complexes. 
On the other hand, there was an increase in outrage of modesty cases in the first half of 2022. A total of 773 cases were recorded, compared to 739 in the same period last year. 
And with cyber extortion cases, police revealed an increase in cases to 203 in the first half of this year – up from 138 cases recorded in the first half of last year. 
The total amount lost by victims in these cyber extortion cases totalled more than S$754,000, with Instagram being the most common platform where victims were first approached, followed by Facebook and Tinder. 
“In these cases, criminals typically befriend victims online and subsequently coax them into performing compromising or indecent acts in front of a camera. Thereafter, the criminals would use the video footage or images to extort money or online credits from these victims,” said SPF in its news release. 
“In some cases, victims were asked to visit a link or to download an app that may result in granting the criminals access to the victims’ contact data which will then be used to extort the victims."""
Singapore to launch new work pass for top talent in all sectors from 2023,"There is a S$30,000 minimum monthly salary requirement for the new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass. Those with “outstanding achievements” in tech, arts, academia or sports can qualify even if they do not meet the salary criterion.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workers-work-employment-pass-foreign-manpower-tan-see-leng-2906656,"SINGAPORE: A work pass is being introduced that will allow high-earners and high-achievers to live in Singapore without having to secure a job here first, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said on Monday (Aug 29).
The initiative is part of plans to ensure that Singapore can compete effectively in the global fight for top talent, he said.
The Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass is meant for talent from any sector who earns a monthly salary of S$30,000 and above, or have “outstanding achievements” in the areas of science and technology, arts and culture, research and academia, or sports.
Under the salary criterion, applicants must prove that they have earned a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 in the last year or show that they will earn that minimum amount under their future employer in Singapore. 
Overseas candidates will also need to show that they have worked or will be working for an established company – defined as one with a market capitalisation of at least US$500 million or an annual revenue of at least US$200 million – either in their overseas role at the point of application, or future role based in Singapore.
It is “timely” to cement Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent at this juncture as Singapore emerges from the pandemic into a period of economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain, said Dr Tan at a press conference at the National Press Centre on Hill Street.
Noting that some countries are turning inwards but others are going out of their way to compete for global talent, he said: “In this climate, all the more, we need to be clear about where Singapore stands. We cannot leave any room for investors to doubt or to have questions as to whether Singapore remains open.

NDR 2022: Develop Singaporeans while attracting foreigners to build 'world-class talent pool', says PM Lee













“We are now in an era where businesses follow talent, as much as talent follows business. Both businesses and talent are searching for safe and stable environments to invest, live and work in. Singapore is such a place.”
Dr Tan’s comments echo those of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said at the National Day Rally on Aug 21 that Singapore must build up a ""world-class talent pool"" by developing its own workforce while continuing to attract talent from abroad.
“We want to make top talent everywhere sit up, pay attention and think seriously about coming to Singapore,” Mr Lee had said.
Mr Lee had said that countries are making a special effort to court top international talents, citing Germany and the United Kingdom as examples. Germany recently allowed skilled foreign professionals to live there even before they secure a job, he said. 
The UK introduced this year a High-Potential Individual Visa for recent graduates from the top 50 universities in the world outside the UK. Mr Lee said that the list of universities includes local varsities National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.
He added: “In this global contest for talent, Singapore cannot afford to be creamed off, or left behind.”
HOW THE NEW WORK PASS WORKS
Unlike the Tech.Pass that was introduced in January last year, the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass applies to all sectors. As its name implies, the Tech.Pass for is only for tech entrepreneurs, leaders or experts.
Applicants also do not necessarily have to meet the S$30,000 salary criterion, if they have “outstanding achievements” in arts, sports, science and/or academia.
When asked what would be considered""outstanding achievements"", Dr Tan said that the salary benchmark is a proxy but the work pass targets the top 5 per cent, or even top 2 to 3 per cent of talent in the world across these areas.
The benchmark salary of S$30,000 is comparable to the top 5 per cent of EP holders in Singapore.
MOM will work with other agencies with the relevant knowledge in these fields to identify such talent, he said.

""Some of the agencies are actively targetting (these talents) and they have some candidates in mind for us to approach them,"" said the minister.
For example, agencies could approach candidates with international awards, such as a Fields Medal, an award for outstanding mathematicians.
As for the sectors that could benefit from the new work pass, Dr Tan said one possible industry is the green economy where technologies are still nascent and new opportunities abound.
As a personalised pass, the new pass will not be contingent upon the applicant having a job in Singapore, unlike ordinary Employment Passes (EP). The work pass holder can thus start, operate and work for multiple companies in Singapore at any one time.
This is similar to an existing Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) that allows a foreigner to change employers without re-applying for an EP, and stay in Singapore for up to six months while looking for employment.
But the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass will have greater flexibility, as there is no condition that the pass holder has six months to look for work. They can also sponsor their dependents to join them in Singapore and their spouses can work with a letter of consent. Other work passes have stricter criteria for spouses to work here.
Compared to existing work passes, the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass is valid for a longer period – five years – compared with two years for the EP (new applicants) and three years for the PEP.

Pass holders will also not be subject to the upcoming Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) – a new points system for EP applicants that will kick in from Sep 1 next year. Besides salary and the candidate’s qualifications, the new system awards points based on the firm’s nationality diversity and support for local employment.
MOM said that the top talent who qualify for the new pass would likely have been able to enter Singapore under the existing EP framework, but the additional flexibility strengthens Singapore’s attraction as a global hub for talent.
“MOM will closely engage pass holders during their time in Singapore. The flexibilities offered by this pass are meant to allow pass holders to contribute meaningfully to Singapore. It is not meant to be abused as a visit or travel document,” said Dr Tan.
Applications for the Overseas Networks & Expertise pass will be open from Jan 1.

OTHER CHANGES TO WORK PASSES
The new ONE Pass was introduced along with other changes to Singapore’s work pass framework that are designed to better attract talent and to streamline processes for companies hiring them.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will introduce a five-year EP to experienced professionals filling tech jobs requiring highly specialised skills currently in shortage in the local workforce. 
These will be specified in the upcoming COMPASS Shortage Occupation List (SOL). They also have to earn a salary of at least S$10,500, and are subject to COMPASS criteria.
“This enhancement will provide greater certainty to experienced tech professionals when making major decisions on relocating to Singapore, and this will allow us to anchor tech capabilities even as we develop our local pipeline,” said Dr Tan.
There will also be changes made to the salary benchmark and work pass conditions for the top 10 per cent of EP holders or applicants from Sep 1, 2023.
Dr Tan said that MOM will set a single benchmark of the top 10 per cent of EP holders, and the salary threshold for a number of requirements for work pass applications will be aligned to this. The new threshold is set at $22,500, and will start in September 2023.
He explained: “This benchmark and streamlining are intended to give companies greater clarity on our work pass framework. With a benchmark, companies will know that future changes to the salary thresholds and criteria will be incremental.”
This will affect advertising for a job opening under the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) and the new COMPASS framework. Currently if the position’s monthly salary is S$20,000 or more, companies do not have to advertise under FCF and the candidate is exempt from COMPASS requirements. This will be adjusted upwards to S$22,500. 
FCF advertising refers to a requirement for companies here to advertise a job opening for a specified time period before hiring a non-local.
The salary benchmark for the PEP will also be adjusted to S$22,500, up from S$18,000 as of Sep 1 next year.
FASTER PROCESSING OF EMPLOYMENT PASSES
Responding to companies’ feedback, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also reduce the duration of (FCF) job advertising from 28 days to 14 days from Sep 1 this year.
Dr Tan said that the FCF advertising time was doubled in October 2020 during a weak job market, and MOM is making this adjustment now that the job market has rebounded strongly. 
MOM also promised employers that they will reduce processing time for EPs and respond to all applications within 10 business days. For now, 85 per cent of online EP applications are processed within three weeks. The ministry will also furnish reasons why the EP application failed, or was delayed, in a bid for greater transparency.
“We hope that these changes will allow companies to move with greater speed and certainty when it comes to hiring,” he said.
Dr Tan said that the goal underlying all the changes to the work pass framework is to create more, and more exciting, opportunities for Singaporeans, and grow the size of Singapore's economy.
“By bringing the best from around the world, we can tap on their networks, we can learn from their expertise, and ultimately, we will accelerate the development of our own local talent pool.”
Responding to a reporter's question on how the new pass might affect the salaries of local workers, Dr Tan said: ""I believe over the medium to long-term ... overall it will be an uplifting experience for our local Singaporeans.""
DEVELOPING LOCAL TALENT
He promised that, in tandem, Singapore will continue to invest heavily in developing the local workforce. For example, the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) mapped out growth plans for 23 sectors and for each, MOM identified in-demand jobs and skills strategies to build up the local talent pipeline.
The ministry has also launched Jobs Transformation Maps, to provide job-level insights on the impact of technology on the industry and workforce. 
Singapore agencies also have programmes to help locals gain global and regional exposure, such as the International Posting Programme that funds overseas postings for Singaporeans in the financial sector, and the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative that supports companies across sectors to develop local leaders, he said.
“We are making very systematic efforts. But when it comes to developing our own people, the work is never finished. We must keep doing more.
""Our ambition is to groom many more Singaporeans into becoming world-class leaders, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with global giants,” said the Manpower Minister. 
He added that as part of the Forward Singapore exercise, the Government will consult workers and businesses on how it can encourage even more locals to take on regional and global opportunities.
“Singapore needs to take a proactive approach to cement our position as a global hub for talent; we need send a clear message to the world that we remain open for business,” said Dr Tan. 
“We will continue to groom our local talent and our leadership pool. We must attract the best here, so we can learn from them. And support to project and send our locals abroad so that they can acquire greater regional and global exposure to take up leadership positions and be strongly anchored back home.”"
Anchor operator pre-school teachers' salaries being reviewed: Masagos ,"Revised salaries have to be"" competitive enough to retain the talent and attract new talent into the sector"", said Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/anchor-operator-pre-school-teachers-salaries-being-reviewed-masagos-zulkifli-2906501,"SINGAPORE: The salaries of pre-school teachers are being reviewed, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said on Monday (Aug 29).
""We are at a stage of reviewing them, particularly focusing right now on the anchor operators,"" Mr Masagos said. 
While he did not provide specifics, revised salaries have to be ""competitive enough to retain the talent and attract new talent into the sector"", he said. 
The ministry - which oversees the pre-school sector under the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) - hopes to make an announcement ""as soon as we can"", said Mr Masagos.
""It is a matter of necessity that reviews of salaries and expectations are made and we are doing just that,"" he said on the sidelines of a visit to a pre-school ahead of Teachers' Day which falls on Sep 2.
""If we do not adjust according to the times and needs of the industry, we will lose the talents to other industries."" 
There are five anchor operators listed on the ECDA website: PCF Sparkletots Preschool, My First Skool, M.Y World Preschool, School4Kidz and E-Bridge Pre-school. 
While remuneration satisfaction is an area that is ""poorly scored"" in general by people, salaries have to be viewed objectively, he said. Pay has to be commensurate with the work done, he added. The pre-school sector needs to continue to be attractive, he added. 
His assurance that salaries are being looked at comes after a recent announcement by the Ministry of Education (MOE) that its teachers, allied educators and MOE kindergarten educators will receive a salary increase of 5 per cent to 10 per cent from Oct 1.
Ms Julie Chang, centre director of private pre-school operator Learning Kidz@Jubilee Square which Mr Masagos visited, said the teachers will be happy that salaries in their industry are being reviewed.

""A lot of things, the Government will introduce first, they will have a first go, then we (private operators) will follow subsequently,"" she said. 
Her school reviews salaries annually, she said. 
Mr Masagos also spoke about how his ministry has also been focusing on other aspects of teachers' welfare like workplace safety, including lighting and height of furniture. 
""In an early childhood environment, they tend to sit on the floor a lot or on short chairs and this may not be good for their heath, so we are relooking at all the ergonomics that will help them,"" he said. 
Another area the ministry is looking at is mental well-being, he added. 
""A happy teacher, a well-trained teacher will also mean a happy child and well-developed child,"" he said."
"Singapore faced more cybercrime, phishing and ransomware threats in 2021","Online scams made up the top cybercrime category in Singapore, accounting for 81 per cent of cases.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cybercrime-ransomware-phishing-cybersecurity-2021-2906386,"SINGAPORE: Firms and individuals in Singapore faced an increased number of cybercrime, phishing and ransomware threats last year, according to a report released by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on Monday (Aug 29).
There were 137 ransomware cases in 2021, a 54 per cent jump from the 89 reported in 2020.
In a ransomware attack, hackers - or threat actors - use malicious software to encrypt files on a device, then demand ransom to undo their work.
The cases affected mostly small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) from sectors such as manufacturing and IT, said CSA in its annual Singapore Cyber Landscape publication.
""The around-the-clock nature of these sectors’ operations did not provide for much time to patch their systems, thus potentially allowing ransomware groups to exploit vulnerabilities,"" the agency added.
Ransomware groups targeting SMEs used a model known as ""Ransomware-as-a-Service"", which makes sophisticated ransomware strains accessible to less technically adept cybercriminals.
This made it easier for amateur hackers to use existing infrastructure to distribute ransomware payloads, said CSA.
Phishing cases also rose by 17 per cent last year, with about 55,000 unique Singapore-hosted phishing URLs - with a "".sg"" domain - observed.
In 2020, there were 47,000 such URLs identified.
Phishing refers to the practice of inducing people to reveal their personal information such as account passwords and credit card numbers. 
Social networking firms made up more than half of the spoofed targets of phishing cases, said CSA.
“This was possibly driven by malicious actors’ exploitation of public interest in WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy announcement on users’ phone numbers being shared with Facebook,” the agency added.
Scammers also exploited the COVID-19 pandemic amid the Omicron variant outbreak in late 2021 to spoof Government websites, said CSA.

ONLINE SCAMS THE NO.1 CYBERCRIME
The Singapore Police Force also reported cybercrime as a key concern, with 22,219 cases recorded last year - up  38 per cent from 16,117 cases in 2020.
Online scams made up the top cybercrime category in Singapore, accounting for 81 per cent of the cases.
Of the rest, 17 per cent were Computer Misuse Act offences and 2 per cent were cyber extortion cases.
CSA also noted there were 3,300 malicious command and control servers hosted in Singapore last year, more than a three-fold increase from 1,026 in 2020.
This was also the largest number of servers recorded since 2017.
These servers are centralised devices operated by attackers to maintain communications with compromised systems - known as botnets - within a targeted network.
About 4,800 botnet drones with Singapore IP addresses were detected daily last year, a 27 per cent drop from the daily average of 6,600 in 2020.
Cases of website defacements also fell by 15 per cent from 495 in 2020 to 419 last year, with most of the victims being SMEs.
This could be attributed to hacktivist activities moving to other platforms with potentially wider reach such as social media sites, said CSA.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT, CRYPTO SCAMS ARE TRENDS TO WATCH
In its report, CSA also highlighted the possibility of a world of differing cyber norms, ecosystems and standards in the near future, sparked by decreased global reliance on Western technology due to geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
“Russia had previously faced a major hurdle in decoupling from US technology, due to the risks that various payment services and product offerings used by Russian citizens would be suspended,” said CSA.
With sanctions imposed by Western technology firms following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s desire to wean itself off such tech is “very likely to strengthen”, the agency added.
Countries such as China are also seeking to gain self-sufficiency in advanced technology areas, said CSA.
The agency also observed that cybercriminal and hacktivist groups are taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and engaging in more malicious cyber activities for politically motivated purposes.
“This development increases the risk of reprisals, as any serious cyber incident by these groups may be used as a pretext for escalation by one side or the other,” said CSA.
Crypto-based crime has also been on the rise, largely through the use of peer-to-peer financial platforms that enable direct transactions.
The borderless accessibility of the platforms as well as anonymity features have made it difficult to track illicit activity and enforce regulations across borders, said CSA.
""Such challenges further embolden cybercriminals to perpetuate more of such crypto-based scams,"" it added.
CSA also identified a trend of cybercriminals targeting critical Internet of Things (IoT) devices in ransomware attacks, leading to significant downtime costs.
""Employees have also been known to connect their personal IoT devices to the organisation’s networks without the knowledge of security teams,"" the agency added.
""Should organisations in critical, time-sensitive industries such as healthcare be infected with ransomware, there could be serious, life-threatening consequences.""
CYBERSECURITY A 'TEAM SPORT'
Improving awareness and adopting good cybersecurity practices is key to enabling a digital economy and digital way of life, said CSA.
The agency launched initiatives such as the SG Cyber Safe Programme last year to help companies better protect themselves online, and has also introduced cybersecurity toolkits catered to different enterprise roles.
CSA also worked with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to offer SMEs pre-approved cybersecurity solutions.
""The cyber landscape in 2021 was fraught with increasingly sophisticated threats and more brazen threat actors,"" said Mr David Koh, commissioner of cybersecurity and chief executive of CSA.
""The Government has stepped up efforts to work with our stakeholders to do more, but cybersecurity is a team sport. Only by banding together and working across borders, do we stand a fighting chance against the ever-evolving threat,"" he added."
Woman jailed for scalding ex-boyfriend with hot water during argument,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-jail-throw-hot-water-ex-boyfriend-argument-scald-burn-2906341,"SINGAPORE: A woman was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for three weeks for scalding her ex-boyfriend with hot water during an argument.
Shazila Akbar Bacha, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt to the victim. Another similar charge was considered for sentencing.
The court heard that Shazila and the 31-year-old victim were previously in a relationship, and had broken up at the time of the offence.
On Jul 18, 2021, Shazila and the victim both separately went to visit their friend. They chanced upon each other along the corridor outside their friend's flat.
They got into a verbal dispute at the staircase landing near the flat, during which Shazila slapped her ex-boyfriend's cheek.
Both then went into their friend's flat, where another verbal dispute started. Shazila asked the victim why he was still there even though she had slapped him.
Shazila was also upset as the victim had made some comments that she was unable to take care of her son, Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En said.
She went into the kitchen and filled an orange plastic cup a quarter full with hot water from the dispenser. Shazila then dared the victim to repeat his statements about her not being able to care for her son.
The victim did so and Shazila threw the hot water on his chest, before throwing the cup on the floor.
The victim felt pain on his chest and called the police for assistance. He visited a clinic the next day and was found to have a first degree burn below his collarbone as a result of the incident.
He was given three days of medical leave and prescribed antibiotics and pain relief medication.
The prosecutor sought a jail term, arguing that Shazila was not provoked as she had challenged the victim to repeat his comments before splashing hot water on him.
Mr Chong also argued that the use of hot water was aggravating given the difficulty of controlling it, and the danger as it could affect greater surface areas.
Defence lawyer Mahadevan Lukshumayeh contended that Shazila had received harassing messages from the victim.
The penalty for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
CNA Explains: Will the HDB mortgage rate go up as interest rates rise?,"How is the HDB home loan rate determined? If you're buying a flat, should you choose a bank loan instead? Here's what you need to know.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-cpf-mortgage-rate-bank-loans-finance-cna-explains-2898116,"SINGAPORE: As interest rates for home loans rise, more flat buyers are borrowing from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) rather than banks to finance their homes.
At 2.6 per cent, HDB’s concessionary mortgage rate used to look expensive next to bank rates of less than 2 per cent. 
But with the US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to temper rising inflation, interest rates and mortgage rates here have risen in tandem and bank home loan rates are now topping 2.6 per cent.
Could the HDB rate also rise? Here’s what you need to know:
What is the HDB mortgage rate and who can apply for the loan?
The concessionary HDB mortgage loan interest rate is currently 2.6 per cent. 
Only home buyers below certain income ceilings can borrow from the HDB. This is S$14,000 for families, S$21,000 for extended families and S$7,000 for singles.
At least one buyer must be a Singapore citizen, and applicants must not have taken two or more housing loans from HDB before. There are also restrictions based on the home buyers’ ownership of other properties.
How is the HDB mortgage rate determined?
The current HDB concessionary loan is pegged at 0.1 per cent above the Central Provident Board (CPF) Ordinary Account rate. HDB explained in a Straits Times forum letter in 2020 that it obtains its mortgage loan funding from the Government at the CPF OA interest rate. The additional 0.1 per cent covers HDB's cost of loan administration.
As the Ordinary Account rate has been at 2.5 per cent since 1999, the HDB concessionary loan rate has been fixed at 2.6 per cent for the last two decades.
But it hasn’t always been this way, said Mr Bruce Chow, head of loan concierge at property portal 99.co.
“If we refer to the Excel spreadsheet of interest rates from CPF, it shows a 4.41 per cent interest rate on our Ordinary Account from January to June 1999. This means our HDB concessionary loan rate would have been 4.51 per cent.
""In another instance, in March 1986, the CPF Ordinary Account rate was 5.78 per cent. This means our HDB concessionary loan rate would have been 5.88 per cent,” he said.
This means that if the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate goes up, the HDB loan rate will rise as well.
How then is the CPF OA interest rate set?
The CPF Ordinary Account interest rate is pegged to the three-month average fixed deposit and savings rates of three major local banks - DBS, UOB and OCBC - but there is a legislated floor rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.
While the rate is reviewed quarterly, it has not risen above 2.5 per cent since 1999.

Current CPF interest rates higher than market rate pegs: Tan See Leng













In the CPF Board’s last review, published on May 27, the three-month average of the major local banks' interest rates, from February to April 2022, was 0.09 per cent.
With interest rates now rising, might the HDB mortgage rate rise as well?
Singcapital’s chief executive Alfred Chia said that interest rates have been abnormally low since the global financial crisis in 2008, and historically, the US Federal Reserve’s average is about 4 per cent. After recent rate hikes, it is now in the range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
Mr Chia expects the Fed to increase interest rates to about 3.5 per cent by the end of the year, but he does not think bank savings rates here will rise enough to affect the CPF OA rate.
He pointed out that in 2007, before the financial crisis, interest rates in the US rose to an average of about 5 per cent, but CPF OA rates still remained at 2.5 per cent.
“There is a mechanism in place, and it (results in) a very stable rate for HDB owners. It’s not always going to be like this, but it has been this way for 20-over years,” he said.
With rising inflation, there were questions in Parliament this month about whether the CPF interest rates should rise to keep pace, and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng’s reply was that despite the low interest rate environment, the Government has continued to pay generous interest rates due to the floor rates.
99.co’s Mr Chow said: “Currently, there may be pressure to increase the CPF Ordinary, Special and Medisave rate to keep up with inflation. However, the flip side of that would be more home owners needing to pay more for their HDB concessionary loans since their loan rates are pegged to the Ordinary Account. 
“This will be something the Government will take into consideration before deciding on any move.”
What else should home buyers take note of when choosing HDB or bank loans?
But there are other considerations other than the interest rate to think about when taking a home loan. Many first-time home buyers should consider an HDB home loan, if they qualify for it, for other reasons, said the experts.
Mr Chow said that one is the smaller downpayment compared with a bank loan. HDB allows home buyers to borrow up to 85 per cent of the property’s value versus 75 per cent for bank loans. 
There is also the option to pay the HDB downpayment with CPF and no cash. Bank loans, on the other hand, have a minimum requirement of 5 per cent to be paid in cash. 
If one takes an HDB loan, there is the option to switch to a bank loan, but home owners cannot refinance their bank loans into HDB loans.
“The interest rate over the long term is definitely more stable,” said Mr Chia, adding that those who took property loans from banks are now worried about rising mortgage rates. 
However, home owners that buy older HDB units with a shorter lease may not be able to fully utilise their CPF to pay off the housing loan, said Mr Chow. He advised buyers to check the HDB portal for the exact amount when buying older houses."
"Plans to keep transforming Singapore not just for new towns, but also mature estates: PM Lee ",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/plans-transform-singapore-new-towns-mature-estates-housing-neighbourhoods-2905536,"SINGAPORE: Plans to transform Singapore apply not only to new towns but mature estates as well, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 28). 
Speaking at a National Day celebration dinner in his ward of Teck Ghee, Mr Lee cited the neighbourhood as an example of how mature estates will not be left out. 
His comments come a week after his National Day Rally speech, where he shared the country's plans to develop new towns such as Jurong Lake District, the Greater Southern Waterfront, and Paya Lebar.
""Each new estate will be more liveable, greener, and more sustainable than the previous one,"" he said during his National Day Rally speech.
When Paya Lebar Airbase is relocated from the 2030s, an estimated 150,000 new private and public homes - roughly the size of Punggol and Sengkang - can be built in the area. 
In addition, some building height restrictions around the airbase such as in Hougang, Marine Parade and Punggol can also be lifted to maximise space and include more amenities.
At the National Day celebration dinner in Teck Ghee on Sunday, Mr Lee shared plans on how the neighbourhood will be improved. 
This includes estate upgrading works in selected blocks at Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, which are slated to be completed by the third quarter of next year. A new PCF Sparkletots centre was also opened last month.
“This will provide more accessible and affordable childcare for young families,” he said.
There are also plans to redesign and upgrade Ang Mo Kio town centre to make it more accessible to residents.
This will be done by adding more greenery, seats and shelters, said Mr Lee. 
The first phase of upgrades, which includes the area outside AMK Hub, is expected to be completed as early as the second quarter of next year, said Mr Lee.

8 blacktip reef sharks found dead in waters off Pulau Hantu,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/blacktip-sharks-dead-pulau-hantu-gills-damaged-marine-stewards-2905381,"SINGAPORE: Eight blacktip reef sharks were found dead, with their gills damaged, in the waters off Pulau Hantu on Sunday (Aug 28) morning. 
Divers found the carcasses of the juvenile sharks during a routine dive at the island, which is located off the south of Singapore.
One of them, dive guide Rasaalika Singhania, described what she saw as a ""devastating scene"".  
She said: ""When my dive buddy pointed out the first one, I was confused and examined the body to try to understand what might have happened.
""Its jaw and fins were intact. There were several stab and slash wounds. Then a couple of metres forward we saw another, and another, and another."" 
Non-profit conservation group Marine Stewards said in a Facebook post that it was ""saddened"" to hear diver reports on the dead sharks. 
It said that several divers counted about eight dead blacktip reef sharks, all at around the same area - Hantu Jetty - at a depth of 10 to 11m. 
Photos posted on its Facebook page showed the dead sharks with their gills ripped or shredded. 
Responding to CNA's queries, a Marine Stewards spokesperson said that according to the diver's accounts, all the sharks had damage to their gill areas. 
""This might have been caused if they had been caught in a net. The gill area is more fragile and may have been injured in their struggle.
""We are not absolutely sure at this stage and perhaps a post-mortem may be able to reveal more answers,"" said the spokesperson.
The spokesperson added that gill nets are ""generally an indiscriminate killer"" and catch anything that passes through. 
""There have been cases in recent years of turtles and blacktip sharks getting caught in them.""
Another diver who saw the dead sharks on Sunday, Mr Tsu Soo Tan, said that the first one he saw had its mouth torn, ""like a hook and line had been torn off"". 
He then spotted another three with the same injury on his way back to the boat. 
""It was on another dive that another diver noticed the wounds at the gills of all the dead sharks that looked like they have been speared across through the part near the gills,"" said Mr Tsu.

UNDERWATER TRASH
Ms Rasaalika said that it is rare and a privilege for divers to see a shark in Singapore waters.
""I've never seen one underwater till today. And I saw (dead sharks).
""Sharks are critical to our ecosystem and I cannot begin to fathom why someone would do this."" 
Ms Rasaalika added that she saw a lot of trash underwater during the dive, and retrieved multiple fishing lines about 20 to 30m in total, as well as large lead fishing weights and hooks tangled around the corals. 
""All of this suffocates corals, traps creatures big and small, and devastates the ecosystem,"" she said. 
In 2021, at least 12 young black-tipped reef sharks, along with other marine creatures, were found dead in a 500m-long gill net at Pulau Semakau.

Singapore's William Goh among 20 new cardinals inducted by the Pope in Rome,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-cardinal-william-goh-appointed-pope-rome-2904886,"SINGAPORE: Cardinal William Goh, the leader of Singapore's Catholic Church, was appointed as a cardinal on Saturday (Aug 27).
At a ceremony known as a consistory in St Peter's Basilica in Rome, head of the Catholic Church Pope Francis inducted 20 cardinals from around the world, including Archbishop Goh.
The ceremony marked the eighth time Pope Francis has put his stamp on the Church's future with a new intake of cardinals who will serve as his top advisers and administrators at the Vatican and around the globe.
Those under 80 - 16 among the 20 newcomers - can enter a conclave to elect a new Pope from among themselves after Pope Francis dies or resigns.
Cardinal Goh, 64, who is the fourth leader of the Catholic Church in Singapore, is one of the 16 who meets the cut-off age.
He was also assigned a titular church in the diocese of Rome - the Church of Santa Maria Regina Pacis in Ostia Lido.
In a statement issued by the Catholic Church in Singapore, it said: ""The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore is jubilant and rejoices! From our very own, has risen one who is now appointed to the Sacred College of Cardinals.""

The other new cardinals come from Britain, South Korea, Spain, France, Nigeria, Brazil, India, the United States, East Timor, Italy, Ghana, Paraguay and Colombia.
Pope Francis, who chose men who mostly agree with his vision of a more progressive and inclusive Church, told the new cardinals to show concern for ordinary people despite the high rank that will bring them into contact with the powerful of the earth.
""A Cardinal loves the Church, always with that same spiritual fire, whether dealing with great questions or handling everyday problems, with the powerful of this world or those ordinary people who are great in God's eyes,"" the Pope said.
Sitting before the main altar of St Peter's Basilica, Francis asked them to remember ""poor families, migrant and homeless persons"".
He read his homily in a strong voice, often going off script, even to joke about a Rome priest who was so close to his parishioners that he knew not only all their names, but also the names of their dogs.
Francis, elected as Pope in 2013, has now chosen 83 of the 132 cardinal electors, or about 63 per cent.
With each consistory, Francis has continued what one diplomat has called a ""tilt towards Asia"", increasing the likelihood that the next Pope could be from the region that is a growing economic and political powerhouse.
With the latest August 2022 consistory, Asia will have 21 cardinals.
The 85-year-old pontiff told Reuters in an interview last month that if he does resign in the future for health reasons - instead of dying in office - he has no plans to do so anytime soon. This means he could name even more cardinals as soon as next year."
Sambar deer killed in accident along BKE,"The particular area is known for the presence of sambar deers, according to the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES).
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sambar-deer-killed-accident-bke-2904356,"SINGAPORE: A sambar deer was killed in a road accident along the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) at night on Thursday (Aug 25).
In response to CNA's queries, the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) said that it received a call about the deer at about 10pm, and that it understood that the animal had had got into an accident.
""Unfortunately, the team were stuck handling several other cases. We understand that the public had contacted NParks (National Parks Board) as an alternative and they had attended to the case,"" an ACRES spokesperson said.
ACRES noted that the particular area is known for the presence of sambar deers.
""This unfortunate animal likely ventured too near to (a) residential area by mistake, panicked and tried to cross the expressway,"" it added.
""We hope that the motorists involved did not sustain any injuries.""

CNA understands that the deer was later removed from the scene of the accident.
NParks group director of wildlife management Adrian Loo said in response to CNA queries that it was aware of the incident.
""This is the only incident involving a Sambar Deer that we know of on an expressway this year,"" said Mr Loo.
The Land Transport Authority cautioned motorists against using two lanes before the Kranji Expressway exit on the highway on Thursday.
Sambar deer are a globally vulnerable species. They are one of the largest deer species in the world, after the moose and the elk. It is most active at dusk and at night, resting in the day among thick vegetation, according to NParks' website.
They have been previously spotted using the nearby Mandai Wildlife Bridge, a dedicated animal crossing that provides safe passage over Mandai Lake Road, which has seen roadkill incidents in the past.

Video killed the Instagram star? How Instagram's push towards Reels is affecting local photographers,"As Instagram’s changing algorithm pushes video content over photos, some local photographers are seeing a dip in engagement and are finding it harder to reach potential clients.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/instagram-reels-photographers-engagement-rate-followers-2900956,"SINGAPORE: You may have noticed photo-sharing app Instagram pushing more Reels – its version of short-form video content – onto your feed lately. 
Beyond mere irritation, the change in algorithm is unlikely to significantly impact most users. Eventually, users either give in to the social media behemoth’s new direction or find an alternative. 
But those like local wedding photography company Love Me Tender Films, who depend on the platform to make a living, must adapt – or risk affecting their rice bowl.
The six-year-old company's brand manager, who wanted to be known only as Hazicky, said it is common for the local photography scene to be “highly driven” by social media trends, from editing styles to colour grading and even photoshoot locations and concepts.
But Instagram’s changing algorithm has managed to put a dent in their engagement on their account @lovemetenderfilms. 
“We’ve found that the age of growing your followers organically is over. Organic posts now turn out an engagement rate of a measly five to 10 per cent of our following, as compared to 50 to 60 per cent before,” said the 32-year-old Mr Hazicky. 
“I’m not entirely sure when this changed but I have not been satisfied with organic engagements at least since the pandemic.”

CNA Explains: Meta's revenue has fallen for the first time. Are we so over Facebook and Instagram already?













“MAKE INSTAGRAM INSTAGRAM AGAIN”  
In July this year, Instagram’s new changes came under fire. These changes included playing up short-form video – or Reels – and displaying it full-screen the way TikTok does, and recommending posts from strangers.
Celebrity sisters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were some of the more vocal users who posted messages on social media calling for the company to ""make Instagram Instagram again"" and stop trying to be like TikTok. 
In response, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri argued that the shift to videos would happen even if the service changed nothing. He said users are increasingly sharing and seeking video snippets, and that Instagram would “have to lean into that shift”. 
Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg backed that position, saying people are watching more videos online. Meta, which owns Instagram, is among the companies facing increased competition from TikTok for people's attention.

These gripes from users are relatable to Mr Yafiq Yusman, who honed his mobile photography skills during Instagram’s infancy in the early 2010s. 
The 29-year-old, who showcases creative and unconventional shots of architecture at his account @yafiqyusman, saw Instagram transform from being a platform that heavily focused on the photography community to a “marketing tool”. 
“Changes are pretty much constant … But last time, there was no pressure. After a while, I think around 2013 or 2014, people started to see Instagram as a marketing tool and a lot of things changed,"" he said.
""The essence of photography is not there anymore. It's kind of sad, but it is what it is.” 
While Mr Yafiq said he couldn’t tell if his engagement has been affected by the new algorithm since he took a break from photography for a few months this year, he has noticed more engagement on his Reels after he returned. 
“At first I thought (the lower engagement on photo posts) was because I wasn’t active. But it’s obvious they focus on Reels. Like the TikTok algorithm. It’s very successful,” he said. 
“On a few Reels I posted recently, which I took last year … the engagement is pretty much the same as last time before they changed the algorithm. But it just somehow (feels) weird … because as a photographer, our main focus is static photos.” 
Mr Yafiq added that he loves sharing, as well as the idea of change. Even though “creating a video takes a lot of time” as it is “so different”, he reminds himself that “people just have to adapt to the changes”.

ADAPTING TO CHANGE
With the new algorithm inevitably inching its way onto the feed, Love Me Tender Films has decided to go with the flow by venturing into “more brand-consistent photo slideshows” in the form of Reels.
This has provided a “better return on engagement”, averaging 30 per cent of their following.
“It’s our way of staying true to our principles without selling out to the ongoing trends of the time,” explained Mr Hazicky. 
“The push for Reels on our feed isn’t just taking attention away from photographs. Showing random Reels from accounts we don’t follow is also taking attention away from the accounts that we do follow. Which is why businesses now have to spend more on ads to force their way into the scrolling feed of their own followers.” 
Mr Hazicky shared that Love Me Tender Films had to increase their advertising expenditure “dramatically” by about three times over the past two years to hit their yearly targets, as they can barely expect new queries without spending on ads. 
He added that while there has not been much change in the number of clients per year, they have observed that clients only make bookings about three to six months before their big day. This is in comparison to booking a year or earlier in advance in the past. 
In the long run, however, the company has its sights set on expansion beyond Singapore since the market is “much larger”, he said.
For Mr Bryan Seah, who works as a freelance motion graphics designer as well as a wildlife photographer, adapting to Reels on his account @b.seahphotography was not difficult even though he does not use TikTok.
The 25-year-old previously worked at local YouTube production company Night Owl Cinematics, where he learnt videography, video editing and scripting skills. 
“I try to do Reels once a week just to test the algorithm, but other than that, it doesn't affect my usual engagement much. And I think with more video editing phone apps coming out, most of the younger people will also be able to adapt easily,” he told CNA. 
“I think working in this industry also made me understand the importance of adapting to the changes.”

WORD-OF-MOUTH STILL IMPORTANT
Still, while photographers don’t dismiss the importance of keeping up with trends or embracing Instagram’s changes, some pointed to good old email or word-of-mouth as their go-to method to secure clients.
For instance, Mr Seah might occasionally dabble in Reels at the moment, but he does not see the algorithm affecting his business. He noted that he has already built a “small base of followers” who look to him for wildlife walks and wildlife photography tips.
“Most of my sponsored products were through Instagram Stories or word-of-mouth referrals, hence I don’t really (see) any impact on my client side. In fact, most of my clients for wildlife photography and wildlife walks also come through word-of-mouth,” he said. 
“The reach from viral Reels mostly comes from overseas. So I think even getting a huge amount of engagement will not increase my client base much.” 
Thomas (not his real name), who has been a photographer for five years, also prefers to get his main clientele – architecture firms, interior design firms and hospitality groups – through tried-and-tested methods.
The 29-year-old has a carefully curated Instagram feed that speaks to his clean style. But at just over 150 photos, with the occasional lifestyle and travel shot, he admits to rarely posting. He also has not published any Instagram Reels.    
“I think most would agree it takes a lot of time and effort to curate the most ideal feed. And for someone with a perfectionist mindset, or trying to be a perfectionist, it’s challenging. Therefore, only when I do have the mood, I will post the photos in batches,” he explained. 
“But when I do (post), usually I get a few enquiries about my service. I guess it’s more like, 'Hey! I’m still here and photographing, if you’d like to work together, feel free to drop me a message' (that) sort of approach.” 
That said, Thomas admitted that Instagram has helped him reach clients past and present by being a “secondary platform” to showcase his portfolio. While he might not put all his eggs into that basket, he believes there is “no harm in relying mainly on Instagram” to get one’s name out in this day and age. 
“In fact, it could be said that it might be the primary portfolio most people will check out first. … Most people would rather visit your Instagram first before checking your portfolio website,” he said. 
“With either Instagram Stories or Instagram posts, it creates awareness, and in return, generates potential leads and enquiries from clients.”

Similarly, Mr Bryan van der Beek, who has been a photographer since 2000, considers himself “fortunate” to have made contact with clients during his days as a newspaper photographer. 
That, together with word-of-mouth referrals and “an association with certain camera brands”, have given him “some visibility” and allowed him to expand his pool of clients. 
“I have been fortunate enough to have clients refer me to other clients, so have not been as hard hit as some photographers when it comes to social media reach,” said the 46-year-old who runs his own company BryanV, which does commercial and editorial work. 
“I don't have a large social media following, but also keep my social media feeds as organic as possible and not do anything to acquire followers or likes. That said, I think the new algorithms, more often than not, bury my work because it doesn't fit the stereotypical style of most influencers,” he added.
“I also tend to not digitally manipulate my images, so it's harder to get ‘wow’ images that are mostly computer composites.”
Mr van der Beek admitted that the new algorithm may have affected him due to his “lack of followers”. His account @bryanvanderbeek has about 2,500 followers. 
“Companies that would have previously used me as a KOL (key opinion leader) now look at the number of followers as a prerequisite of sponsorship or commissioning me to work on various campaigns,” he said. 
“That said, I have been fortunate enough to have brands as clients who are supportive of the work that I produce, and are happy to amplify them on their social media platforms.”

STICKING TO BRAND VALUES 
Yet, whether they choose to pick up Reels or stick with what they know best, photographers said they would adhere to their values. 
While Mr van der Beek sees value in “reproducing the trends” that are targeted towards the same markets that influencers cater to, he plans to “keep shooting photos that I love and that mean something to me”. 
“I will keep posting these in the hopes that people will value the content over the eye candy,” he said. 
At Love Me Tender Films, the changes have not affected business in a big way despite increasing advertising expenses, partly because they have adapted by “sticking to our principles”, said Mr Hazicky. 
“We’ve always remained consistent in the quality of our work and what we stand for, which helps because we now mostly attract couples who hire us specifically because they love our work,” he said.
“We know that weddings are personal in nature, and that translates even to how we perceive them and create our work.”
With every client, Mr Hazicky added, the team establishes their relationship with the couples by “informing them that our best work is achieved when they allow us the trust and creative freedom to turn up at their wedding, to get to know them and their families personally, so we may find direct inspiration there”. 
“It’s part of our working conditions that we demand creative discretion. This allows us to stick to creative beliefs that are consistent with our brand, and as such do not follow the whims of passing trends on social media,” he explained.
“Even when it comes down to photoshoot locations, we prefer to do the legwork of going on photowalks to find hidden corners around Singapore so we can produce something unique for each couple. That is how we’ve managed to stand out throughout these years.”"

Singapore Grand Prix renews contract to host Formula 1 night race













The Singapore Grand Prix was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This year's event will be held from Sep 30 to Oct 2, after a contract was signed in January for Singapore to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix for another seven years - the longest extension for the race to date.
""The organisers SGP expect a sellout event by the time we come to the weekend itself, and most importantly, it's a clear signal that Singapore is back strong,"" said Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
He added: ""How much further it will go ... is a function of both the capacity that the organisers are able to make available and ... we have to make sure that the event's quality and the experience that the racegoers have is preserved.""
The minister said that more than 40 per cent of the participants are usually from overseas and this should remain unchanged or could be exceeded this year.
The 2019 race drew 268,000 spectators over three days, while in 2008, 300,000 people attended the inaugural race. CNA has contacted organiser Singapore GP on the expected capacity this year.

Pointing to the F1-themed activities at the West Coast Community Centre, Mr Iswaran said that community outreach is an important part of the F1 event.
""The objective is to bring the buzz, excitement and the experience of F1 to all parts of Singapore, including our heartlands,"" he said.
He noted that there is a GP roving truck with race simulators which has been to about 17 locations, including community centres and schools. F1 screenings have been held at Suntec City, PLQ Mall and Dempsey, and will be going to more locations.
Mr Iswaran said that as a major event that attracts international visitors, the Grand Prix also draws other kinds of activities like MICE events and various types of conferences.
This year, Singapore will host the Milken Institute Asia Summit, as well as the Forbes Global CEO Conference, both of which will be held days before the Singapore Grand Prix.
""The benefit overall is for our tourism industry, in particular hospitality - so the hotels benefit, the air travel industry, but also equally, the F&B and our retail sector as well,"" said Mr Iswaran.
""Overall, I think it's a positive impact for the broader hospitality and other sectors that are associated with the Formula 1 event.""

Mr Iswaran said that there are many Singapore SMEs, contractors and service providers supporting the organisation of the race, totalling about 30,000 people.
""I think it's a very strong and positive signal on the recovery in our hospitality sector,"" he said.
""The hotels are gearing up, the hotel managers (and) GMs I have spoken to are very positive about the Formula 1 this year. They say the bookings are strong, the room rates are strong and they have been able to mobilise the manpower.""
Responding to a reporter's question about concerns over the environmental impact of the race, Mr Iswaran said that sustainability is a national objective for Singapore.
He noted that many of the F1 teams already have arrangements with fuel suppliers to introduce biofuels and other kinds of sustainable fuels.
""We will make sure that the Singapore race does its best ... to be conducted in a sustainable way for now and for the whole duration of the contract and the period that we hold the race in Singapore.""

"Two more workplace fatalities, including worker hit by forklift at Kranji Water Reclamation Plant","The Manpower Ministry says it will introduce further measures to strengthen safety, as the number of workplace fatalities rises to 36 this year.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-fatalities-kranji-water-reclamation-plant-mom-manpower-ministry-safety-2903941,"SINGAPORE: Two more workplace fatalities were reported in August, including a 65-year-old man who was hit by a forklift at Kranji Water Reclamation Plant.
This brings the number of workplace deaths to 36 this year, of which five occurred this month, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Saturday (Aug 27).
The incident at Kranji Water Reclamation Plant happened on Aug 25.
The worker, a 65-year-old Singaporean man, was hit by a forklift while loading it onto a lorry. 
""While he was securing the forklift to the lorry, the forklift suddenly moved forward and ran over him,"" said MOM, adding that he was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where he died later that day.
Water agency PUB, which operates the plant, said that the worker was at the facility to collect a forklift rented by its contractor SANLI Engineering and Construction. 
SANLI was carrying out works at the plant and had engaged the man's employer, Synergy-Biz, to transport the forklift.
""PUB express our deepest condolences to the deceased's family. We are in touch with our contractor to render support to the family,"" the agency said in a statement on Saturday, adding that together with its contractor, it will assist MOM with investigations.
The other fatality involved a 32-year-old Bangladeshi rigger who died on Aug 26 at a construction site at 60 Woodlands Industrial Park D Street 2.
An employee of Senda Construction, he was working on unloading the base of a concrete lamp-post via a lorry loader at a construction site.
""During the unrigging, the load toppled onto him,"" said MOM. ""He was pronounced dead at the scene by an SCDF paramedic.""
The Manpower Ministry said it is ""deeply concerned"" with the high number of workplace fatalities this year.
It will introduce further measures to strengthen workplace safety, adding that more information will be announced when a review is complete.

MORE SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE
MOM has ramped up inspections and enforcement actions since April.
In June, it also announced measures such as higher composition fines for offences that were uncovered during inspections.
In addition, MOM revised the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Guidelines for Design for Safety, and provided detailed checklists for developers and contractors.
This will allow them to incorporate safety in the planning and design phase of projects, said Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad on Thursday.
He also stressed that companies need to be self-motivated to be safe, and this often depends on the culture and processes set by top management.
To encourage that, MOM is finalising the Code of Practice (COP) on Chief Executives’ and Board of Directors’ WSH Duties.
The COP will highlight WSH responsibilities for management and boards, and the courts may consider the COP when assessing the culpability of company leaders and its board when an accident occurs.
On Saturday, the ministry reiterated that employers must take more responsibility for the safety of all their workers.
""All workers must also place safety as their priority, watch out for unsafe workplace practices, and bring them to the attention of supervisors and MOM,"" it added.
""MOM expects all employers and supervisors to give their utmost priority to the safety of their workers. Employers of recent fatalities have been instructed to stop all work and thoroughly review their systems and processes.""

NParks to manage consultants for environmental impact assessments of nature-sensitive projects,"This approach is aimed at consolidating information on Singapore’s biodiversity and enhancing standards across the industry, says NParks.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nparks-environmental-impact-assessment-consultancy-biodiversity-nature-clementi-forest-2903851,"SINGAPORE: Consultants who are engaged to assess the environmental impact of developmental works on an area's biodiversity will be centrally managed by the National Parks Board (NParks) from 2023, instead of the developers.
Announcing this on Saturday (Aug 27), Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said authorities will pilot this approach with new Housing and Development Board (HDB) and JTC development projects that require an environmental impact assessment (EIA). 
""This move will further strengthen the EIA framework by enhancing standards across the industry and consolidating information on Singapore’s biodiversity,"" said NParks in a media release.
Under the current EIA framework, proposed development projects that are close to sensitive nature areas, marine or coastal areas, or have potential transboundary impact undergo an in-depth consultation process.
During this process, technical agencies determine if an EIA is required.
An EIA typically consists of a baseline survey, assessment of environmental impact and the creation of mitigating measures, as well as an environmental management and monitoring plan.
Developers are required to consult the relevant technical agencies on the scope of the EIA and engage a consultant to carry out studies.
They must also share the report with relevant agencies and the public.
Going forward, NParks said it will engage EIA consultants through a centralised demand aggregate tender.
It will also manage consultants directly on behalf of the agencies.
“This will enable NParks to work more closely with the consultants to standardise survey methodologies and develop industry best practice guidelines,” said the agency.
It added that information from various EIAs will be consolidated in a centralised biodiversity database to facilitate long-term monitoring and research.
The move will reduce the time needed for developing agencies to call for tenders, and consultants preparing bids for each project, said NParks.
""This will translate to potential time and cost savings by minimising duplicative work,"" it added.
The new approach to managing consultants follows discussions last year on how authorities will strengthen the EIA framework, after forest areas in Kranji were mistakenly cleared before the conclusion of an environmental study.
Mr Lee said authorities will decide later whether to introduce the new approach involving NParks to all government projects.
""We remain committed to safeguarding our natural heritage and transforming Singapore into a City in Nature,"" he said in a Facebook post on Saturday.

CLEMENTI NATURE CORRIDOR
NParks also said on Saturday that it has called for an EIA for the development plans for Clementi Nature Trail, which links the Clementi Forest Stream to a new nature park in Ulu Pandan West.
The trail is part of the larger Clementi Nature Corridor.
To supplement the biodiversity baseline survey in the EIA, NParks organised a citizen science survey this weekend to study the flora and fauna along Clementi Forest Stream.
“The data collected will help to guide habitat enhancement efforts for the area, such as the choice of plant species along the stream banks to support aquatic biodiversity,” said NParks.
Mr Lee, who was with participants at Clementi Forest on Saturday, added: “Ensuring that we take a science-based approach towards protecting our biodiversity is important and we remain committed to carrying out EIAs for development projects close to nature areas.”
He also said that the EIA processes will be regularly reviewed to ensure they remain “robust and relevant”.

"More new flats to be set aside for first-time homebuyers, starting from BTO exercise on Aug 30","At least 95 per cent of the four-room and larger BTO flat supply in non-mature estates will be set aside for families applying for the first time, up from current 85 per cent currently.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bto-hdb-first-timer-non-mature-flats-estates-mnd-second-timer-2903591,"SINGAPORE: With effect from the next Build-to-Order (BTO) launch on Aug 30, more newly constructed flats will be allocated to families and singles applying for the first time, in view of strong housing demand from this group and to increase their chances of securing their first homes.
In a joint press release issued on Saturday (Aug 27), the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) announced that from the August 2022 BTO exercise, at least 95 per cent of four-room and larger flat supply in non-mature estates will be set aside for first-time family applicants - up from 85 per cent currently.
For three-room BTO flat supply, at least 85 per cent of the quota will be set aside for these families, up from 70 per cent now.
""For mature estates, we will continue to set aside at least 95 per cent of BTO flat supply for first-timer families,"" said MND and HDB.
For first-time single applicants, up to 65 per cent of non-senior two-room flexi flats in non-mature estates will be set aside for them, up from 50 per cent currently.
The agencies noted that first-timers continue to form the bulk of BTO applications, with the number of such families seeking new flats increasing from more than 19,000 in 2018 to about 34,000 in 2021.
There were 4.1 first-time family applicants per BTO flat in 2021, compared with 2.2 in 2018.
In 2021, there were 7.5 first-time single applicants per two-room flexi flat in non-mature estates, up from 5.1 in 2020.
""We also recognise that first-time applicants generally have more pressing and immediate housing needs to start their life plans,"" said MND and HDB. 
The BTO allocation quota has been previously revised based on demand from both first-time applicants and second-time family applicants.
In 2012, the quota for all BTO flats in non-mature estates for second-time applicants was increased; and in 2009, the BTO quota for first-time families was increased amid tight housing supply.

Huttons Asia's senior research director Lee Sze Teck said the increase in first-time BTO applicants was due to rising resale flat prices, rising interest rates and BTO completion periods recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels.
""This is definitely good news for first-timers as some of them may be priced out of the resale market amid rising interest rates,"" he said.
SECOND-TIMER SUPPORT
HDB said on Saturday that it would continue to set aside part of the BTO supply for second-time family applicants, while ensuring that those in this group in need of subsidised housing will continue to have access to BTO flats.
""We will continue to set aside 5 per cent of two-room flexi and three-room BTO flats in non-mature estates for divorced or widowed parents with child, under the Assistance Scheme for Second-Timers (Divorced/ Widowed Parents),"" MND and HDB said in its press release.
""Public rental households who are able and ready to move to homeownership will continue to enjoy priority under the Tenants’ Priority Scheme.""
These households can also access the likes of the Fresh Start Housing Grant and Step-Up CPF Housing Grant, and receive guidance from HDB's Home Ownership Support Team, to help them own a flat.
Huttons' Mr Lee said Saturday's news was ""not good"" for second-time BTO applicants. 
""They are allocated fewer BTO flats to upgrade, right-size or move laterally to another flat,"" he noted.
""This means they may have to turn to either the resale HDB market, stay put, buy an executive condominium (EC) or private condominium ... It remains to be seen if the lesser allocation to second-timers will worsen the supply crunch in the HDB resale market.""

Last year, HDB announced that it would launch up to 23,000 BTO flats per year in 2022 and 2023, a 35 per cent increase from the 17,000 launched in 2021.
The board also said then that it was prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats in total from 2021 to 2025, if needed.
""The increased supply of flats will provide more affordable housing options for BTO applicants, including young couples in their marriage and parenthood journey, as well as second-timer families, seniors and singles,"" said MND and HDB on Saturday.
""We will continue to closely monitor the situation and explore other ways to provide further support to first-timers and other groups in their homeownership journey.""
The agencies also advised flat buyers to maximise their chances of securing a home by considering the following:
Apply for BTO flats in non-mature estates. First-time family applicants who have been unsuccessful in two or more BTO flat applications in non-mature estates will be given an additional ballot chance at their subsequent BTO flat application in a non-mature estate. Virtually all first-timer families applying for BTO flats in non-mature estates have been successful within their first three tries.
Refer to the median application rates on the HDB Flat Portal during the BTO exercises and consider flat categories with lower application rates, to improve their chances of securing a flat.
Book a flat when invited to do so. For first-timer families who turn down one chance to book a flat in the BTO or Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise, any additional ballot chances accumulated from past unsuccessful BTO applications in non-mature estates will be set to zero. Those who turn down two chances to book a flat will be considered as second-time applicants in the computer ballot for one year, and may find themselves taking a longer time to secure a new HDB flat.
Flat buyers with specific locational preferences or more immediate housing needs may also consider buying a resale flat on the open market, where first-time families may be eligible for up to S$160,000 in housing grants.

"6 new highlights at Fort Canning Park, from interactive heritage gallery to expanded spice garden","The opening of a new Fort Canning Heritage Gallery and an expanded Spice Garden is in conjunction with the Singapore Night Festival.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fort-canning-park-opening-new-heritage-gallery-spice-garden-2902976,"SINGAPORE: A new gallery tracing the heritage of Fort Canning Park and an expanded spice garden opened at Fort Canning Park on Friday (Aug 26).
The heritage gallery will give the public an opportunity to learn more about the park's history, while the spice garden has grown to feature more varieties of plants, herbs and spice trees, the National Parks Board (NParks) said in a press release.
These attractions were due to open in 2021 but were delayed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing manpower crunch.
Here are the details of the new attractions available at Fort Canning Park.





HERITAGE GALLERY
Housed in the newly refurbished Fort Canning Centre, the heritage gallery is spread over five zones on two levels of its south wing.
Excluding an introduction zone, each zone is themed according to a particular role that Fort Canning Hill played in the history of Singapore, NParks said.
The themed zones include Singapore's development since the 14th century, Fort Canning Hill's development as a military base, the hill's changes over the decades, and the hill during the country's modern development phase.
""The gallery features archaeological artefacts excavated from sites within Fort Canning Park and multiple digital interactive stations,"" NParks added.
The gallery was designed in consultation with archaeologists and historians across Singapore.

BICENTENNIAL EXPERIENCE
The final zone of Fort Canning Heritage Gallery will also hold a mini-theatrette.
It will play a film containing repurposed footage from the Singapore Bicentennial centrepiece event in 2019, which was held at the Fort Canning Centre.
Aside from the film - which is titled ""From Singapore to Singaporean: The Bicentennial Experience"" - a full set of the costume worn by actors playing the Malay prince Sang Nila Utama from the Singapore Bicentennial will also be on display.
ENHANCED SPICE GARDEN
The spice garden at Fort Canning Park has been redesigned and expanded to about 3,200 sq m in area, comprising three zones: The previous Spice Garden, Canning Rise and a new Fort Canning Spice Gallery.
It now boasts two water features and enhanced landscaping.
With more than 180 varieties of plants featured, it is Singapore's most diverse spice garden.
The garden includes spices such as gambier and pepper - some of the earliest commercial crops in Singapore, pre-dating the British arrival in the country.
Spice trees such as the nutmeg and clove are also featured. They played an important role as the main commercial spice crops in Singapore in the early 19th century.

SPICE GALLERY
The Spice Gallery optimises the use of existing space by incorporating a former pedestrian ramp and underpass across Canning Rise, NParks said.
""Visitors can learn more about the role that spice trade played in the history of Singapore, the early history of spice plantations here, and the importance of Fort Canning Park in promoting Singapore as a spice trading and producing hub, as it housed Singapore’s first botanical and experimental garden founded in 1822,"" the board added.
Interpretive panels, interactive displays and curated planting feature in the Spice Gallery.
The sheltered underpass contains replicas of a spice provision shop and local kopitiam to teach visitors about the early history of spice plantations in Singapore.
It also includes an indoor gardening setup using grow lights, to showcase the use of technology in gardening.

FORT CANNING BOOK
An NParks-produced book titled ""Fort Canning Park: Heritage & Gardens"" has been launched.
It documents the history and design concept of the park's nine landscaped gardens.
There are also various stories and facts about the park's fauna, heritage monuments and objects, and buildings.
It can be purchased at various locations around the Singapore Botanic Gardens or at the Gardens Shop website.
CHINESE CERAMICS
The third level of the Fort Canning Centre will play host to a new Gallery@L3, a 210 sq m space hosting exhibitions and events, NParks said.
Its first exhibition, a collaboration with the Society for Chinese Ceramics Studies (SCCS), is titled ""Kaleidoscope in Clay (I): Glazes and Forms through 5,000 years of Chinese Ceramics"".
About 140 pieces of Chinese ceramics from the collection of SCCS members will be showcased, including pieces dated to as early as more than 4,000 years ago.
In conjunction with the exhibition, SCCS will also organise a 12-lecture course on the history of Chinese ceramics.
An exhibition preview of selected exhibits will run from Aug 26 to Sep 11, with the full exhibition opening from Oct 7 to Feb 10, 2023. 
A second exhibition titled ""Kaleidoscope in Clay (II)"" will focus on Song and Yuan dynasty ceramics and run from Feb 24, 2023 to Jun 30, 2023.
All exhibitions are open to the public, and admission is free.

EXTENDED OPENING HOURS
The opening of the new Fort Canning Heritage Gallery and the expanded Spice Garden is in conjunction with the Singapore Night Festival.
In view of this, the Fort Canning Heritage Gallery will extend its opening hours till 10pm on Aug 27.
As part of the Festival at the Fort suite of programs, there will be movie screenings, guided tours, game tours and children’s craft activities.
The new facilities at Fort Canning Park are part of NParks' efforts for the second phase of the park's masterplan.
Renovation of existing buildings at the Foothills location within the park has been completed, together with a food and beverage outlet. And enhancements to a playground at Jubilee Park will commence in 2023.
""These enhancements will offer a variety of recreational options to park users, providing spaces for respite and bringing Singaporeans closer to greenery in our city in nature,"" said NParks."
IN FOCUS: A story of how a team poured their heart and soul into enhancing Singapore's water supply and what's next for NEWater,"Twenty years ago, NEWater marked its public debut at the National Day Parade - a feat that would not have been possible if not for a team of engineers and technicians who gave their all. CNA tells their story.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/newater-water-supply-singapore-secure-20th-anniversary-2901301,"SINGAPORE: As familiar tunes of patriotic songs played across the National Stadium on the afternoon of Aug 9, 2002, tens of thousands of people dressed in red and white rose from their seats to toast the country. 
Each was carrying a bottle of NEWater.
Cheering to Singapore's success and its future, more than 60,000 people raised their bottles before taking a swig of the water, which is recycled from used supplies after going through a comprehensive cleaning process.
At home, thousands of viewers took in the scenes as they watched the parade on their television sets.

It was a powerful image and one that would be forever etched in the minds of those who worked tirelessly for years to realise Singapore's ambition of having a sustainable source of water.
But despite the inspiring scenes, the only thing Mr Harry Seah could think about at that moment was how terribly wrong things could go.
""We could not even afford a single mistake because it was all about perception and it was on the national stage,"" said Mr Seah, who led the NEWater project.
Everything he and the team had worked so hard for over the past four years hinged on how the public would respond in the coming days.
Their acceptance was crucial in order for NEWater to be a viable water source.
""There could be people selling food or drinks or some might even bring their food, but all it would take to ruin the perception of NEWater is for 10 people to have food poisoning even if it had nothing to do with the water.""
In the lead-up to the National Day Parade, painstaking efforts were taken to make sure that everything would go smoothly. 
During production, everyone at the plant was on heightened alert to ensure that there were no abnormalities and that the water quality was up to standard. 
Even the bottles that were used to contain the water were of higher quality to ensure perfection.
""We used food-grade plastics for the water because some bottles use plasticisers to make it softer, but we did not want to risk even a very low trace of plasticiser in the NEWater because when you do rigorous testing, it will be detected,"" he said. ""That was the extent we went to in order to ensure quality.""
Other agencies also stepped up to help mitigate potential risks including keeping a close eye on food preparation and packaging.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence secured the bottles of NEWater, making sure they were stored properly before distribution. 
""Every step of the way, we kept our eyes on the water, because our biggest fear was carelessness, and a lot of things could go wrong, so it was a very stressful time,"" recalled the 62-year-old, who is now PUB's deputy chief executive in charge of operations.
Their efforts eventually paid off as the event went off without any major issues, much to the relief of Mr Seah and his team.
""Looking back, it was really the most beautiful part of the whole thing, when the whole stadium saluted the country with NEWater,"" said Mr Seah.

Since then, NEWater has become synonymous with the National Day Parade, with thousands of bottles given out to the audience every year.
Today, NEWater is also an integral part of Singapore's water sustainability plan, and a successful case study for integrated water management internationally.

But more than 20 years ago, the idea of turning the country's used water into clean, drinking water seemed like a far-fetched dream. 
It took blood, sweat and tears for it to become a reality. 
THE MYSTERIOUS PROJECT 
In 1999, a young technician by the name of Peck Cher Hin joined a team of five technicians and engineers from PUB and the then-Ministry of Environment to build an industrial plant. 
But the entire project seemed to be shrouded in mystery, with no one in the team knowing what they were actually building. Despite asking around for months, Mr Peck found that he could never get a clear answer on what the project was about.
As the plant began to take shape, his curiosity only grew.
""When the equipment started coming in, we saw things like pumps - which wasn't at all unusual for a plant - but then we started seeing filtration vessels and columns, and I wondered what this was all about,"" he said.
The final piece of the puzzle was found when he saw the plans for how the pipes were to be connected.
Suddenly, he was filled with doubts about the project.
His team had been tasked to build a demonstration plant that could recycle treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed supplies that were safe for drinking.

""Up until that point, I had never heard of effluent-treated water being able to come out of a tap and be ready for drinking,"" said Mr Peck.
""I was full of doubts about this and even among the team, we were questioning whether it was even possible to make this happen,"" he added, with a laugh.
Unbeknownst to him, there had already been at least two prior studies commissioned by the Singapore Government to study reclaimed water technologies.
The first dated back to the 1970s, which sought to determine the feasibility of producing reclaimed water.
Although the study found it was technically possible, the high cost and unproven reliability of the technology then were insurmountable concerns.

Commentary: Beyond scarcity and security, does Singapore need a new water narrative?













But by the 1990s, the cost and performance of membrane technology had improved considerably. Countries such as the US had also been increasingly using it for water treatment and reclamation.
This led PUB and the then-Ministry of Environment to initiate a study in 1998 to determine if reclaimed water could be a viable option to supplement Singapore's water supply.
As part of this, two engineers from PUB - one of whom was Mr Harry Seah - were sent on a two-week trip to the US to study the full range of water recycling methods, including the use of membrane technology.
But the importance of the study didn't sink in until much later, said Mr Seah.
""I didn't really see the big picture, I just saw the technology that the US was using and thought it looked quite relevant to Singapore but didn't link it to the context of water supply implications at the time,"" said the 62-year-old.
""We saw that the technology, through years of testing, had been brought to a stage where we could revisit it again, and so my recommendation was basically to explore it.""
The findings were so significant that his technical report was read and processed with action taken in less than a week - highly unusual by public service standards, he said.
This eventually led him to put together a team - the one that Mr Peck was a part of - that would build the country's first full-scale demonstration plant.
A LEAP OF FAITH
Getting the plant up and running was anything but smooth sailing.
While the facilities in the US were mostly pilot plants with a small output, Singapore was looking to pull this off on a much larger scale, by producing 2 million gallons of clean water a day.
""We decided that there was no point in repeating what the US was already doing, so we took a leap of faith because at the time we had no experience in designing or operating or even maintaining the plant,"" he said.
For the first few months, problems seemed to appear at every turn, leading to worries that the project would fail.
The plant's membranes - or filters - kept on fouling, which is a process that occurs when there's a build-up of particles on its surface. This restricted the flow of liquids through its pores, affecting water quality and the efficiency of the filtration system.






      Today, these membranes work efficiently to filter out undesirable contaminants including viruses but  back in 2000, when the demonstration plant first opened, engineers and technicians could not figure out why they kept fouling. (Photo: CNA/Vanessa Lim)
    






As a result, the plant was unstable, creating issues with costs and reliability. 
Recalling the early days of the project, he said his team would often end up working through the night, racing to get the plant up and running.
""In those days, the plant was like my first home, I would only go home for dinner and then run back to the plant,"" he said.
Problems continued to plague the plant even after it officially opened in May 2000.
""It was three months of hell because it seemed like everything we did was wrong, and everyone was just working day and night, like there was no tomorrow, to fix the problems.""
For Mr Peck, whose son had just been born, it also meant having to juggle being a new parent and operating a plant at the same time.
But despite the challenges, the team never gave up and instead, drew strength from one another.
""I didn't have to justify or persuade people that it was an important project, it just came naturally,"" said Mr Seah.
Noting the amount of personal sacrifices involved, he expressed great appreciation for those who gave it their all.
""They had to sacrifice time with their children, their family, and even their social life, because sometimes they had to work until 2 or 3am. These were all the sacrifices they made,"" he said.
""They could have easily not done this and treated the project like routine work but they knew that the work they were doing was not routine.
""That was the beauty about this project - everyone including industry consultants and suppliers from the private sector was on the same page.""
Then, in August 2000 - three months after the plant opened - the team made a major breakthrough.
""We realised the key issue … The membranes at the plant were only being disinfected intermittently out of fear that regular cleaning might end up damaging them,"" said Mr Seah.
In the end, all it took to solve the problem was to go back to the basics.
""We did simple lab tests - no different from the ones you do in school - where you do a simple titration to see what is the point where, based on dosage, (the membrane would be damaged),"" said Mr Seah.
""We realised that there was no way that we could get to that (point) because our dosing was too low,"" he said.
""So we assessed that those fears were unwarranted and started regularly disinfecting the membranes.""
Their assessment proved to be correct as the plant started to stabilize.
""Water was coming in and going out (in a continuous flow), and when we looked at our screens to see the performance of the plant, it was a very nice straight line,"" said Mr Seah.
""That was when we knew that we had more or less got it.""
FIRST DROP OF SUCCESS
Although tests showed that the reclaimed water was well within global drinking standards and safe, there were still some - including Mr Peck - who were sceptical about whether the technology really worked.
But the moment they saw, tasted and touched the water - all doubts were thrown out of the window. 
Recalling that moment, Mr Peck said everyone, including Mr Seah and contractors of the project, had gathered at the plant for the testing.
As the factory hummed, they held their breath in excitement as the water started flowing through the pipes.
""We would move with the water as it passed through different stages, and when we finally came to the last stage, someone opened the tap and said this is the water,"" said Mr Peck.
What came out was crystal-clear water, much to the delight - and relief - of everyone at the plant. 






      When he saw how clear the water was, Mr Peck said he couldn't believe his eyes and was filled with joy. (Photo: CNA/Vanessa Lim)
    






""We were so happy. All of us drank the water and even played with it, splashing the water at each other,"" he said, chuckling at the memory.
""I actually couldn't tell the difference between the water and tap water - now I can taste a slight difference but if you had asked me at that time, I wouldn't have known if no one told me.""
For Mr Seah, that moment would be etched in his memory forever.
""It was very emotional and satisfying because (up until that point) we had been hitting the wall. My people had worked so very hard because everyone saw the importance of the project and that by hook or by crook, we would have to get it working,"" said Mr Seah, as his eyes welled up with tears.
""When we finally got it, I think we were all relieved because it meant that we had done our job,"" he said.

With the water tried and tested, it was time to give it a name but even this had to be carefully considered.
""The word reclaimed or recycled sounded negative at the time, so there were discussions about coming up with something more positive and could inspire hope,"" said Mr Seah.
""So we thought about what the technology actually offers us by cleaning or purifying the water and someone said it gives the water a new lease of life which is how we came up with 'new water'.""
""But new water is two words ... buay swee (Hokkien for doesn't look nice) so we decided to join the two words together using one 'W'. Then came the discussion about whether the 'W' should be in uppercase or lowercase.""
""If you put the 'W' in lowercase, it reads as 'NE-water', which means no water,"" he laughed.
And that was how NEWater was born.

CHALLENGES AHEAD
Today, public acceptance for NEWater remains high. A survey conducted in 2002 found that most people would drink it directly or if it was mixed with reservoir water.
Earlier this year, PUB and Brewerkz announced that a craft beer made with NEWater would go on public sale for the first time.

Owner and director of Brewerkz Tan Wee Tuck told CNA the response has been positive so far, with the beer almost sold out in selected supermarkets across Singapore.
""Having been around for so long, NEWater is already more or less accepted here so we weren't too concerned about public acceptance,"" said Mr Tan.
""But what was surprising was the international reaction because people are not familiar with NEWater, which is recycled water. So for them, there was a shock factor. But (the response) was still quite positive.






      Since April, NEWBrew has been sold at around 80 supermarkets including Cold Storage and Fairprice Finest outlets. (Photo: PUB)
    






The past two decades have also seen much progress in the country's production of NEWater. 
To date, Singapore has five NEWater plants in Bedok, Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Changi with a combined capacity of around 170 million gallons a day. 
This can meet up to about 40 per cent of the country's current water demand of 430 million gallons a day.
Water produced by these plants is used mainly for industrial purposes, such as cooling at wafer fabrication plants, industrial estates and commercial buildings.

During dry periods, NEWater is added to reservoirs to blend with raw water, before being treated at the waterworks so that it can be supplied to consumers as tap water.
However, in the face of climate change which is expected to exacerbate global water insecurity, water continues to be an existential issue for land-scarce Singapore. 
An existing agreement that was signed in 1962, entitling Singapore to draw and use 250 million gallons of raw water a day from the Johor river, will expire in 2061.

To ensure a sustainable water supply, efforts are currently under way to improve the efficiency and capacity of NEWater production. 
Two upcoming NEWater plants in Changi and Tuas, which are expected to be ready by 2025 and 2026 respectively, will add 75 million gallons of NEWater per day.
Both will use a more efficient reverse osmosis technology that can recover and recycle up to 90 per cent of used water to produce clean water. 
This is higher than the recovery rate at existing plants which hovers between 75 and 80 per cent.
""We have a runway (to improve our processes) so we need to look for new ideas and technologies to drive down the energy requirements because in Singapore, we have limited resources, so we need to think about sustainability,"" said Mr Seah.

HANDING OVER THE REINS
At the Bedok NEWater factory, where he has worked for the last 18 years, Mr Peck sits across from this journalist in the conference room, a look of contentment on his face.
""I always say that this is my second national service because as a Singaporean, I'm contributing to Singapore,"" he said.
""To be able to work on this project, makes me feel very proud because every day, I find meaning in my work.""
What made the project all the more special was the people he had worked with, he said. 
""We worked very closely and were like friends, where we would share knowledge with each other, or teach and learn together,"" he said.
""It made us, all the people who worked on the demonstration plant, like a very big family and we're still close even till today.""
The 52-year-old senior engineer has also started passing down his knowledge to the younger generation of engineers and technicians by conducting training at PUB's Singapore Water Academy 
""I hope that whatever we are doing now, the new generation will take over from there and do it even better, and show the world that Singapore can do it,"" said Mr Peck.
Across town, Mr Seah sits in his office at the Environment Building quietly reflecting on the past 24 years. 
""Would I have done anything differently? Probably not much because I think we got it right,"" he said. 
""If we were to turn back the clock and do something a bit more extreme (like making NEWater available for direct potable use), the project might fail, because the public's fear and concerns are real things, (and so) we have to convince them,"" he said. 
""The first three months we had a lot of problems, but it was a time where we learned a lot of things. If it had gone smoothly, I don't think we would have learnt anything.
""So much so that today, the operation and maintenance of NEWater is line work, or routine work.
""My job is to make it boring, because boring means no problem,"" he said, laughing. 
As we continue our chat, a glint of light suddenly catches my attention. 
Turning towards the window, I spotted a plastic bottle of water with the words ""NEWater Jan 01"" scrawled in white ink.

Curious, I inspected the bottle more closely and noticed that it had not been opened yet. 
""One of the old-timers who had worked very closely with me on NEWater gave it to me before he retired one to two years ago, because he knew how attached to NEWater I am,"" explained Mr Seah. 
""He had kept the water all these years back from 2001.""
""What are you planning to do with it?"" I asked. 
""I'm keeping it!"" he said, with a laugh.
""When I retire, I'll pass it to somebody else.""

",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/forward-singapore-exercise-lawrence-wong-nus-forum-youth-active-citizens-shaping-future-2902541,"SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Aug 26) urged youths to be active citizens in shaping Singapore's future.
Speaking at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum, Mr Wong stressed the importance of the Forward Singapore exercise as an effort to refresh and strengthen Singapore's social compact.
Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, launched the exercise in June. It is led by him and the fourth generation, or 4G leadership team.
""Some questions to pose to all of you are the following: How can we continue to provide more opportunities for every Singaporean? How can we keep Singapore cohesive and inclusive as we move forward together?"" he added.
""And of course, finally, what change would you like to see in Singapore and what can you do to help make that a reality? Don't just ask for changes and say it's somebody else's business to get that thing done,"" said Mr Wong, posing these questions to students in the auditorium. 
""What would you like to see, and how can you be involved as an active citizen in shaping Singapore's future too?""
Singapore has inherited a ""stable, prosperous, united"" country from its forefathers, he added.
""We should cherish that. We should be very appreciative that we have this wonderful gift given to us, (that) we are in this environment here,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.
""But we should never take that for granted. I think it's our collective responsibility to see how we can improve it and make it better.""

INCOME INEQUALITY AND SUPPORTING VULNERABLE GROUPS
In his speech, Mr Wong addressed income inequality in Singapore and the importance of uplifting lower-income households.
Income inequality in Singapore, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has been coming down, he noted.
""It's because of all our efforts to uplift incomes at the lower end, and make sure that lower-income households enjoy good income growth. And that's very important for Singapore's cohesion, that everyone continues to have this chance of moving forward together,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.
""How do we sustain this, is the question?""
Even as Singapore continues to grow as a global city, the country must ensure that everyone ""progresses and moves forward together"", he added.
""One important strategy is to make sure that we continue to have a fair and progressive tax and transfer system,"" he continued.
The Government will continue to maintain a progressive system that is fair, and ""will tilt in favour"" of the vulnerable and lower-income groups in Singapore.
These families need support from agencies, as well as interventions and solutions to help them overcome the obstacles that they face in life, said Mr Wong.
""This is extremely resource intensive,"" he said, adding that each family needs social workers, counsellors and other people coming together to help them.
""And this is why it's also very important for us to understand that making this work, it's not going to be possible just through the Government's efforts alone,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.
""Because in order to enable these sorts of solutions, we need everyone to come alongside. (We need) everyone to do their part."""

"S$555,000 worth of drugs, airsoft gun seized in CNB raids","A total of 134 suspected drug offenders were also arrested.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/s555-000-drugs-airsoft-gun-cnb-raids-cannabis-cd-case-2901976,"SINGAPORE: Drugs with an estimated street value of about S$555,000 were seized following a two-week islandwide operation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).
The series of raids, which ended on Friday (Aug 26), netted about 3,730g of heroin, 866g of Ice, 5,240g of cannabis, 51 ecstasy tablets and 2g of ketamine.
CNB also confiscated 21g of new psychoactive substances (NPS), 108 Erimin-5 tablets, 29 Yaba tablets, a bottle of methadone and four bottles of liquid suspected to contain gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).
A total of 134 suspected drug offenders were also arrested, said CNB, adding that some of the areas covered during the operation included Bukit Batok, Kallang and Sengkang.
THROWN OUT OF WINDOW
In one of the cases, CNB officers raided a residential unit near Chai Chee Avenue on Aug 23.
Two Singaporean men, aged 58 and 59, were arrested. A small amount of heroin and a bottle of methadone were seized from the unit, as well as various drug paraphernalia, said CNB.
“Prior to the arrest, suspected controlled drugs were believed to have been thrown out of the unit’s window,” the agency added.
Photos taken by CNB showed several officers retrieving the suspected controlled drugs from a construction hoarding.
They later recovered the substances, which included three packets and straws containing about 13g of heroin.

"High Court dismisses ex-bus captain’s lawsuit against SBS Transit on rostering, pay practices","Mr Chua Qwong Meng's lawsuit was a test case linked to 12 other bus captains making similar claims against SBS Transit.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sbs-transit-lawsuit-bus-captain-dismissed-roster-rest-day-pay-2902071,"SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Friday (Aug 26) dismissed a lawsuit filed by a former bus captain that alleged unfair rostering and pay practices by SBS Transit.
Mr Chua Qwong Meng’s lawsuit was a test case linked to 12 other bus captains making similar claims against the public transport provider.
Justice Audrey Lim allowed the case to be heard in the High Court after finding that it raised important questions of law affecting a large class of employees.
Mr Chua, who is represented by lawyer Lim Tean, worked for SBS Transit from 2017 to 2020. His suit alleged several breaches of his employment contract and the Employment Act.
He claimed that SBS forced him to work seven consecutive days before giving him a rest day, forced him to work overtime, and gave insufficient break times.
He also alleged that he was underpaid for working overtime and on a public holiday, among other claims.

SBS Transit lawsuit: Ex-bus driver testifies about work hours, rostering system on first day of High Court trial













In dismissing all of the plaintiff’s claims, Justice Lim relied on work calendar reports generated by SBS’ rostering and scheduling system to reach her findings.
Mr Chua disputed the authenticity of the reports at trial, but the judge accepted SBS’ evidence as proof that the reports were authentic.
The judge noted testimony from SBS CEO Cheng Siak Kian that the rostering system was “a gold standard for bus operators worldwide”.
The system issued notifications if there was an attempt to roster a bus captain without a rest day in a week, according to the testimony.
REST DAYS
The Employment Act states that “every employee must be allowed in each week a rest day without pay of one whole day”.
Mr Chua claimed that this meant he was entitled to a rest day on the seventh day of each week after working for six days.
He argued that otherwise, the provision could be abused by rostering workers’ rest days to fall on the first day and last day of a two-week period. This meant working for 12 consecutive days in between.
Justice Lim disagreed, finding that an employer is allowed to schedule a rest day on any day of the week, defined as “a continuous period of seven days”.
She found there was no evidence that SBS had rostered Mr Chua to work more than 12 days in between two rest days.
Mr Chua also claimed that he was compelled to work on his rest days “all the time” and given disciplinary notices if he refused.
The judge dismissed these as bare assertions unsupported by independent evidence.
OVERTIME AND BREAK TIMES
The Employment Act states that an employee who is required to work more than eight hours a day or more than 44 hours a week must be paid overtime.
Mr Chua’s contractual hours as an SBS bus captain amounted to 48 hours a week. He argued this meant that he was obliged to work overtime to earn his basic pay.
But SBS, represented by a team of lawyers from Davinder Singh Chambers, countered that the contractual 48 hours were gross hours that included break times of at least 45 minutes a day.
Excluding break times, this meant that Mr Chua would have qualified for his basic pay after working 43-and-a-half or fewer hours a week, they argued.
Justice Lim therefore found that the arrangement did not breach the Employment Act.
She also found that the rate of pay for the overtime hours that Mr Chua did work followed that in a collective agreement between SBS and the National Transport Workers’ Union, and was higher than the minimum rate in the Employment Act.
Mr Chua also claimed that SBS gave him fewer than 45 minutes of break time in his first eight hours of work, which is required under the Employment Act.
He said he was given break periods of 25 minutes and a toilet break period of about 10 minutes, which was “mere idealism” as the timings did not factor in traffic or parking delays.
Justice Lim considered whether the 45 minutes of break time must be given continuously, and whether Mr Chua had “an opportunity to have a meal” as specified in the Employment Act.
She found that employers can give multiple break times that add up to no less than 45 minutes, and that SBS allocated Mr Chua sufficient time to have meals.
The judge said she would hear the parties on costs at the next hearing."
Aubeck Kam to be appointed permanent secretary at MHA,"Mr Kam will also continue in his role as Permanent Secretary (Social and Family Development).

Five on Friday: 5 movies that were re-edited for not making the cut,"In CNA's regular look at what hit the headlines during the week, Five on Friday looks at five movies that were re-edited (more than once for some) after their release.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/5-movies-re-edited-release-blade-runner-lilo-stitch-incredibles-2899386,"SINGAPORE: Remember the times when you frantically try to delete a message on WhatsApp because you need to retract something you said? 
How about when you’ve published a Facebook post and realised there's a grammatical error? 
All it takes are a few clicks on the ""Edit"" or ""Delete"" buttons and chances are, the reader is none the wiser.
But what if you’ve released a movie and you want or need to change it? Sounds impossible?
Apparently, no.
Recently, filmgoers in China were treated to a different version of the latest movie in the Despicable Me franchise, Minions: The Rise of Gru, several weeks after the film was released in cinemas in the United States.
Unlike the international version, the film that was screened in China saw an alternative ending in which the good guys win.
A series of subtitled still images inserted into the credits sequence on mainland Chinese screens reassures the audience that police catch Gru's law-breaking mentor Wild Knuckles and lock him up for 20 years after a failed heist.
Meanwhile, Gru ""eventually became one of the good guys"", devoted to raising his family, the Chinese ending said.
Yet, this is not the first time such edits have happened. Here are five other movies that were re-edited after their release:
BLADE RUNNER
















When I say Blade Runner, which movie do you think of? The one released in 2017 starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford or the original 1982 version with Ford?
For fans of the original, do you know how many different versions the 1982 movie had?
At least five.
The very first release of the sci-fi classic, known as the theatrical cut, had studio-mandated voiceovers and a happier ending which director Ridley Scott did not want.
Then came the international cut released for audiences worldwide which was gorier and more violent.
There was also what was called the workprint, referring to a rough cut of the film, discovered by a film preservationist in 1989.
The discovery of the workprint is said to have triggered the idea of releasing new and more definitive versions of Blade Runner for the public.
Hence in 1992, a new version - the director’s cut - was released and both the voiceover and happy ending were dropped. While it was called the director’s cut, Scott did not actually supervise the film as he was working on another project and so he was not totally satisfied with the outcome.
For the 25th anniversary release of Blade Runner in 2007, Scott wanted a true director’s cut to be released into the world and so he did just that and called it the final cut.
No voiceover, no happy ending, no problem (for Scott at least).
Five versions of the film have been put together into a Blade Runner ultimate collector’s edition so for all of you avid fans, here’s how it looks.

ALADDIN






      Screengrab from the song Arabian nights featured in Aladdin. (Screenshot: YouTube/Prince & Princess)
    






Aladdin – a movie we know and a movie we love. At least I do, especially the animated version released in 1992.
A big part of the movie’s success, besides late actor Robin Williams' portrayal of the Genie, is the music. A Whole New World was my anthem growing up.
It’s no surprise that the Disney movie went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.
Yet, one particular song did find itself in the midst of a controversy. 
The opening song Arabian Nights originally featured lines such as ""Where they cut off your ear/If they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home”.
Arab-American Anti-Discrimination groups demanded the line be changed because of its portrayal of Arabic people as violent barbarians.
The lyrics were changed in July 1993 to ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense. It's barbaric, but hey, it's home"", with the change first appearing on the video release in the same year.
Some groups still weren’t too fond of the use of the word “barbaric” and strove to have it altered, but Disney refused.
“Barbaric refers to the land and the heat and not to the people,” Disney distribution president Dick Cook explained to the LA Times in 1993.





LILO AND STITCH

Die-hard fans of the animated movie Lilo and Stitch were not too pleased when they realised the version of the movie on streaming service Disney+ had been edited.
In the theatrical version, a character called Cobra Bubbles, a former CIA agent-turned-social worker, stops by to check on the titular character Lilo and her sister Nani's house.
In the scene after he leaves, Nani gets angry at Lilo for making a bad impression and chases her around the house until they end up in the laundry room. In the original version of the movie, Lilo jumps into a dryer to hide.
But in the Disney+ version, Lilo does not hide in a dryer. Instead, she is in a furniture of some kind, behind a pizza box.
The executive decision to edit the scene was done so that children will not follow Lilo's footsteps and try to hide in a dryer, which could be potentially dangerous.
I see where the safety concerns are coming from. On the other hand, I’m also impressed that some eagle-eyed fans were able to spot the difference. I definitely would not have picked up on it.

I don’t know about you but I for one would not be able to sit through a five-hour movie.
Heaven’s Gate, a 1980 Western epic film by the late director Michael Cimino, lasted for five hours and 25 minutes when its first cut was shown to the studio.
The studio refused to release a movie that long so Cimino went on to cut out a chunk of the film. The version that was screened at a premiere ran three hours and 39 minutes.
But things still did not work out as the film ended up receiving an overwhelmingly negative reception which eventually led to it being pulled from cinemas.
Cimino re-edited the film to two hours and 29 minutes and released it in April 1981, the only version that screened in wide release.
Despite all this, the film still remained a financial failure and was declared a disaster then. Interestingly, over the years, opinions on the movie have shifted, with some calling it a masterpiece.
INCREDIBLES 2
















Light-sensitive viewers took issue with the first release of the 2018 sequel to the Incredibles. 
The Disney and Pixar movie had set the record for best debut for animated film and it became the fourth-highest grossing film of the year.
But the movie was re-edited to pass what is called the Harding Box Test, which is used to look at video footage for flashing lights and patterns that may trigger a seizure in people with photosensitive epilepsy.
This came after concerns when the film first aired in the US that some scenes could cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.
The villain in the movie, known as The Screenslaver, uses hypnotic flashing videos to put people in a trance and the repeated light flashes could be problematic for light-sensitive viewers, argued some viewers.
A viral Twitter thread soon made its rounds, warning viewers of the flashing lights and some cinemas put up signs to inform the audience.
Eventually, Disney re-edited the film to comply with the Harding Box test, with the altered version having reduced flashing images.

Last 4 of 11 trainee lawyers who cheated in Bar exams withdraw applications to practise law ,"The four trainee lawyers were banned from bringing fresh applications for a period of between nine months and three years. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/4-trainee-lawyers-cheated-exams-withdraw-application-practise-law-2899931,"SINGAPORE: The last four of the 11 trainee lawyers who cheated in the 2020 Bar examinations withdrew their applications to practise law on Friday (Aug 26). 
The four are: Mr Sean Wong Wai Loong, Ms Joleen Ong Jia Yi, Mr Lim Zi Yi, and Ms Annabelle Au Jia En. They had cheated in the Part B 2020 Bar examinations that law graduates must pass in order to practise law, which were held online that year. 
Mr Wong had copied a fellow candidate's answer without her knowledge, while Mr Lim and Ms Au had provided answers to Ms Ong, who had requested them.
After they were caught, all four retook and passed the examinations. They filed applications to be admitted to the Bar but withdrew them after objections were entered.
Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who heard and granted the applications in the High Court, ordered that the four not bring a fresh application for admission to the Bar for a duration of between nine months and three years. The period was meant for the rehabilitation of the applicants, rather than to punish them. 
Ms Ong's duration is three years, Mr Wong's two years, Mr Lim's one year and Ms Au's is nine months.  
Additionally, the four will have to satisfy any further requirements imposed by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), Law Society and the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE).
Noting that the four may return with fresh applications in the future, Chief Justice Menon said: ""Before then, (Mr Wong and Ms Ong) will need to learn, above all, that there is far greater honour and dignity in accepting rightful failure than in grasping for undeserved success.
""The (other) two must learn not to go to the aid of others, no matter how familiar, how close, or how perceivably sympathetic the cry for help might be, if such aid can only be provided in sacrifice of one’s integrity and principles.""
Chief Justice Menon had earlier heard and granted the same to the first trainee lawyer, Mr Leon Tay Quan Li, who had decided to withdraw his application in May. Mr Tay was barred from reapplying to the Singapore Bar or other jurisdictions for five years. 
Six others - Ms Monisha Devaraj, Mr Kushal Atul Shah, Mr Sreeraam Ravenderan, Mr Matthew Chow Jun Feng, Mr Lionel Wong Choong Yoong and Ms Lynn Kuek Yi Ting - followed suit in withdrawing their applications on Aug 15. This was granted by Justice Choo Han Teck, who did not set a time for them to reapply. 
The six had also cheated during the 2020 Part B exams. Five had communicated with each other and shared answers in six of the papers, including one for “Ethics and professional responsibility”, through WhatsApp.
The sixth, Ms Kuek, had colluded with another candidate to cheat on three papers.

In April, Justice Choo adjourned the Bar admission hearing of Ms Kuek for a year, and the hearings of the other five for six months.
Justice Choo had initially redacted the identities of the six trainees to prevent them from being prejudiced in the long run, but revealed their names after sharp public interest in the matter. 
That same month, the Attorney-General said that five more trainees were found to have cheated in the 2020 qualifying exams, bringing the total number of people involved to 11.
These five include the four who withdrew their applications today.
THE CHEATING INCIDENTS
Details of the cheating incidents emerged during Friday's hearing, which spanned four hours and involved representatives from the AGC, SILE and the Law Society. 
Mr Wong had sat for an exam about mediation on Nov 25, 2020. After submitting his paper online, Mr Wong exchanged his script with another candidate and realised that he failed to answer a question that carried almost one-third of the total marks.
Panicking, Mr Wong copied his unwitting fellow candidate's answer into his script before resubmitting his edited script. 
SILE discovered the similarities and interviewed Mr Wong, who was quick to admit his wrongdoing. However, he failed to disclose his misconduct in his Bar application, claiming that he was ""frightened"" by the prospect of his legal life ending and ""could not find the courage"" to mention the cheating. 
On this, Chief Justice said that Mr Wong had shown a ""cynical disregard"" for doing the right thing and his actions had shown ""serious defects in character"".
Ms Ong, the trainee who had received the longest duration, had been in the same study group as Ms Au and Mr Lim. 
During the exam about mediation on Nov 25 2020, Ms Ong approached Mr Lim online and requested the answer to a question she was unable to complete. He obliged and Ms Ong copied the entire response into her own script. 
During the ""Ethics and professional responsibility"" paper, Ms Ong asked both Ms Au and Mr Lim for answers. She claimed that she had panicked after the paper was delayed due to technical difficulties. Not knowing that the exam had been extended by 15 minutes, she asked the pair for answers which she then copied and submitted as her own. 
Chief Justice Menon considered Ms Ong's conduct more serious than Ms Au's and Mr Lim's as she was the instigator. Moreover, she had cheated for her own benefit, while the other two had only helped her to cheat. 
Ms Ong had also failed to come clean and volunteer information the first time she was interviewed by SILE, while Mr Lim and Ms Au had been forthright. Mr Lim had in fact volunteered information about the mediation exam even though he had not been asked about it. Chief Justice Menon saw this as an ""encouraging sign"".
The Chief Justice was also ""heartened"" that senior members of the Bar had stepped forth to act as mentors to the applicants. 
Amongst them was Mr Wong's lawyer, Mr Goh Peck San, who asked for Mr Wong to be barred for between one to one-and-a-half years. 
""I have known Sean for a long time ... my observation is that he is a person of good character. He has made a mistake this time and he has no excuse for it but ... he has shown keen interest to practice ... to be a member of the practising Bar, I'm just asking for leniency on this,"" said Mr Goh. 
Ms Ong was represented by lawyer Naidu Devadas, Mr Lim by lawyer Shobna Chandran and Ms Au by lawyer Peter Ong."
CNA Explains: Should you wear a mask on a plane if it's optional?,"Will wearing a mask prevent you from catching COVID-19 on a flight? If you've recently recovered, does that mean you are safe and shouldn't need to wear a mask? Infectious diseases experts explain. 
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mask-plane-flight-optional-prevent-covid-2900476,"SINGAPORE: From Monday (Aug 29), Singapore will no longer require masks to be worn except on public transport and in healthcare settings. 
While masks are required on transport modes like the MRT and public buses, they are optional on private transport such as taxis and private bus services.
They are also not necessary at the airport, and may not even be required on flights. 
But should you still opt to wear a mask on a plane even if you don't have to? CNA asks some public health experts.
First off, which flights can you go on without a mask?
If the country you are travelling to or arriving from has a mask mandate, you'll have to wear one on the flight.
""Where there is a mandatory requirement for masks to be worn ... the mask must be worn on the flight itself,"" said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Wednesday. 
According to Singapore Airlines (SIA), some destinations which require passengers aged six and above to wear a mask on a flight are: Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Cambodia, mainland China and Canada.
But many other destinations do not require masks on planes. These include Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand, Maldives, the US and UK.
SIA said it will match its internal policy with the Singapore Government's. The airline will no longer require passengers to wear face masks from Aug 29, unless mandated by the place that the flight is travelling to or from.
Jetstar also said that it will ensure its mask policy ""continues to be aligned with the relevant authorities"" of the destinations it flies to.

How safe is flying without a mask? 
Although masks are optional on some flights, should you still wear one? Infectious diseases experts noted that ventilation standards for planes are high, and that there have been no major COVID-19 clusters originating from flights. 
“Travelling in commercial aircraft is much safer than people think,” said Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases. 
The air in a plane is changed over every three minutes, he said. About 60 per cent of the air entering the cabin is completely fresh and from outside, while the other 40 per cent is passed through hospital-grade HEPA, or high-efficiency particulate air filters, which remove 99.97 per cent of airborne particles. 
“This is why there have been no major clusters on planes. It is almost impossible for COVID particles to be wafting through a plane. So I think it is reasonable to not wear a mask – unless of course you have a respiratory infection,” said Prof Fisher. 
Travellers also remove their masks when eating and drinking on the plane, he noted. 
By not wearing a mask throughout the flight and taking them off sometimes, they would be exposing themselves to those around them during those periods, said Prof Fisher, who is also Professor of Medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.
Another infectious diseases expert, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, said the HEPA filters are ""as good as it gets"".
But Dr Leong, who runs a private practice at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said transmission could still occur ""three rows in front of and behind your seat"".
“Given that passengers in coach are packed close together, this doesn't give much comfort. Business class and first-class patients will be exposed as well. All you need is one patient,” he told CNA. 
To avoid falling sick while on holiday, he advised travellers to continue wearing a mask on flights even if it is optional.
Who should wear a mask while on a flight?
Different individuals are at different levels of risk if they catch COVID-19, and this may influence their decision to wear a mask on a flight, experts said. 
For example, those who are younger or who have recovered recently from COVID-19 “may brave it”, said Dr Leong. 
However, some reports indicate that people could catch COVID-19 again as early as 17 days after a prior infection, he said. 
Those who are more vulnerable might choose to wear a mask if their immunity is poor, Dr Leong said. This could include transplant patients who are on various immunosuppressive drugs, cancer survivors, or if they are returning home to family members who are at higher risk. 
Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, advocated that travellers should do ""whatever they are comfortable with"".
“For people who are immunocompromised or who have not been infected before, it would probably be a good idea to wear a mask through the flight although this may be uncomfortable,” he added. 
“For those who are quadruple vaccinated and previously infected, the risks of severe disease are really low, so this is up to them.”

Prof Fisher agreed that vaccinated people are at very low risk of severe disease.
If someone seated nearby has symptoms, travellers could opt to wear a mask, he added. It would also be ideal if the cabin crew could ask passengers with symptoms to wear a mask. 
“As a matter of course, it would be reasonable to encourage mask wearing when you can't distance and you are very vulnerable. But that is not because they are on a plane,” said Prof Fisher, stressing again that the ventilation on commercial planes is superior “to almost any other setting”. 
What other precautions should you take?
Basic hygiene on the flight is important, said Prof Tambyah.
A study on H1N1 during a long-haul flight in 2009 also showed that sleeping through the flight was protective, he said.
“Personally, I think that climbing over someone to get to the toilet or the snack bar is a high-risk activity,” he added. ""Having said that, not moving around on a plane puts one at risk of a deep vein thrombosis ('economy class syndrome') so we have to make some choices.""
Dr Leong recommended that travellers wear a KN94, KN95 or N95 mask throughout their flights. 
They could also eat their meals before or after everyone else, and wipe down their chairs and tray tables with disposable, single-use alcohol wipes, he said. 
Many travellers also take their masks off in the toilet to breathe better, said Dr Leong. 
“But this may be their own undoing. The previous user could have left a ton of virus in the cubicle waiting for you.”

1.2 million Singaporean households to get S$100 utilities credit by September,"Singaporean households living in both public and private residential properties are eligible for the utilities credit.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singaporean-household-utilities-credit-one-september-mof-2901371,"SINGAPORE: About 1.2 million Singaporean households will receive a one-off S$100 household utilities credit by next month.
The payout, which will be given to households in both public and private residential properties, is part of a S$1.5 billion package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in June to help Singaporeans cope with higher inflation.
All households with at least one Singapore citizen and living in a residential property in Singapore are eligible for the credit.
The utilities credit is on top of the permanent GST Voucher U-Save scheme which benefits about 950,000 HDB households, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in a press release on Friday (Aug 26).
Households that are eligible for GST Voucher U-Save will also receive the utilities credit, said MOF.
The payout will be directly disbursed to eligible households’ SP Service utilities accounts by September.
It can be used to offset SP Group charges. Households which are billed separately for their electricity charges by electricity retailers can use the credit for their other non-electricity SP Group charges, such as water, gas and refuse disposal.
Excess credit on the SP Group account will be rolled over to offset future utilities bills, until it is fully used.
HDB households will receive double their regular U-Save this financial year through the regular GSTV scheme and Household Support Package announced at Budget 2022.
The Household Support Package worth S$560 million is aimed at helping Singaporeans with utility bills, children’s education and daily essentials.
In all, households in four-room HDB flats will receive rebates equivalent to about five months of their utilities bills for this financial year.
Those living in three-room HDB flats will receive about seven months’ worth of rebates.

The permanent GSTV scheme, introduced in 2012, helps lower- and middle-income households offset part of their utilities bill and lower their household expenses.
In June, DPM Wong, who is also Finance Minister, announced that about 1.5 million Singaporeans will receive up to S$300 cash in a special GST Voucher payment this month.
He also added that all Singaporean households will receive S$100 utilities credit to help offset their bills."
3 men arrested for evading roadblock at Nicoll Highway and dangerous driving,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/men-arrested-evade-roadblock-dangerous-driving-nicoll-highway-police-2901271,"SINGAPORE: Three men, aged between 38 and 44, were arrested for evading a roadblock and dangerous driving, said the police in a news release on Friday (Aug 26).
The incident took place on Monday at 3.25am. Police said they were conducting a roadblock along Nicoll Highway towards Mountbatten Road, when three vehicles made a three-point turn before the roadblock and drove against traffic flow.
“The officers immediately initiated a pursuit and managed to intercept one of the vehicles along Syed Alwi Road,” said the police.
A 44-year-old male driver was arrested for dangerous driving and evading the roadblock.
""Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from police cameras and CCTVs (closed-circuit television), officers from Central Police Division and traffic police established the identities of the other two drivers,” said the police.
The two men, aged 38 and 44, were arrested on Monday and Tuesday respectively.
The three vehicles were seized, said the police, adding that investigations are ongoing.
Any person found guilty of evading a roadblock may be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to seven years, or both.
The offence of dangerous driving carries a jail term of up to 12 months, or with a fine up to S$5,000, or both.
Roadblocks are conducted to deter and detect crimes, said the police. Members of public are advised to cooperate with police officers when approached during roadblocks, they added."
Tradenation luxury goods scam: Couple remanded in prison as investigations continue,"Pi Jiapeng and his wife Siriwipa Pansuk remain on remand as the judge notes investigations are likely to be ""protracted"".
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tradenation-luxury-goods-scam-pi-jiapeng-siriwipa-pansuk-2901061,"SINGAPORE: The couple allegedly at the centre of a multi-million-dollar luxury goods scam on Friday (Aug 16) were ordered to remain on remand as investigations into the case continue.
Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his wife, Thai national Siriwipa Pansuk, are accused of deceiving Tradenation customers into paying for luxury watches they did not intend to deliver.
The couple, both 27, also allegedly cheated customers of their other luxury goods firm Tradeluxury into buying luxury handbags.
The alleged offences took place between May 28, 2021 and Jun 27 this year, according to court documents. Victims reported losses of more than S$20 million.
The couple appeared in court via video link from prison, wearing red polo shirts.
Both have been on remand to assist with investigations. The prosecution previously described the case as ""complex"" and said more time was needed to determine the whereabouts of the money.
On Friday, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh said that Pi and Pansuk no longer had to be remanded in a specific prison division to assist with investigations.
However, both will remain on remand in prison as a judge previously ordered that they were not to be offered bail given the flight risk.
The couple face charges of illegally leaving Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4, after Pi had been arrested and while Pansuk was assisting with investigations.
They were on the run for about five weeks before being arrested in Malaysia and handed over to Singapore police on Aug 11.
Mr Koh on Friday also requested an adjournment of six weeks as investigations are still ongoing.
The judge noted that the prosecution previously indicated that investigations were likely to be ""protracted"" given the number of allegations.
The prosecution had described the cheating charges against Pi and Pansuk as ""holding charges"", adding that investigations were still at an early stage.
Pi and Pansuk will return to court in October for a pre-trial conference, an administrative hearing where the prosecution and defence meet a judge to manage the progress of the case.
Pi is represented by lawyer Bhargavan Sujatha and Pansuk by lawyer Johannes Hadi.

"Not immune to rising costs, but Decathlon says it aims to keep prices 'as low as possible'","The sporting goods retailer also says it wants to launch rental services and more than double the number of stores it has in Singapore.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/decathlon-singapore-keep-prices-low-inflation-rising-costs-2887596,"SINGAPORE: Enter any Decathlon store and you'll find low-priced items across a wide range of sports – from a S$4 hiking backpack to a S$10 badminton racket.
And the French sporting goods retailer hopes to keep it that way, even as it comes under pressure from rising costs on multiple fronts.
“We are not immune to cost increases,” said Decathlon Singapore’s managing director Stephan Veyret, adding that these challenges are “multiple” and “completely uncertain”.
For one, stress on global supply chains is likely to persist due to uncertainties over how the war in Ukraine will pan out, as well as bubbling tensions between the United States and China, he said. COVID-19 outbreaks are another risk, with lockdowns in countries like Vietnam and China previously disrupting supplies of products from hiking shoes to tennis rackets.
Surging energy prices add to transport and manufacturing costs. Currency fluctuations are putting the squeeze on the bottomline and the 1 percentage point increase in Singapore’s Goods and Services Tax at the start of next year will further crimp margins.
With these uncertainties, Mr Veyret said he cannot provide a definitive answer on whether Decathlon will have to adjust its retail prices in Singapore.
“I don't know what will be the impact (of) energy costs, raw material costs and transport costs,"" he told CNA in an interview last week. But if the company were to raise prices, it would be because it had no choice, he added.
But Decathlon will remain focused on being the more affordable option for customers, Mr Veyret said.
The retailer's ability to offer competitive prices since its establishment in 1976 stems from its integrated business model, in which it designs and manufactures almost all its products. Decathlon also has its own logistics arm and eliminates non-essential packaging. All these enable the company to optimise resources and reduce cost at every stage of the process, it says.
Additional cost-cutting steps it takes for its Singapore operations include sourcing from as many different countries as possible but keeping it within the region to minimise logistics costs.
“Our aim is to give access to sports by providing affordable products … and it is in our culture to adapt to rising costs,” said Mr Veyret, who has worked at Decathlon for the last 24 years and took on the top job in Singapore last July.
“We will continue to do as best as we can to make sure that we keep prices as low as possible and continue to (offer) the best quality-price ratio in the market. Because that’s the reason why people come to us.”

GROWTH PLANS IN SINGAPORE
Headquartered in Lille, France, Decathlon first entered Singapore in 2012 as an online store before opening its first ""experience store"" in 2016 in Bedok. It has since opened five more of these mega stores, which carry its full range of 5,000 products and allow customers to try them out.
It also has nine other smaller “click-and-collect” outlets, taking its total number of stores to 15 across Singapore.
While the COVID-19 pandemic spurred some to embrace an active lifestyle or try out other sports, the effect on Decathlon has been mixed as the growth in some sports compensated for the drop in others.
“During the pandemic, home fitness and cycling boomed,” said Mr Veyret. “But at the same time, swimming pools and football pitches were closed so our sales in swimming and football tumbled very heavily. Singaporeans who like to travel could not do so, so hiking, skiing and so on also suffered.”
Now that travel and most domestic restrictive measures have been lifted, the reverse has happened, with sales of hiking gear picking up again while pandemic top-sellers such as dumbbells and yoga mats are falling.
Likewise, as customers return to shopping in its stores, its online website has seen a drop in orders versus a year ago.
“So I wouldn’t say that we have benefited from the pandemic because while the figures exploded on one side, we suffered on the other side,” Mr Veyret said.
But overall, Decathlon is “still growing” and running a profitable business in Singapore, said Mr Veyret. And so the firm intends to grow its presence here to eventually reach 37 stores – an “almost golden number”.
These will mostly be click-and-collect outlets to ensure good coverage across Singapore and that customers have a Decathlon store within 10 minutes from where they live, he said.
It is also planning to open one more experience store in the northern part of Singapore. Such mega stores, said Mr Veyret, serve a different purpose. 
“In France, for example, we have lifelong customers because the first time they rode a bike was in our stores. So the emotion and the relationship you have (with) the brand is very different. That's the aim of the experience stores.”
Decathlon is, however, “not in a rush” to open these new stores. “Time is not the issue,” said Mr Veyret, stressing that the retailer is more focused on quality such as finding “the right location at the right rent”.

New initiative rolled out to help retail sector stay relevant amid changing consumer habits













Beyond physical stores, the retailer, like many others, is also ramping up its online presence.
This is why it launched an online marketplace in May, allowing customers to shop not just Decathlon’s in-house brands from its website and app but also products from other brands. This aims to fulfil the “varied sporting needs and budgets” of its customers, the retailer said in a press release.
Doing so does not cannibalise its own business, said Mr Veyret, noting that the new marketplace only lists external brands that complement its offerings, such as foldable bicycles from European brand Shulz which are of a higher price point.
Decathlon also opened a data lab opposite its experience store in Kallang last month. The 700 sq m space serves as the workspace for its growing digital teams and also incubator for new digital services.
Data is the “goldmine” for retailers in an evolving environment, Mr Veyret explained.
“The customer now shops wherever and whenever he wants, so we have to adapt. One of the keys to that is to know our customers better and serve them better, and in order to do that, we need to gather data to know our customers and to (come up with) solutions.”
Decathlon also intends to partner with external agencies, technology start-ups and students in some of these data projects and solutions. For one, it will be sharing its data with government agency Sport Singapore.
“We will put our data together to understand the needs of our customers and more importantly, the sports people in Singapore, how they behave, what to anticipate in terms of sporting trends here,” said Mr Veyret.
“What we sell today is the practice of tomorrow. So there is a lot of synergy in doing that.”

PUSHING AHEAD WITH SUSTAINABILITY
But as it grows, Decathlon said it wants to do so sustainably and has taken steps to embrace the circular economy model – where items are recycled and reused to cut back on waste and pollution.
One such move is to roll out its own maintenance and repair workshops. These are currently available at all experience stores in Singapore and offer a range of servicing and repair options for bicycles.
Last year, Decathlon followed up with the introduction of a Second life scheme here – where items that have been returned but are still in good condition are repaired and resold at lower prices. These can include bicycles, treadmills and weights like barbells.
A leasing and rental service on a pay-per-use or subscription model is also in the works. This was made available at some Decathlon stores in UK earlier this year, allowing customers to rent products such as e-bikes, kayaks and surfboards. 
The retailer is also mulling a buy-back option further down the road.
“You bought a bike for yourself and after two years, you want to change. You can bring it back, we will purchase it and give you a voucher to buy a new product. The one you returned will be rented, leased or sold second-hand,” Mr Veyret explained.
“We will do as much as we can to not waste anything and to extend the lifespan of our products.
“Instead of selling 10 times more products to 10 times more customers in 10 years, what we want to do is to generate 10 times more value from each product that we sell today.”
And when it comes to producing new items, Mr Veyret said Decathlon aims to be “100 per cent eco-conceived by 2026”, up from 30 per cent currently. This includes the use of more recycled materials and coming up with workarounds to minimise the impact on the environment.
For example, it did away with the dyeing process for its newest tents given how the process usually requires high temperature and uses large amounts of water.
“We are not dyeing our tents. Our new tent is white and not colourful, so as to minimise impact on the planet.”
Among other climate commitments, Decathlon is also targeting to source all its electricity from renewable sources by 2026.
It has also committed to reducing 90 per cent of its total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by then, according to a transition plan updated by the company in January on its strategies for sustainable development between 2020 to 2026. Scope 1 emissions are from direct, controlled sources, while scope 2 emissions are from purchased energy consumption.

Jurong Bird Park's pioneer generation vulture dies,"Rod, an Egyptian Vulture, had been part of the park since it opened in 1971.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jurong-bird-parks-pioneer-generation-vulture-dies-2900196,"SINGAPORE: Jurong Bird Park's pioneer generation vulture and its oldest bird has died at an estimated age of about 60 years old.
In a Facebook post on Thursday (Aug 25), Mandai Wildlife Reserve announced the passing of Rod, an elderly Egyptian Vulture which had been part of Jurong Bird Park since it opened in 1971.
Mandai Wildlife Reserve said that Rod was already an adult when he joined the park and was ""possibly the world’s oldest of his species"".
The reserve said that Rod's lifespan was ""almost three times the natural lifespan of Egyptian Vultures in the wild"".
""Rod was loved and lived a full life at Jurong Bird Park where he, in his younger days, played an integral role in raising awareness of threats faced by his wild counterparts.""
Rod had until recently remained spritely for his age, added the reserve.

The reserve said that being a geriatric bird, Rod had ""age-related health issues"". 
He was placed under the Senior Animal Care Programme from 2018 which included more frequent health checks, a customised diet and feeding, and modified environment to ensure he continued to have a good quality of life. 
Mandai Wildlife Reserve said that after Rod's last assessment by his carers and vets, it was found that his age-related complications had advanced and were ""severely affecting his quality of life"". 
""On welfare grounds, the difficult decision was therefore made to humanely euthanise him.""
Rod left a mark on everyone that has crossed his path over the five decades, but no one more than Clarence Saw, who has known Rod since 1988 when he first joined Jurong Bird Park.
""Rod was a special bird. He was the bird I got to work with the longest, and he was instrumental in honing my bird handling skills in the early years of my career,"" said Mr Saw.
""Rod showed me how truly intelligent and full of personality birds can be. The bird park will not be the same without him and he will be sorely missed.”"
"Singapore and Brunei sign MOUs, reaffirm longstanding relationship: MFA","Singapore and Brunei signed four Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) during a state visit by Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/brunei-sultan-hassanal-bolkiah-state-visit-singapore-mou-2900111,"SINGAPORE: Singapore and Brunei signed four Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and reaffirmed their ""special and longstanding relationship"", Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Thursday (Aug 25).
Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah concluded his two-day state visit to Singapore on Thursday. During his visit, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called on the sultan, who is on his fifth state visit to the country.
In a Facebook post, Mr Lee said: ""We had last met a few weeks ago when I visited Brunei for His Majesty's 76th birthday celebrations. It was good to catch up again and reaffirm our longstanding bilateral relations.""
The sultan's visit was an ""excellent occasion for both countries to also build on our traditional pillars of cooperation, including defence and finance"", said MFA.
""As fellow small countries, Singapore and Brunei are working together to strengthen our resilience in an uncertain climate,"" MFA added.
During the sultan's trip, both countries discussed ways to expand bilateral cooperation. Singapore and Brunei agencies signed MOUs to deepen cooperation in the areas of energy, the green economy, and food and medical supply resilience, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).
""The signing of the two MOUs to strengthen bilateral cooperation in energy, the green economy, and food and medical supply resilience signals our mutual interest in steering our countries towards a more sustainable and resilient future,"" said Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong.
""Singapore will continue to partner Brunei, with whom we share a special friendship, to explore areas of cooperation that will better prepare us for the future.""
The two countries also signed MOUs on the Brunei-Singapore Youth Education Scholarship and on cooperating to develop public service capacity.

"Singapore Buddhist Federation 'grateful' for proposed 377A repeal in tandem with 'edification' of marital, family values",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/section-377a-repeal-institution-marriage-singapore-buddhist-federation-2899946,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF) said on Friday (Aug 26) that it is ""grateful"" for the proposed repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code in tandem with the ""meaningful edification"" of marital and family values held ""dear"" by Singapore society.
""Wholesome faith and gratitude in relationship building including filial piety are core to the practical practice of the Buddha's teachings,” the SBF said in a statement.
Section 377A of the Penal Code criminalises sex between men. Section 12 of the Women's Charter defines marriage as being between a man and a woman; same sex marriages are void.
In the National Day Rally speech last Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Government will repeal Section 377A and amend the Constitution to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts.
SBF is the latest religious organisation to make a statement on the matter. Following the National Day Rally last Sunday, a number of faith and religious groups gave their initial reactions to Mr Lee's announcement.
This included several churches and church groups, the Hindu Advisory Board, the Sikh Advisory Board and the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS).
Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, president of SBF, said at the time that spelling out the definition of marriage in the Constitution would be a good move to prevent more court challenges that will cause divisions in society.

""In recent years, increasing polarity in views has been the cause of animosity and discontent dividing advocates and opponents of this matter,"" said the SBF on Friday.
Instead, healthy facilitation of ""pathways"" to grow genuine conversations and understanding of lived experiences is key to soothing tensions that may have built up over time, it added.
""Meaningful discussion calls for level-headed selfless listening and mutual respect, where peaceful acceptance of differing views can build a foundation for creative inclusion and integration of needs in society,” SBF said.
Reflecting on the history of the Section 377A debate in Singapore going back to 2007, SBF said that the time has come to “move forward with middle-ground dialogue, in order to prevent further polarisation and division” in Singapore.
“We need an inclusive and cohesive society more than ever, to overcome the challenges of unprecedented international crises and geopolitical tension,” the federation said.
“We urge one and all in Singapore to work closely with our government leaders, so that we can, together, look deeply into the genuine inter-generational needs of families.”
In its statement, the SBF said compassion is ""aspiring one and all to be free from suffering"" and the fruit of integrating ""loving-kindness and wisdom"".
“We need to stand in solidarity with all in compassion ... May we help one another feel safe and included,"" it added.
Editor's note: This article has been amended after the SBF issued on Aug 26 a revised version of its statement on Aug 25.

"Jail, caning for duo who attacked man at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery over rape allegation",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/choa-chu-kang-cemetery-assault-attack-wife-rape-allegation-2899926,"SINGAPORE: Two friends were on Thursday (Aug 25) sentenced to jail and caning for assaulting a man at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery over a rape allegation.
Andre Chen Si'en, 31, and Gervan Wong Jun Heng, 26, attacked the victim with various weapons at the secluded cemetery in the early hours of the morning.
They then made the victim crawl to their car before dropping him off near his home, where he left a blood trail getting up to his apartment.
Both men pleaded guilty to a charge each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon.
Additionally, Chen admitted to voluntarily causing grievous hurt in another incident and taking methamphetamine. Seven other charges were considered for sentencing.
He was sentenced to eight years' jail and nine strokes of the cane.
Wong admitted to 13 other charges of voluntarily causing hurt, consuming drugs and driving offences. Twenty more charges were considered for sentencing.
He was sentenced to seven years, three months and 16 weeks in jail, and six strokes of the cane. He was also fined S$2,400 and banned from driving for two years.
Wong was also ordered to compensate the victim more than S$1,000 in medical fees. Chen previously made voluntary compensation.
RAPE ALLEGATION
The court heard that the 29-year-old victim and Chen were friends who had known each other for many years.
On the morning of May 9, 2020, Chen received messages from his wife and her friend alleging that the victim had raped his wife the night before.
Chen was in Wong's house when he got the messages, and told him about the allegation. Wong agreed to accompany Chen to settle the issue with the victim.
Later that night, Chen called the victim out for drinks. The victim agreed, and Chen offered to pick him up from his place.
Before leaving, Chen asked Wong for weapons. Chen armed himself with a knuckleduster and flick knife, while Wong chose a metal baton.
During the journey to the victim's house, both men discussed bringing him to a secluded place where they would attack him if he admitted to raping Chen's wife.
ASSAULT IN CEMETERY
At about 3am on May 10, 2020, Chen and Wong brought the victim to the cemetery, where Chen asked him about the rape allegation.
Chen became incensed by what he felt were ""half-hearted replies"" from the victim, court documents stated.
He hit the back of the victim's head with the knuckleduster, which had two sharp horns. One horn tore a chunk of flesh from the victim's head.
The victim tried to flee, but Chen caught up with him. He continued hitting the victim's head and body, and stabbed his legs with the knife.
Wong joined in with the baton, and the two friends took turns attacking the victim. Chen also took the victim's mobile phone and smashed it against a tombstone.
Both men stopped when they became too tired to continue, after which the victim begged them for some water.
Wong took some water from the car and sprayed it in the victim's face instead. Chen then ordered him to crawl back to the car, and they drove to the victim's place.
Around 5.30am, Chen and Wong left the victim near his apartment block. His mother found him at the doorstep of their home and called emergency services.
The victim suffered a head injury, fractures at his arm and foot, stab wounds, lacerations and bruising. He was hospitalised for two days.
He also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and sought treatment at the Institute of Mental Health. His medical bills amounted to more than S$2,000.
Chen and Wong were arrested on May 10, 2020, and both tested positive for drugs. Chen admitted to taking methamphetamine while Wong admitted to taking ketamine the previous night.
""NO ROOM FOR VIGILANTE JUSTICE""
Chen's defence counsel Kalidass Murugaiyan highlighted the rape allegation as an extenuating factor for the court to consider.
He claimed that when Chen and Wong met the victim, the victim said things that seemed to confirm he had ""not been a good person"", which triggered the attack.
But Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said that the provocation had to come from the victim in order to be considered a mitigating factor.
In this case, the rape claims by Chen's wife and her friend were better described as ""indirect incitement to commit the offence"", he said.
The prosecutor noted that the women did not ask Chen and Wong to hurt the victim.
Mr Kalidass also said that his client showed remorse immediately after the attack, and helped the victim to ""wash his wounds"".
But Mr Huo said this was too charitable a description of spraying water in the victim's face, which was a ""spiteful act"" aimed at humiliating him.
He argued that the attack was premeditated, that Chen and Wong outnumbered the victim and that they caught him off-guard by suddenly attacking him from behind.
The assault was ""vicious and needlessly prolonged"" and the victim was treated cruelly even after the attack ended, said the prosecutor.
Mr Huo also highlighted that both Chen and Wong were on bail when they carried out the attack.
Chen was on bail for assaulting a stranger in a lift at Ming Arcade in April 2019, while Wong, represented by lawyer Teo Choo Kee, was on bail for drug consumption.
Both men were recalcitrant offenders who had previously committed a variety of serious offences, said the prosecutor. For Chen, this included past violence-related convictions.
District Judge Eddy Tham said that while the rape allegation was serious, it was unproven.
""There is no room for vigilante justice here,"" he said, adding that the attack on the victim was clearly vindictive.
By luring the victim out to a deserted place and arming themselves, Chen and Wong showed their intent to inflict brutal injuries on the man, said the judge."

Maid jailed for rough handling of toddler during bedtime routines,"The domestic worker's actions came to light when the victim's father checked a live closed-circuit television feed of his daughter's bedroom last year.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-jail-rough-handle-mistreat-toddler-bedtime-routine-2899831,"SINGAPORE: A domestic worker was jailed for 10 months on Thursday (Aug 25) after she roughly handled a 22-month-old toddler for weeks.
Sri Eha Santika Sari, 29, pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt comprising five incidents in August 2021.
Another charge of committing a rash act that endangered the toddler's safety was considered for sentencing.
The maid started working for the victim's family in December 2020. She admitted to handling the toddler in a rough manner from June 2021.
This included hitting the toddler, flicking her ears, pulling her hair, knocking her head and smacking her feet.
She also pushed the toddler forcefully onto the mattress when she tried to move away, or pulled the toddler's hands and feet when she was restless or did not sleep.
This mostly took place during the toddler's bedtime routine, when the maid was in charge of feeding her and putting her to sleep.
Her actions came to light when the victim's father checked a live closed-circuit television feed of his daughter's bedroom on Aug 28 last year.
He noticed that Sri Eha Santika Sari had grabbed the toddler by her arm and thigh and swung her forcefully onto the mattress.
He confronted the maid on the spot, but she denied any wrongdoing. He later reviewed past CCTV footage, which revealed earlier instances of rough handling.
Videos played in court showed that Sri Eha Santika Sari had handled the toddler in a rough way multiple times from Aug 17 to Aug 28, 2021.
On one occasion, when the toddler sat up after finishing her milk, the maid pushed her head back down to the pillow and pulled her ear forcefully.
Another time, the toddler tried to get up while the maid was patting her to sleep. The maid pushed the toddler's head into the pillow and hit her head.
The victim suffered pain and often cried as a result of these acts, but was unable to seek help given her young age.
After the incident on Aug 28, 2021, Sri Eha Santika Sari continued to live in the flat but stopped caring for the victim.
The toddler's father eventually made a police report on Sep 26, 2021. No injuries were found when the victim was taken to the hospital the next day.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought eight to 10 months' jail, arguing that the toddler was an exceptionally vulnerable victim given her age.
The toddler was entirely defenceless given her inability to seek help and her gross physical disparity with the offender, said the prosecutor.
Furthermore, the maid was entrusted to care for the toddler and abused this trust when alone with her, said Ms Boppana.
Sri Eha Santika Sari asked for leniency, saying that a long sentence meant she would not be able to earn money to send her child to school.
""I admit all of my mistakes,"" she told the judge through an Indonesian interpreter.
District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam said that while no injuries were found on the toddler, the CCTV footage showed the nature of harm inflicted on her.
She noted the offences appeared to have continued with ""fair regularity"" over two to three weeks, and it was fortuitous the toddler's father discovered it before it could continue any longer.
The maid could have been jailed for up to 12 years. She was liable for enhanced punishment as the victim was below 14 and the proceeded charge amalgamated multiple occasions of offending."
"Vaccination-differentiated rules remain for F&B outlets, large events, nightlife venues even as mask-wearing becomes optional",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vaccination-differentiated-safe-management-measures-fnb-events-nightclubs-masks-2899566,"SINGAPORE: Vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) will remain for food and beverage (F&B) outlets, large events and nightlife venues, even as mask-wearing becomes optional for these places from next Monday (Aug 29).
Speaking at a press conference held by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that VDS checks are currently only required for events with more than 500 participants and dining in at F&B outlets. 
However, Mr Wong added that F&B outlets no longer check for vaccination status because the onus is placed on the individual, and random spot checks are conducted by the authorities.
""For now, we are retaining this approach ... there is no change to this because vaccinations are still the best way to protect ourselves against severe disease from COVID-19,"" said Mr Wong. 
This means that only fully vaccinated individuals will be able to dine in at F&B outlets, attend large events with more than 500 participants at any one time or enter nightlife venues. 
The Singapore Nightlife Business Association (SNBA) said it welcomed the continuation of VDS measures for nightlife establishments. 
""Keeping VDS requirements is good, as the high vaccination rates have helped Singapore ride through the last COVID-19 wave,"" said Mr Nasen Thiagarajan, president of the Singapore Nightlife Business Association.

However, mask-wearing at events will be optional from next Monday, said Mr Wong adding that events are not essential services where a higher proportion of older people are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19. 
Mr Wong added that event organisers and venue operators can decide on whether participants will have to wear their masks. 
""Event organisers and venue operators may well decide on a case-by-case basis, depending on the settings, depending on the event, that they would still continue with masks as a requirement,"" he said.
""Allowing optional masks indoors will help guests and staff alike make their own choices. Nightlife establishments can then focus on good customer service and their business as they will not have to keep reminding customers to mask up,"" said Mr Nasen.
He also said that the move will make it a lot easier for staff not handling the preparation of food and drink, as wearing the masks and working for 6 to 8 hours in a nightlife establishment has been uncomfortable for them. 
The Restaurant Association of Singapore also welcomed the easing of mask-wearing rules. 
""We are confident that customers and consumers will continue to exercise discretion and good conscience in not engaging in high-risk activities including masking off when it is inappropriate to do so,"" it said. 
The association, which represents more than 800 brands that operate over 5,000 restaurants, also asked for all restaurant businesses to continue to uphold clean and safe standards such as washing hands properly and regularly sanitising high-touch surfaces. 
From next Monday, people in Singapore will not be required to wear a mask except on public transport and in healthcare facilities. 
Masks will still have to be worn on transport modes such as the MRT, LRT and public buses, as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms. 
But they will not be required at airports, naturally ventilated bus interchanges and in the retail areas of bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations.
Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release on Wednesday.

Forward Singapore exercise to look at better support for people with disabilities: Lawrence Wong,"Speaking at the biennial Inclusive Business Forum 2022 organised by SG Enable, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also said companies are increasingly seeing the ""good business sense"" in being disability-inclusive.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-forward-singapore-better-support-people-disabilities-2899521,"SINGAPORE: The Government's Forward Singapore exercise will continue to consider how to provide better care and support for people with disabilities (PWDs) and to ensure a more inclusive society, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Thursday (Aug 25). 
Mr Wong, who is also Minister of Finance, also called on companies to do more to be disability-inclusive while tapping on the Government's assistance.
Forward Singapore is a year-long exercise which aims to review and refresh Singapore's social compact and set out a roadmap for the next decade and beyond.
He was speaking at the biennial Inclusive Business Forum 2022 organised by SG Enable, an agency dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities.
This year's forum, held at The Theatre at Mediacorp for its fourth edition, explored the potential for organisations to tap on people with disabilities as a talent pool against a backdrop of global talent shortage.
Themed ""The Future of Work: Building Business Resilience and Growth"", the forum will have two panel discussions where business leaders and PWDs will discuss the benefits of inclusion within the workplace.

Better accessibility for persons with disabilities set out in Enabling Masterplan for 2030













Opening the event, Mr Wong said that Singapore's success did not just rely on economic growth, but also how inclusive it was as a society. 
He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped paved the way for a more inclusive work environment. Employers were prepared to hire PWDs to fill in manpower gaps in a tight labour market. 
Firms made greater use of technology to facilitate work, which helped open employers to working with assistive technologies, such as speech recognition software. These could help PWDs function in the workplace. Flexible work arrangements also aided in the employment of PWDs. 
But more can be done, he said.  
""We have to do more to ensure everyone can participate fully in the progress of our nation. And for persons with disabilities, we will have to build on what we have achieved so far.""
Mr Wong cited the Enabling Masterplan 2030 released last week, where the Government set a target of achieving an employment rate of 40 per cent for PWDs, an increase from the 30 per cent currently. 
To support the employability of PWDs, the Government already offsets up to 20 per cent of their wages through the Enabling Employment Credit and defrays up to 90 per cent of the cost of workplace modifications and equipment to help companies accommodate PWDs' unique needs.
Firms play the most important role, Mr Wong noted. More companies are being accredited with the Enabling mark, an SG Enable accreditation that recognises organisations for their best practices and outcomes in disability-inclusive employment. 
Mr Wong named Microsoft, Thong Siek Food Industry and VITAL, a government agency under the Ministry of Finance, as a few examples.  
""If we want to see a sustainable improvement in the employment outcomes of persons with disabilities, businesses must see it in their interest to hire such people – not out of charity, not out of social good alone, but because businesses truly believe in the benefits of disability-inclusive hiring,"" he said. 
Employers were increasingly seeing the ""good business sense"" of being disability-inclusive, according to Mr Wong. 
He shared results of a study commissioned by SG Enable which showed that employees working in companies with disability-inclusive practices reported a greater sense of purpose, leading to higher retention rates among existing employees. 
These firms also showed a greater focus on customer needs, and a more collaborative and innovative culture, as employees became more empathetic and more open to discussing new ideas, Mr Wong said. 
Companies who were worried about the challenges of disability-inclusive hiring could consider starting with small-scale internship programmes or with a few full-time hires, such as Microsoft and Thong Siek did, he added. 
Firms may also tap on SG Enable, from job matching and training to job redesign and grant support. 
""Ultimately, persons with disabilities do want to work and if given the chance, have many valuable skills to offer. And as a society we owe it to them to give them this opportunity. So let’s all do our part to get 40 per cent of persons with disabilities employed by 2030,"" said Mr Wong."
Developers urged to pay contractors safety bonus as workplace accidents rise,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/work-safety-accidents-construction-developer-redas-2899381,"SINGAPORE: The Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) will encourage its members to pay out safety bonuses to incentivise contractors with good Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) performance.
These will be given out at specific project milestones, to promote safer work practices. 
“This would be a strong carrot in aligning contractors’ business interests with good WSH practices,” said Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad on Thursday (Aug 25).
He added that developers have “tremendous influence” as service buyers to raise safety standards and reward contractors for good safety performance.
Mr Zaqy also announced other measures to improve workplace safety at the REDAS Safety Leadership Forum held at the Fullerton Hotel.
There have been 34 workplace deaths to date this year. Construction workplace deaths have been trending up after COVID-19 work stoppages, and of the fatalities this year, 12 cases or almost 40 per cent were from the construction industry.

Body of worker who fell into the sea at Keppel Shipyard in Tuas found













The number of major injuries this year is “similarly worrying”, said Mr Zaqy. Despite an overall drop over the last decade, the construction industry recorded 84 major injuries so far in the first half of 2022.
This would be the worst performance since 2014 if the figure is annualised to the whole of 2022, which the senior minister of state called “disheartening and unacceptable”.
Giving the opening address at the forum, Mr Zaqy noted that the inculcation of a safety culture must start with top management, and that property developers sit at the “very top of the construction sector”.
“As developers, you are in the best position to take safety leadership because you set WSH standards through your contract specifications when selecting contractors,” he said.
“You determine the pace of work, and you are also in a position to reward safe behaviour and penalise poor ones.”
President of REDAS Chia Ngiang Hong said that leadership styles are moving from a top-down hierarchical approach to being more collaborative.
""Today's construction and infrastructure projects are increasingly complex and larger in scale, which place even greater importance on safety at worksites through collaborative leadership,"" he said.
He added that collaborative leadership is even more important in times where there is a manpower crunch amid construction backlogs, cost escalation, supply chain issues and financial challenges.
ENHANCED MEASURES FOR SAFETY
Giving a rundown of MOM’s enhanced measures to address the recent spate of accidents, Mr Zaqy said that the ministry has stepped up enforcement and doubled fines for WSH infringements.
He said that workers need to feel empowered to raise safety issues they see on the ground, so signboards at construction sites will show a QR code linking to MOM, together with its safety hotline.
“They should raise red flags to their supervisors, but if the supervisors do not listen, they need to know how they can report to MOM,” he said.
The ministry has also revised the WSH Guidelines for Design for Safety, and provided detailed checklists for the reference of developers and contractors. This way, they can incorporate safety in the planning and design phase of projects, said Mr Zaqy.
He also highlighted that companies need to be self-motivated to be safe and this often depends on the culture and processes set by top management.
To encourage that, MOM is finalising the Code of Practice (COP) on Chief Executives’ and Board of Directors’ WSH Duties and The draft COP is available for public consultation.

Have minimum rest hours, improve channels to report lapses in workplace safety, says Melvin Yong













The COP will spell out WSH responsibilities for management and boards, and the courts may consider the COP when assessing the culpability of company leaders and its board, when an accident occurs.
“Some specific ways to set and demand high WSH standards are: To take vendors’ and contractors’ WSH performance into account when choosing them; to disqualify unsafe companies from being awarded your contracts; and
to reward vendors and contractors with good WSH performance,” he said.
The safety bonus would be one way to reward the companies with good practices. 
“Here, I would like to commend the REDAS members that already have this good practice,” said Mr Zaqy.
“For example, Keppel Land and City Developments Limited, who have both introduced incentive schemes for good WSH performance for all their projects.
“I look forward to more REDAS members demonstrating such strong safety leadership.”
Mr Zaqy noted that some REDAS members are also using technology to improve safety standards.
Ms Tay Seok Cheng, head of projects at CDL, said that the developer has paid out rewards for more than 20 years to main contractors who achieve sterling safety results. Contractors who ace their safety assessments for the entire year can get a sum of S$30,000.
Ms Tay said that this incentive has worked well for CDL and motivates their subcontractors and workers to be safe.
""It's about whether you believe safety is really important. I think human life should not be neglected; everybody should do their part on that,"" said Ms Tay.
Developers can also use the enhanced e-service CheckSAFE to find out more about a company’s safety record when appointing vendors.
“Taking CheckSafe records into account when selecting contractors will create a virtuous cycle where main contractors will equate safety performance with business opportunities and result in them managing your sites and choosing their sub-contractors with safety in mind,” he said.
“In the end, developers benefit from stronger safety performance, lower risk of work stoppage due to accidents, and certainly a better reputation.”
Singapore as a whole has a good reputation for safety, but standards have slipped recently due to COVID-19, said Mr Zaqy.
""This is something we need to review ... we've made a lot of improvements, so let's continue and let's keep up Singapore as one of the safest countries to work for.""

Commentary: Why do workplace accidents keep repeating themselves in Singapore?"
Former Changi Prison officer jailed for passing confidential information to inmate,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/changi-prison-officer-jailed-10-weeks-confidential-information-inmate-2898151,"SINGAPORE: A former Changi prison officer was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail on Wednesday (Aug 24) for unlawfully accessing and communicating confidential information.
Muhammad Fattahullah Mohd Nordin pleaded guilty to two charges of accessing the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) computer system without authority to obtain confidential information on inmates’ locations and passing them to an inmate.
The inmate, Abdul Karim Mohamed Kuppai Khan, was supposedly the headman of a secret society, court documents showed.
In November 2020, SPS began internal investigations after several contraband items and a note containing confidential information were found in an inmate’s cell during a routine check.
The investigations revealed that two former prison officers had allegedly accessed and provided confidential information to the inmate on separate occasions.

According to court documents, Abdul Karim asked Fattahullah on at least five occasions between January and June 2020 for information about other inmates, including their locations.
Fattahullah admitted to providing the information in hopes that Abdul Karim, who was known to be disruptive, would not create problems for him during his night shifts.
SPS referred the case to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and interdicted the two prison officers from service. They both subsequently resigned.
""All SPS staff undergo training on the proper handling of confidential information,"" said SPS.
""Regular bulletins are also disseminated to SPS staff to emphasise the importance of securing confidential information, and the importance of remaining professional at all times when dealing with inmates."" 
The consequences of breaching these regulations are also clearly made known to SPS staff, it said, adding that it takes a serious view of any wrongful access and communication of confidential information. 
""Any SPS staff found to have done so will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law, including being charged in court, as was done in this case,"" said SPS.
Court proceedings of the other former prison officer, Muhammad Zul Helmy Abdul Latip, who was charged with similar offences, are ongoing."
"'Happy that we can choose': Some taxi, private hire drivers look forward to driving without masks","Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis and private hire vehicles from Aug 29.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/taxi-drivers-masks-passengers-grab-private-hire-2897691,"SINGAPORE: Some taxi and Grab drivers welcomed the relaxed mask rules from Monday (Aug 29) but some told CNA that they would continue to keep their masks on.
Starting next Monday, people in Singapore will not be required to wear a mask except on public transport and in healthcare facilities, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced on Wednesday.
Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services. 
""The taxi driver can suggest, request, but there is no law to require ... This is not enforceable, there is no basis of law for the taxi driver to say you have to. It's optional,"" said Mr Wong.
In response to CNA's queries, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it encouraged drivers and passengers of taxi and private-hire operators to continue wearing masks, especially if drivers are ferrying passengers who are unwell.

Taxi, private-hire drivers and passengers encouraged to wear masks although no longer mandatory: LTA



















Wearing a mask to be optional from Aug 29, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities













HAPPY TO NOT WEAR A MASK 
Some drivers plan to embrace the relaxed rules and do away with masks from Monday.  
A 53-year-old Grab driver who only wanted to be known as Mark said he only wears a mask now because it is required. He takes it off after his passengers alight.
With masks being optional, he does not plan to wear one. 
“The reason (is) because I am vaccinated and I had COVID-19 in July. Anyway, currently out of 10 people, about six would either not wear their mask properly or pull it down. I got tired of telling them to mask up,” he told CNA. 
“After I had COVID-19, I basically did not get bothered much, but if I hear them cough or have a runny nose, I do ask them to mask up.”
So far, passengers have been understanding when Mark asks them to wear their masks properly. But he believes most people will not wear a mask in the car from next week. 
“Personally, I am happy that we can choose not to wear them from next week,” he added. “(But) Grab (has given) us a pack of masks. So if the rider forgets to bring theirs, I do offer them a mask.” 
Grab told CNA that it does not require drivers or passengers to wear masks, but strongly encouraged them to do so if they feel unwell.
Another Grab driver who contracted COVID-19 before expressed similar sentiments as Mark. David Lee, 38, said he will not wear a mask since it is not mandatory inside private hire cars.
He plies the road at least 12 hours a day, for six days a week. 
“Firstly, I have recovered from COVID-19 and strongly believe we should live with the virus while taking great care of ourselves, especially with hygiene. Secondly, it can get really stuffy or suffocating to be wearing a mask inside a vehicle and under the treacherous weather,” he said. 
“But I will still continue to sanitise the car every two to three hours or so.”
Mr Lee does not expect his passengers to wear their masks since he will not be wearing one himself. But he hopes they will still practise social responsibility and wear a mask if they think they have a cough or flu, especially a bad one. 
“In the case of the passenger being unwell and refusing to wear a mask, actually there’s nothing we can do about it because we will only notice it about five minutes after picking them up,” he added. 
“Given the guidelines, we can’t (drop) passengers as and where we deem fit, apart from their chosen location, unless in extreme cases of bodily threat. So for me, in this case, I will wear a mask if the passenger is unwell and refuses to wear one.” 
As for 45-year-old William Tan, a private hire driver of a luxury vehicle, he is looking forward to driving without a mask. 
“As I am driving a luxury vehicle, the distance between me and my passengers is (quite a bit). Thus it wouldn’t be an issue or be hazardous to health if I'm not wearing a mask,"" he added.
Mr Tan suggested that taxi drivers who prefer their passengers to mask up should put up a sticker to inform them. In the case of private hire vehicle drivers, they can send the passenger a “courtesy message” before picking them up. 
“This way, it would minimise the unhappiness between drivers and passengers,” he said.

KEEPING MASKS ON
Not all drivers plan to remove their masks on the job, even if they are happy for their passengers to do so.
“I will continue to wear (my mask) when inside my taxi. I am used to wearing a mask everywhere I go, except during meal times,” said Mr Toh Swee Bin, who has been a taxi driver for almost nine years. 
The 46-year-old admitted that he currently has passengers who forget their masks, but he is “okay with it”. 
“Because I think it’s time for the Government to be relaxed on this issue,” he said. 
Taxi driver Soh Lai Kim, 62, prefers to keep his mask on. Even though he has contracted COVID-19 and has also received his booster shot, his wife has not been infected. 
Mr Toh told CNA that he cannot force his passengers to put on their masks as he knows it will be optional from Monday.
“If they cough, I will just remind them, 'please can you help me ... Put on your mask'. They will usually listen to me when I ask them,” he said.

Wearing a mask to be optional from Aug 29, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities
From next Monday (Aug 29), masks will be optional in most places in Singapore.
Masks will still have to be worn on public transport modes such as the MRT, LRT and public buses.
But they will not be required at airports, naturally ventilated bus interchanges or in retail areas. Masks will also be optional on taxis, school buses, private bus services and other private transport modes. 
Flag carrier Singapore Airlines says masks will not be required on its flights unless travelling to or from destinations that require it. The Land Transport Authority says taxi and private-hire drivers as well as passengers are encouraged to continue wearing masks.
Here's a detailed look at what you need to know about going mask-free indoors.
Separately, non-fully vaccinated travellers will be allowed to enter Singapore without being required to apply for approval or observe a 7-day stay-home notice. The requirement for a COVID-19 pre-departure test remains.
A second COVID-19 booster, to be taken from five months after the first, is now recommended for people aged 60 and above in Singapore.
A booster dose is also recommended for children aged 5 to 11.
Thai court suspends PM Prayut from official duty pending term limit review
Thailand's constitutional court has suspended Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha from official duty.
The move follows a petition to review his legally mandated eight-year term limit. It is unclear when the court will deliver a final ruling on the case, which was brought by the opposition.

Tanjong Pagar car crash: Coroner rules accident that killed 5 people was a traffic misadventure
A fatal car crash that killed five people at Tanjong Pagar Road last year was a traffic-related misadventure, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled.
The driver of the car, Jonathan Long Junwei, was speeding and drink-driving in the moments before the crash, the coroner's inquiry heard.
Judge Nakhoda noted the car was travelling at ""staggering"" speeds averaging 148 kmh to 182 kmh.
All five men died of severe burns in the fire that engulfed the car and shophouse.
Body of worker who fell into the sea at Keppel Shipyard in Tuas found
The body of a worker who fell into the sea after part of a concrete pier at Keppel Shipyard in Tuas collapsed was found on Wednesday morning. 
The 38-year-old Bangladeshi worker had been on the pier when it collapsed. Four other workers suffered minor injuries and are in stable condition.

Tanjong Pagar car crash: Coroner rules accident that killed 5 people was a traffic misadventure,"The driver and all four passengers died when their car crashed into a shophouse on Tanjong Pagar Road and was engulfed by flames.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tanjong-pagar-road-car-crash-accident-coroner-inquiry-2897331,"SINGAPORE: A fatal car crash that killed five people at Tanjong Pagar Road last year was a traffic-related misadventure, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda ruled on Wednesday (Aug 24).
The driver of the car, Mr Jonathan Long Junwei, and all four passengers – Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, Mr Teo Qi Xiang and Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh – died in the collision at about 5.40am on Feb 13, 2021.
All of them were colleagues or ex-colleagues who had gathered at Hong Jjajang restaurant on Tanjong Pagar Road for Chinese New Year celebrations earlier that night.
Mr Long was speeding and drink-driving in the moments before the crash, the court previously heard during a coroner's inquiry into the deaths.
Forensic analysis showed the BMW M4 Coupe was travelling at ""staggering"" speeds averaging 148 kmh to 182 kmh when Mr Long was driving, Judge Nakhoda said.
The speed limit on Tanjong Pagar Road was 50 kmh.
Judge Nakhoda said this showed a ""shocking lack of consideration"" for Mr Long's own safety, as well as the safety of his passengers and other road users.
A police investigator also testified that Mr Long's blood alcohol level was 86mg per 100ml at the time, which is above the legal limit of 80mg.
Prior to the crash, the car was driven three rounds around a circuit on Tanjong Pagar Road, with different drivers each time.
The circuit went from Hong Jjajang restaurant at 93 Tanjong Pagar Road towards Keppel. A U-turn at Enggor Street brought the car back along Tanjong Pagar Road towards Maxwell, before it then made another U-turn near 37 Tanjong Pagar Road to return to the restaurant.
During these rounds, Mr Long was ""very persuasive"" and ""insisted"" on competing to see who could drive faster, according to evidence cited by the police investigator.
Judge Nakhoda said there appeared to have been an ""element of bravado"". He said it appeared that Mr Long had intended to show the others how fast the car could be driven.
But there was no evidence that Mr Long had encouraged or cajoled anyone to get into the car. They appeared to have entered voluntarily and there was clear excitement among them, said the judge.
When it was his turn for the fourth round, Mr Long lost control of the car. It drifted, swerved and rotated almost 180 degrees, before mounting the kerb and rear-ending a pillar at a shophouse at 37 Tanjong Pagar Road.
Before that, Mr Long may have been braking heavily as white smoke could be seen emerging from the car's tyres in video footage of the incident, said Judge Nakhoda.

Autopsies determined that all five men died of severe burns in the fire that engulfed the car and shophouse into which it crashed. Mr Teo and Mr Wong also died of a cervical spine injury and pelvic injuries respectively.
Three of the bodies were identified through fingerprints a day after the incident, while the remaining two bodies were identified by DNA profiling on Feb 16, 2021.
The fire originated from the car's undercarriage, a senior fire investigator from the Singapore Civil Defence Force previously testified.
The collision severely damaged the car's exhaust system and also ruptured its fuel tank, causing petrol to leak and vaporise.
As vaporised petrol accumulated in the narrow space under the car, it likely ignited after coming into contact with the hot surface of the exhaust system. Combustible plastics in the vehicle's undercarriage could also have been another source of fuel for the fire.
Firefighters responding to calls for assistance arrived at the scene at 5.46am, but were unable to approach the car due to the intensity of the heat.
They managed to extinguish the blaze at 6.08am, and the bodies were subsequently extricated from the vehicle.
Judge Nakhoda said that the Traffic Police had warned of the dangers of drink-driving, speeding and a combination of both, which could have devastating consequences.
He said the case should serve as a reminder to people to never drive under the influence of alcohol, and even less so in combination with excessively fast speeds and bravado.
A ""moment of recklessness"" cost Mr Long his life and also led to the death of his four passengers, said the judge.
He also emphasised the importance of wearing seatbelts when travelling in a car, pointing to the cervical injuries suffered by Mr Teo.
Mr Teo, who was seated in the centre rear seat, did not have access to a seatbelt. It could not be determined if the other people in the car were wearing seatbelts due to the damage the car sustained. 
After the hearing, Mr Long's father told reporters that the release of the coroner's findings brought closure to his family, saying: ""We have to move on.""
He said his family also continued to support his son's former girlfriend Ms Raybe Oh, whom he referred to as ""my daughter"".
Ms Oh, who was with the group on the night of the crash, ran into the flames to try to help the car's occupants. She suffered severe burns.
A coroner's inquiry is a fact-finding process to look into the circumstances that led to a death. Coroners are prohibited from framing a finding to determine any question of criminal liability.

Students under financial assistance scheme to get higher subsidies from next year,"About 44,000 needy students will benefit from the enhanced financial support amid rising costs, said the Ministry of Education.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ministry-education-financial-assistance-scheme-increase-needy-students-2023-2897446,"SINGAPORE: Primary and secondary school students under the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will get higher transport and meal subsidies from next year amid rising costs.
Bursaries for pre-university students will also be enhanced, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a news release on Wednesday (Aug 24).
About 44,000 students will benefit from the move, which kicks in on Jan 1, 2023. 
The financial assistance scheme helps to defray the cost of basic schooling expenses for students from lower income households.
From January, the monthly school bus subsidy for primary school students will be increased to 65 per cent of the bus fare, up from the current 60 per cent.  
The public transport subsidy for primary to pre-university students will increase from S$15 to S$17 a month.  
For school meal subsidies in primary schools, the provision will be increased from S$2 to S$2.60 per school meal for seven meals a week. For secondary schools students, it will go up from S$2.90 to S$3.50, for 10 meals per school week.
Bursaries for pre-university students will also rise from the current S$1,000 per year to S$1,200.
PRICING CAP ADJUSTMENT FOR SCHOOL BUS FARES
The pricing cap for school bus fares under existing school bus contracts between schools and bus operators will be allowed to rise by 7 per cent, in a one-time increase.
School bus fares are set by operators through a bidding process with the schools and come with a pricing cap that is fixed for a number of years.
But MOE said that the rise in fuel and manpower costs has made it more challenging for operators to sustain their business at pricing caps that had been fixed before fuel prices went up.
""This will let bus operators exercise the flexibility to raise their fares up to the revised cap, if necessary, to continue providing transport services to students, while keeping their operations sustainable,"" said MOE.
Students who require financial assistance will receive more support through the enhancements to the FAS, and additional help through school-based FAS if needed, said MOE. 
It added that it will continue to monitor developments and work closely with school bus operators to ensure that fares are kept affordable for students.

Strides Mobility also encouraged its drivers to take precautionary measures like winding down the windows whenever possible, said its senior general manager Yeow How Pheng. 
Meanwhile, Grab told CNA it ""strongly encourages"" both driver-partners and passengers to continue exercising personal social responsibility, adding that they should wear a mask if they feel unwell.
The ride-hailing firm also encouraged driver-partners to increase the ventilation of vehicles by avoiding the use of recirculation mode of the air-conditioning system, and to regularly clean and disinfect their vehicles.
""If agreeable by the passengers and partners, wind down windows to improve air ventilation,"" it added. 
ComfortDelGro, Singapore's largest taxi operator, pointed to the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) Facebook page when asked about the company's policy on mask-wearing.
LTA's Facebook post reiterated the announcement by the Health Ministry that masks will be optional from Aug 29, except on public buses and trains, as well as indoor public transport settings such as boarding areas within bus interchanges and after passing through fare gates at underground MRT stations.
Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services.

Besides public transport, mask-wearing will still be required in healthcare facilities, residential care homes and ambulances.
Explaining the requirement for masks in these places, co-chair of the COVID-19 task force Lawrence Wong said these are ""areas where essential services are being carried out in enclosed and crowded spaces, and which are frequently used by vulnerable persons"".
Responding to a reporter's question about whether employers can mandate masks at the workplace, Mr Wong said businesses have the discretion to decide. 
""That option remains because we are lifting the mandatory requirement for mask-wearing. But it is optional, employers may choose to decide. For that matter, in certain settings, industry regulators might also decide that it is a safety requirement,"" he added.
For instance, food handlers will still have to wear masks or a spit guard.
On flights, mask-wearing requirements will depend on the rules or laws in the destination country as well as the airline. 
Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that its passengers will not be required to wear masks on flights from Aug 29 unless they are travelling to and from destinations that mandate it.

"Prosecution appeals for jail time for ex-Prive Group CEO who punched, slapped teenager","Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han asked a 13-year-old boy lewd questions, punched his temple and slapped him in a shopping mall lift in 2019, while he was intoxicated.
",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ex-prive-group-ceo-appeal-jean-luc-kha-vu-han-psychiatric-condition-2897136,"SINGAPORE: The prosecution on Wednesday (Aug 24) appealed for jail time for the convicted former CEO of food and beverage group The Prive Group.
Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han asked a 13-year-old boy lewd questions, punched his temple and slapped him in a shopping mall lift in 2019. He was intoxicated at the time.
He was previously sentenced to a 12-month mandatory treatment order (MTO) after pleading guilty to a charge each of voluntarily causing hurt and intentionally causing alarm.
An MTO directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment.
Vu Han was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. An Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist found that there was a contributory link between his psychiatric condition and the offence.
A district judge previously described his offences as ""deplorable"", but said they were ""not so heinous as to rule out the rehabilitation of (Vu Han) completely as the dominant sentencing consideration"".
Justice Vincent Hoong reserved judgment for a later date, after both parties presented arguments at the High Court.
VU HAN'S PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION
Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong and Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Yong Ngee argued that awarding an MTO on the facts of the case would ""send the wrong message"" on protecting the public interest.
""This was a senseless, unprovoked assault perpetrated against a young victim, resulting in both physical and psychological harm,"" they said, calling for a short jail sentence.
The prosecution had sought at least eight weeks' jail and a fine.
The incident on Nov 22, 2019 took place when Vu Han, his friend, the victim and the victim's 12-year-old brother were in a lift in Parklane Shopping Mall.
Vu Han asked the victim a question about his private parts and asked the victim if he wanted to see his private parts, to which the victim replied no.
Vu Han then said that he could arrange a sex act for the victim. The boy was alarmed and said no.
Vu Han suddenly punched the boy on his temple and said, ""You want to challenge me?"" He later also slapped the victim's cheek.
The victim suffered a bruise on his temple and redness on his arm. After the incident, he experienced fear of taking lifts, had flashbacks of the incident and could not sleep well.
The prosecutors said that Vu Han first saw a psychiatrist almost a year after the offences were committed, and that his psychiatric evaluation took place only after he was charged in June 2020.
They also said that Vu Han was initially diagnosed by another doctor with adjustment disorder, but ""abandoned"" this for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
""Taken cumulatively, we submit that the psychiatric diagnosis was sought for the purpose of seeking an MTO in this case,"" the prosecutors contended.
They argued that there was no indication Vu Han had difficulty appreciating the nature of his actions or that his bipolar disorder impaired his self-control.
Calling the link between Vu Han's psychiatric condition and his offences ""tenuous"", the prosecutors said there needed to be a ""direct and proximate link"".
""Otherwise, every instance of mental illness can be used as an excuse for criminal conduct, even if the said illness does not, in fact, contribute to the offence,"" they argued.
PUBLIC INTEREST OR PUBLIC SENTIMENT?
Vu Han's lawyer Ms Teh Ee-Von questioned whether the prosecution was motivated by the public interest or public sentiment.
""The deputy public prosecutor should not allow public sentiment to sway their arguments. Justice should be blind in the sense that offenders with similar offences causing similar harm should be treated in the same way,"" she said.
In response, Mr Tai said he would take the unusual step of explaining in open court why the prosecution was appealing the case.
He said that the way the case had been argued in the lower court, the outcome and how it was reasoned in the judgment were ""quite disturbing"" to the prosecution.
He also said that the public interest was strong as this case would set a precedent for how other cases were argued, and could raise questions about how the legal system deals with such offences.
Ms Teh argued that her client had shown a lot of rehabilitative potential, having voluntarily sought psychiatric treatment.
Referring to Vu Han's initial diagnosis of adjustment disorder, she said her client sought a second medical opinion as he still felt poorly and felt that something was not right with his treatment.
She also pointed out that her client stopped drinking after learning that the symptoms of bipolar disorder could be exacerbated by alcohol. Vu Han was not aware of his condition at the time of the offence, she said.
The lawyer challenged the prosecution's description of the attack as unprovoked, arguing that a psychiatrist had found Vu Han was likely having a manic episode with possible psychosis during the incident.
Citing the psychiatrist's findings, Ms Teh said Vu Han believed he had heard the boy making remarks about the conversation he was having with his friend in the lift before the offence.
The attack may appear to have been unprovoked on the outside, but internally, it was sparked by Vu Han's bipolar disorder, she argued."

In a statement on Wednesday, Keppel Shipyard expressed its condolences to the family of the subcontract worker, a 38-year-old Bangladeshi, and said it is working closely with the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and review.
""Keppel Shipyard values the safety and life of every worker and we deeply regret this tragic incident,"" the company said. 
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Wednesday that it retrieved a body floating in the water near the incident site, adding that the worker was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.
According to the police, the body was recovered at about 8.30am on Wednesday.
The workplace accident happened on Monday morning when part of the concrete pier that a crane was standing on collapsed, causing the crane to topple onto a vessel that was berthed next to the pier, a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson said.
The 38-year-old worker, who was on the pier, fell into the sea and was reported missing. The missing worker was employed by Kumarann Marine.
The incident at 51 Pioneer Sector 1 of Keppel Shipyard caused the crane to be partially submerged under water.
Four other workers – two Bangladeshis, one Chinese national and one Singaporean – suffered minor injuries and are in stable condition, said the MOM spokesperson. 
MOM said it is investigating the cause of the accident and has stopped all works at the pier.

MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak said during a press conference that when it comes to international flights, the requirement depends on what the rules are in the destination of choice as well as the airline.
""The carrier may have requirements imposed based on his country of origin as well, so where there's a mandatory requirement for masks to be worn ... the mask must be worn on the flight itself,"" he said.
However, there are countries where mask-wearing may be optional, like in the United States, he added.
""In that setting, where countries do not enforce or will not require mask-wearing, flights to those destinations will not require mandated wearing on board the flight as long as the carrier has no such requirement as a condition for travel on that particular carrier as well,"" said Assoc Prof Mak.
This means that passengers will need to wear their masks on outbound commercial flights and ferries from Singapore to destinations that require mask-wearing onboard. This also goes for inbound commercial flights and ferries into Singapore from destinations that require mask-wearing onboard, the MOH said.
But masks are not required on outbound commercial flights and ferries from Singapore to destinations that do not require mask-wearing onboard, and inbound commercial flights and ferries into Singapore from destinations that do not require mask-wearing onboard.
Singapore Airlines said its passengers will not be required to wear masks on flights from Aug 29 unless they are travelling to or from destinations that mandate it. The airline provided a list of destinations where masks are required.

HEALTHCARE FACILITIES
Healthcare facilities, residential care homes and ambulances will keep the mask-wearing requirement. These include welfare and sheltered homes for the aged, as well as adult disability homes. 
The same goes for COVID-19 care facilities, testing centres and vaccination centres.
Masks will also be needed at retail and F&B establishments and common areas located within hospital buildings, national specialty centres and polyclinics.
However, masks are not required at physiotherapy and other allied health clinics for services like speech therapy and occupational therapy located outside hospitals, MOH said. Masks are also not needed at facilities providing non-residential community services like centre-based service, day care services and home care services.

SCHOOLS
While the multi-ministry task force did not provide information on mask-wearing in schools during its press conference on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said earlier in his National Day Rally speech that masks should not be needed during classes.
“The children do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other ... It's crucial for their learning and development,” he said.
RULES FOR FOOD HANDLERS
Existing sector requirements on mask-wearing for food handlers continue to apply, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in a statement on Wednesday.
SFA made it a requirement in April 2020 for all food handlers to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers.
This applies to all personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at retail F&B establishments, including hawker centres, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, trade fairs, and non-retail food establishments, including food processing establishments and slaughterhouses, SFA said.
""All food handlers will still be required to wear over his nose and mouth a mask or spit guard that is capable of preventing any substance expelled from his mouth or nose from contaminating food,"" SFA said.
Face shields are not allowed because they are not considered as being effective physical barriers, due to a large gap at the bottom of the shield.
Those bringing plated food to consumers, collecting payments, or who are involved in cleaning work need not wear masks, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor.
